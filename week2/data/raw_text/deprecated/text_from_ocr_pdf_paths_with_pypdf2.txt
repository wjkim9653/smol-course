Scientists  have been able to gather information  about atoms without  actually  seeing
them. Perform  the following  activity  to get an idea about the structure  of the atom.
Take an onion. It looks solid. Peel off a layer, and you will find another  layer
underneath.  Layer after layer surfaces  as the onion is peeled  off. Keep on peeling
to its core.
Analysis
1. How do you compare  this with the atomic  model?
2. What do the layers represent  in the atomic  model?
3. What does the core represent  in the atom?
Two thousand  years ago, ancient  Greek philosophers  developed  a theory of matter
that was not based on the experimental  evidences.  A notable  Greek philosopher,
namely,  Democritus,  believed  that all matter  was composed  of very tiny, indivisible
particles.  He called them atomos.  Hence,  the word ‘atom’ came from the Greek  word
atomos,  which means uncuttable  or indivisible.
Aristotle  was part of the generation  that succeeded  Democritus.  He did not believe  in
atomos.  Aristotle  thought  that all matter  was continuous.  That is, if one proceeded  on
breaking  down a substance,  it would be impossible  to reach to the last indivisible
particle.  In other words, 1t would continue  to divide infinitely.  His opinion  was
accepted  for nearly 200 years.
The early concept  of atoms was simply  a result of thinking  and reasoning  on the part
of the philosophers,  instead  of experimental  observations.  In 1803, however,  John
Dalton  proposed  a completely  different  theory of matter. His theory was based on
scientific  experimental  observations  and logical laws. These scientific  assumptions  were

very closely  related  to what is presently  known  about the atom. Due to this, John
Dalton  is often referred  to as the father of modern  atomic  theory.
Dalton also worked  on the relative  masses of atoms and gave symbols  to some
elements  as illustrated  in Figure 1.1.
Competencies
By the end of this section,  you will be able to:
¢ describe  Dalton’s  atomic  theory;
¢ describe  modern  atomic  theory; and
* compare  and contrast  Dalton’s  atomic  theory  with modern  atomic  theory.
Activity  1.1
Form a group and discuss the following  idea: Dalton’s  contribution  was different  from that
of the ancient  Greeks who postulated  the existence  of atoms. Point out the differences
between  the two ideas. Present  your discussion  to the class.
Even though  the idea of the existence  of atoms and atomic theory dates back to
classical  times, as discussed  earlier, only Dalton's  atomic  theory ideas were the basis
for the new era of science.
British physicist  and chemist  John Dalton is best known for
developing  the atomic theory of elements  and molecules,  the
foundation  of modern physical science.  While pondering  the
nature of the atmosphere  during a meteorological  study in the
early 1800s, Dalton deduced  the structure  of carbon  dioxide  and
proposed  that an exact number  of atoms constitute  each
molecule.  He held that all atoms of a given element  are identical
and different  from the atoms of every other element.  The first to
classify elements  according  to their atomic weights,  Dalton set
the stage for a revolution  in scientific  thought.John Dalton
@ chemisteyrave9
In 1804, John Dalton  developed  the first modern  theory of atoms and proposed  their
existence.  Dalton's  atomic  theory was based directly  on the ideas of elements  and
compounds,  and on the three laws of chemical  combination.  The three laws are:
i) The law of conservation  of mass states that matter is neither created nor
destroyed.  This law is also called the law of indestructibility  of matter. It means
that the mass of the reactants  is exactly  equal to the mass of the products  in
any chemical  reaction. A chemical  reaction  involves  only the separation  and union
of atoms.
ii) The law of definite  proportions  states that a pure compound  is always
composed  of the same elements  combined  in a definite  ratio by mass. For
example,  water (H,O) is composed  of hydrogen  and oxygen  only. These elements
are always in the proportion  of 11.19%  hydrogen  to 88.81%  oxygen  by mass
and in the proportion  2 : 1 by volume.
iii) The law of multiple  proportions  states that when two different  compounds  are
formed  from the same elements,  the masses  of one of the elements  in the two
compounds,  compared  to a given mass of the other element,  is in a small whole-
number  ratio. For example,  carbon and oxygen  form two compounds:  carbon
monoxide  and carbon dioxide.  Carbon  monoxide  contains  1.3321 g of oxygen
for each | g of carbon,  whereas  carbon dioxide  contains  2.6642 g of oxygen
for each 1g of carbon.  Hence, carbon  dioxide  contains  twice the mass of oxygen
as does carbon  monoxide.
Activity  1.2
Form a group and perform  the following  task. Present  your findings  to the class.
Using two chemical  compounds  as an example,  describe  the difference  between  the law
of definite  proportions  and the law of multiple  proportions.
Dalton  proved  that these laws are entirely  reasonable  if the elements  are composed  of
tiny particles,  which he called atoms. An atom is the smallest  fundamental  particle  of
an element.
The basic postulates  of Dalton’s  Atomic  Theory are summarized  as follows:
1. All elements  are made up of small particles  called atoms.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.Atoms are indivisible  and indestructible.
All atoms of a given element  are identical  in mass and in all other properties.
Atoms are neither  created  nor destroyed  in chemical  reactions.
Compounds  are formed  when atoms of more than one element  combine.
In a given compound,  the relative  numbers  and types of atoms are constant.
srRUCTUREOFTHEATOM
Although  some of these postulates,  like postulate  number  2 and number  3, have been
shown to be incorrect  by later work, Dalton's  theory was a brilliant  and logical
explanation  of many experimental  discoveries  and laws that were known  at that time.
Activity  1.3
Form a group. Discuss the following  laws and present  to the class.
Use Dalton’s  atomic  theory  to explain:
a_ The law of conservation  of mass
b The law of definite  proportions
c_ The law of multiple  proportions.
Towards  the end of the 19th century,  various  experimental  discoveries  revealed  the
existence  of subatomic  particles,  isotopes,  and so on. In light of these findings,
Dalton's  Atomic  Theory  was modified.
The Modern  Atomic  Theory  can be summarized  as follows:
1. Atoms are the smallest  particles  of all elements  that can take part in a chemical
reaction.
2. An atom is divisible.  It can be subdivided  into electrons,  protons,  and neutrons.
An atom is also indestructible  i.e., atoms can neither  be created  nor destroyed
during ordinary  chemical  reactions.
3. Atoms of the same element  may not be identical  in mass because  of the existence
of isotopes.
4. Atoms of the same elements  have identical  chemical  properties.
Atoms of different  elements  have different  chemical  properties.
6. Atoms of two or more elements  combine  in simple  whole-number  ratios to form
compounds.
Exercise  1.1
Name the postulates  of Dalton’s  atomic  theory.
2. Compare  and contrast  Dalton’s  atomic  theory with modern  atomic  theory.

Activity  1.4
Form a group and discuss  the following  ideas. Present  your discussion  to the rest of the
class.
1. In your grade 7 chemistry  lesson, you have learned that atoms consist of three
fundamental  subatomic  particles.  What are these?  Where is their location  in the atoms?
What are their charges?
2. What were the consequences  of the discoveries  of subatomic  particles  on Dalton’s
atomic  theory?
In the late 1880’s, John Dalton  thought  atoms were indivisible.  However,  a series of
investigations  and astounding  discoveries  clearly demonstrated  that atoms are made up
of smaller  particles,  called subatomic  particles.  The three fundamental  subatomic
particles  of an atom are electrons,  protons,  and neutrons.
Do you think that there is a similarity  between  cathode  rays and electrons?
The electron  was the first subatomic  particle  to be identified.  In 1879, William
Crooke studied electrical  discharges  in partially  evacuated  tubes called
discharge  tubes.
Two electrodes  from a high-voltage  source are sealed into a glass tube from which air
has been evacuated.  The negative  electrode  is the cathode  and the positive  one is the
anode. When the high-voltage  current  is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenish
light and a beam of light is seen at the anode. These rays flow from the cathode
towards  the anode in a straight  line. They are called cathode  rays. Later on, in 1897,
J.J. Thomson  found that the beam was deflected  by both electrical  and magnetic
STRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM umm
fields. In an electric  field, they bend toward  the positive  plate. From this he concluded
that the cathode  rays are made up of very small negatively  charged  particles,  which he
named  electrons.  He concluded  that electrons  are constituents  of all matter,  because
he obtained  the same results when he changed  the gas and the electrode  in the tube.

Properties of Cathode  Rays
Cathode  rays possess  the following  properties:
I. An object placed between  the cathode  and the opposite  end of the tube,
casts a shadow  on the glass. This shows that the cathode  rays travel in a
straight  line.
2. A paddle  wheel placed in the path of cathode  rays rotates. This indicates  that
cathode  rays are of particle  nature-the  particles  strike the paddle and therefore
move the wheel.

3. When an electric  or magnetic  field is applied  in the path of cathode  rays, they
are deflected  towards  the positive  plate. This shows that cathode  rays are
negatively  charged.
@ cHemistaveraDES
4. The properties  of cathode  rays (like charge to mass ratio, e-/m ratio) do not
depend  on the nature of the gas in the discharge  tube or on the material  of the
cathode.  This shows that electrons  are present  in the atoms of all elements.
Thus, cathode-ray  experiments  provided  evidence  that atoms are divisible  into small
particles,  and that one of the atom’s basic constituents  is the negatively  charged
particle  called electron.
PROJECT  WORK
Produce  a model  of cathode  ray tube from simple  and locally  available  materials
such as glass tube, copper  wire and rubber  stoppers.  Using  your model  show  how
cathode  rays are generated  and explain  their properties.
Charge  and Mass of an Electron
J.J. Thomson  studied  the deflection  of cathode  rays under the simultaneous  application
of electric and magnetic  fields, that are applied  perpendicular  to each other. His
experiment  led to the precise determination  of the charge-to-mass  ratio (e7/m) of an
electron,  and this ‘e-/m’ value was found to be 1.76 x 10% coulomb/g.  Coulomb  is a
unit of electric  charge.
Activity  1.5
Form a group and discuss  how J.J Thomson's  determination  of the charge-to-mass  ratio of
the electron  led to the conclusion  that atoms were composed  of sub atomic  particles.
Present  your findings  to the class.
In 1909, Robert  Millikan  determined  the charge of an electron  (e-), using the oil drop
experiment.  He found the charge of an electron  to be 1.60 x 10-!° coulombs.
Combination  of e/m and e~ values are used to determine  the mass of an electron,
which is found to be 9.11 < 1073! kg.
From Thomson’s  experiment,  e-/m = 1.76 x 10° C/g
From Millikan’s  experiment,  e~ = 1.60 x 10°! C
Mt the el eo 1.6010"  C
, assof the electron = m = =e/m_ 1.76x10°  C/g
= 911 x 1078 g=9.11 x 103! kg
From the above discussion,  it follows  that:
An electron  is a fundamental  particle  of an atom carrying  a negative  charge and having
a very small mass. The mass of an electron  is approximately  1837 times the mass
of a hydrogen  atom.

Exercise  1.2
1. Explain  how the electron  was discovered.
2. Give explanation  on the works of J.J. Thomson  and R. Millikan.
Radioactivity
In 1895, the German  physicist,  Wilhelm  R6ntgen  noticed  that cathode  rays caused
glass and metals to emit very unusual  rays. This highly energetic  radiation  penetrated
matter, darkened  covered  photographic  plates, and caused  a variety  of substances  to
fluoresce.  Since these rays could not be deflected  by a magnet,  they could not contain
charged  particles  as cathode  rays do. R6ntgen  called them X-rays.
Not long after R6ntgen’s  discovery,  Antoine  Becquerel,  a professor  of physics  in
Paris, began to study fluorescent  properties  of substances.  He found that exposing
thickly  wrapped  photographic  plates to a certain  uranium  compound  caused  them to
darken,  even without  the stimulation  of cathode  rays. Like X-rays,  the rays from the
uranium  compound  were highly energetic  and could not be deflected  by a magnet.
Also, these rays were generated  spontaneously.  One of Becquerel's  students,  Marie
Curie, suggested  the name radioactivity  to describe  this spontaneous  emission  of
particles  and/or radiation.  Consequently,  any element  that spontaneously  emits
radiation  is said to be radioactive.
Further  investigation  revealed  that three types of rays are produced  by the “decay”,  or
breakdown  of radioactive  substances  such as uranium,  polonium,  and radium.  These
are alpha, beta, and gamma  rays.
Alpha () rays consist  of positively  charged  particles  called a-particles.  They are
deflected  by positively  charged  plates. Beta ({) rays or {-particles  are electrons  of
nuclear origin that are deflected  by negatively  charged  plates. The third type of
radioactive  radiation  consists  of high-energy  rays called gamma  (y) rays. Like X-rays,
y-rays have no charge and are not affected  by an external  electric  or magnetic  field.
Activity  1.6
Form a group and discuss  the following  ideas. Present  your discussion  to the class.
Scientists  discovered  the three subatomic  particles  (electrons,  protons  and neutrons).
Compare  and contrast  these fundamental  sub atomic particles  with alpha particles,  beta
particles  and gamma  rays in terms of the nature of the particles.
More details about the structure  of an atom were provided  in 1911 by Ernest
Rutherford  and his associates,  Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.  The scientists
@ cemisteyrave9
bombarded  a thin gold foil with fast moving  alpha particles.  Alpha  particles  are positively
charged  particles  with about four times the mass of a hydrogen  atom. Geiger and
Marsden  assumed  that mass and charge were uniformly  distributed  throughout  the atoms
of the gold foil. Therefore,  they expected  the alpha particles  to pass through  the gold foil
with only a slight deflection.  However,  when the scientists  checked  for the possibility  of
wide-angle  deflections,  they were shocked  to find that roughly 1 in 8000 of the alpha
particles  had actually  been redirected  back toward  the source.
After thinking  about the observations  for two years, Rutherford  finally came up with
an explanation.  He reasoned  that the rebounded  alpha particles must have
experienced  some powerful  force within  the atom. He concluded  that the source of
this force must occupy  a very small amount  of space because  very few of the total
number  of alpha particles  had been affected  by it. He also concluded  that the force
must be caused by a very densely  packed  bundle of matter with a positive  electric
charge. Rutherford  called this small, dense, positrve  bundle of matter  the nucleus.

Rutherford’s  Conclusion
1. Since most of the o-particles  passed  through  the gold foil undeflected,  most of
the space in an atom is empty.
2. Some of the c-particles  were deflected  by small angles. This indicated  the presence
of a heavy  positive  centre in the atom, which  Rutherford  named  the nucleus.
3. Only a few particles  (1 in about a million)  were either deflected  by a very large
angle or deflected  back. This confirmed  that the space occupied  by the heavy
positive  centre must be very small.

of gold metal with alpha particles.
From the angles through  which alpha particles  are deflected,  Rutherford  calculated
that the nucleus  of an atom has a radius of about 10-! m. The radius of the whole
atom is about 10-!° m. Therefore,  the nucleus is about 1/10,000  (one ten-thousandth)
of the size of the atom as a whole. Thus, if we magnified  an atom to the size of a
football  stadium  (about 100 m across),  the nucleus  would be represented  by a pea
placed at the centre of the pitch.
Rutherford  suggested  that the negatively  charged  electrons  surrounding  the positively
charged  nucleus  are like planets around  the sun revolving.  He could not explain,
however,  what kept the electrons  in motion  around  the nucleus.
In 1932, an English  scientist, James Chadwick,  identified  the existence  of neutrons.
He bombarded  a thin foil of beryllium  with o-particles  of a radioactive  substance.  He
then observed  that highly penetrating  rays, consisting  of electrically  neutral particles  of
a mass approximately  equal to that of the proton, were produced.  These neutral
particles  are called neutrons.
A neutron  is a subatomic  particle  carrying  no charge and having a mass of 1.675 x
10-*4 g. This mass is almost equal to that of a proton or of a hydrogen  atom.

59 a.m.u.
Are these findings  in agreement  with Dalton’s  atomic  theory?  Discuss  your conclusions  in
your group.
All atoms have two regions. The nucleus  is a very small region located  at the center of
an atom. Except for the nucleus of the simplest  type of hydrogen  atom, all atomic
nuclei are made of two kinds of particles,  protons and neutrons.  Surrounding  the
nucleus,  there is a region occupied  by negatively  charged  particles  called electrons.
This region is very large compared  with the size of the nucleus.  A proton has a
positive  charge, which is equal in magnitude  to the negative  charge of an electron.
Atoms are electrically  neutral because  they contain  equal numbers  of protons and
electrons.

It is convenient  to think of the region  occupied  by the electrons  as an electron  cloud,
a cloud of negative  charge.  The radius of an atom is the distance  from the center of
the nucleus  to the outer portion  of this electron  cloud. This is about 107!° m = 100
pm = 0.1 nm. Because  atomic  radii are so small, they are expressed  using a unit that
is specifically  convenient  for the sizes of atoms. This unit can be picometer,  nanometer,
micrometer,  etc. The abbreviation  for the
picometer  is pm (1 pm = 107! m = 107! cm)
nanometer  is nm (1 nm = 10° m = 1077 cm)
micrometer  is um (lum = 10° m = 10% cm)

ii) Which of them are negatively  charged?

All atoms are composed  of the same basic particles.  Yet all atoms are not the same.
Atoms of different  elements  have different  number  of protons.  Atoms of the same
element  have the same number  of protons.
The Atomic  Number  (Z) of an element  is equal to the number  of protons in the
nucleus  of an atom. It is also equal to the number  of electrons  in the neutral atom.
Z=p or Z=e (ina natural atom)
For different  elements,  the nuclei of their atoms differ in the number  of protons  they
contain. Therefore,  they differ in the amount  of positive  charge that their atoms
possess.  Thus, the number  of protons  in the nucleus  of an atom determines  the identity
of an atom.
Each atom of an element  is identified  by its atomic  number.  In the periodic  table, the
atomic  number  of an element  is indicated  below its symbol.  Notice  that the elements
are placed in order of increasing  atomic  number.  Hydrogen,  H, has atomic  number  1,
hence, atoms of the element  hydrogen  have one proton in the nucleus.  Next is helium,
He, which has two protons  in its nucleus.  Lithium,  Li, has three protons.  Beryllium,
Be, has four protons,  and so on.
Mass Number  (A) is the sum of the number  of protons  and neutrons  in the nucleus  of
an atom. Collectively,  the protons  and neutrons  of an atom are called its nucleons.
Mass Number  (4) = Number  of protons + Number  of neutrons
The name of an element,  its atomic  number  and mass number  can be represented  by
a shorthand  symbol.  For example,  to represent  neutral atoms of magnesium  with 12
protons and 12 neutrons,  the symbol is Mg. The atomic number is written as a
subscript  to the left of the symbol  of magnesium.  The mass number  is written  as a
superscript  to the left of the symbol.  This method  can be represented  in general  by
the following  illustration,  in which  X stands for any chemical  symbol.
Mass  Number  x or A 4
Z, Atomic Number

Mg can be read as “Magnesium-24”,  and “Magnesium-25”  represents Mg. In a
12 12
23
similar  manner, Na can be read as “Sodium-23”.
The number  of neutrons  in an atom is found by subtracting  the atomic  number  from
the mass number.  For example,  the number  of neutrons  for a silver atom (')SAg) is:
Mass number  — Atomic  number  = Number  of neutrons
108 — 47 = 61
The number  of neutrons  is 61.
Example  1
How many protons,  electrons,  and neutrons  are found in an atom of bromine-80
if its atomic  number  is 35?
Solution:
Atomic  number  of bromine  is 35.
Mass number  of bromine  is already  given as 80. Now we can write bromine,
Br in the form of:
7X as 3Br = Br
Mass number  — Atomic  number  = Number  of neutrons
80 — 35 = 45 neutrons
For a neutral atom: number  of protons  = number  of electrons  = atomic  number.
Number  of protons  = Number  of electrons  = 35

The simplest  atoms are those of hydrogen.  Each hydrogen  atom contains  one proton

Three types of hydrogen  atoms are known. The most common  type of hydrogen  is
called protium.  It accounts  for 99.985%  of the hydrogen  atoms found on Earth. The
nucleus  of a protium  atom consists  of one proton only, and it has one electron  moving
around  it. The second  form of hydrogen  atom is called deuterium,  which accounts  for
0.015%  of the Earth's hydrogen  atoms. Each deuterium  atom has a nucleus  containing

and it is radioactive.  It exists in very small amounts  in nature, but it can be prepared
artificially.  Each trittum atom contains  one proton and two neutrons. Protium,
deuterium  and tritium are the three isotopes  of hydrogen.
Isotopes  are the atoms of the same element  that have the same atomic  number  but different
masses  number.  The isotopes  of a particular  element  have the same number  of protons  and
electrons  but different  number  of neutrons.  Isotopes  of an element  may occur  naturally,  or
they may be made in the laboratory  (artificial  isotopes).  Since isotopes  have the same
number  of protons  and electrons,  they have the same chemical  properties.
Designating  Isotopes
Isotopes  are usually identified  by specifying  their mass number.  There are two
methods  for specifying  isotopes. In the first method,  the mass number  is written
with a hyphen  after the name of the element.  Tritium,  for example,  is written  as
Hydrogen-3.  We will refer to this method  as hyphen  notation.  The second  method  for
@  cHemistaysraDes
designating  an isotope  is by indicating  its isotopic  nuclear  composition.  For example,
Hydrogen-3  is written as *H. The following  table illustrates  this designation  of
isotopes  for hydrogen  and helium.

Relative  Atomic  Masses
Actual  masses  of atoms,  measured  in grams,  are very small. An atom of oxygen-16,
for example,  has a mass of 2.657 x 10-*3g. For most chemical  calculations,  it is more
convenient  to use relative  atomic  masses.  In order to set up a relative  scale of atomic
mass, one atom has been arbitrarily  chosen  as the standard  and assigned  a relative  mass
value. The masses  of all other atoms are expressed  in terms of this defined  standard.
The standard  used by scientists  to determine  units of atomic  mass is the carbon-12
atom. It has been arbitrarily  assigned  a mass of exactly 12 atomic  mass units, or 12
a.m.u. One atomic  mass unit, or | a.m.u, is exactly 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12
atom, or 1.660 x 10°*4 g. The atomic mass of any atom is determined  by
comparing  it with the mass of the carbon-12  atom. The hydrogen-1  atom has an
atomic  mass of about 1/12 of that of the carbon-12  atom, or about 1 a.m.u. The
precise  value of the atomic  mass of a hydrogen-1  atom is 1.007 a.m.u. An oxygen-
16 atom has about 16/12 (or 4/3 the mass of a carbon-12  atom). Careful
measurements  show the atomic  mass of oxygen-16  to be 15.994 a.m.u. The mass
of a magnesium-24  atom is found to be slightly  less than twice that of a carbon-12
atom. Its atomic mass is 23.985 a.m.u.
sre UCTURE OFTHE ATOM
The masses  of subatomic  particles  can also be expressed  on the atomic-mass  scale.
The mass of an electron  is 0.0005486  a.m.u, that of the proton is 1.007276  a.m.u,
and that of the neutron  is 1.008665  a.m.u. Note that the proton and neutron  masses
are close to 1 a.m.u but not equal to 1 a.m.u. You have learned  that the mass number
is the total number  of protons  and neutrons  in the nucleus  of an atom. You can now
see that the mass number  and relative  atomic  mass of a given nucleus  are quite close
to each other. They are not identical  because  the proton and neutron  masses deviate
slightly  from 1 a.m.u.

Average  Atomic  Masses  of Elements
Most elements  occur naturally  as mixtures  of isotopes,  as shown in the examples  in
Table 1.3. The percentage  of each isotope  in the naturally  occurring  elements  is nearly
always  the same, no matter  where the element  is found. The percentage  at which each
isotope  of an element  occurs in nature is taken into account  when calculating  the
average  atomic  mass of the element.  Average  atomic  mass is the weighted  average  of
the atomic  masses  of the naturally  occurring  isotopes  of an element.

The average  atomic  mass of an element  is calculated  by summing  up the products  of

Discuss  the following  concept  in groups  and present  your conclusion  to the class. Have
you heard the word “model”  in your everyday  life? Car makers  produce  different  models  as
time passes.  What is your understanding  about the atomic  model?
Atoms are too small to be observed  directly.  Hence, it is better to develop  a tentative
mental picture (mode!)  of the atomic concept.  The ideas about atoms have changed
mx€
many times. But, at present  we can reduce these ideas into five models:  Dalton’s
Model, Thomson’s  Model, Rutherford’s  Model, Bohr’s Model, and the Quantum
Mechanical  Model.
1) Dalton’s  Atomic  Model
This model of atoms was accepted  for 100 years without  serious challenge.  He
thought  of atoms as solid indestructible  spheres.  He called it the billiard  ball model.
Figure  1.7 Dalton’s  model  of an atom.
ii) Thomson  Model
After learning  that atoms contain  electrons,  Thomson  proposed  a new model of the
atom, which is shown in Figure 1.8. It is sometimes  called the plum-pudding  model. In
his model of an atom, Thomson  proposed  thought  that electrons  were embedded
inside a positively  charged  sphere,  just like plums in a pudding.  Today we might call
Thomson’s  model the chocolate  chip ice-cream  model.

2. What was incorrect  about  Thomson's  model of the atom?
tii) Rutherford  Model
Why was Thomson’s  model of atom discarded  and replaced  by
Rutherford’s  model?
srRUCTUREOFTHEATOM
By 1911, evidence  was collected  that allowed  scientists  to modify  Thomson’s  model
of an atom. Ernest  Rutherford  (1871-1937),  a former  student  of Thomson,  performed
one of the classic experiments  of scientific  history.  As indicated  earlier in this unit, he
bombarded  different  types of matter with high-energy,  positively  charged  alpha
particles.  Based on the Thomson’s  model of an atom, Rutherford  hypothesized  that
the alpha particles  should  go through  very thin metal foils undeflected.  However,  after
performing  an experiment  on gold leaf, he found that a small but significant  number  of
the alpha particles  were deflected  through  large angles by the gold atoms. These
results showed  Rutherford  that the Thomson  model of the atom was not valid. A
uniform  positive  charge with embedded  negatively  charged  electrons  would not
interact  with the alpha particles  in such a manner.
The Rutherford  model of the atom has a small, dense, positively  charged  nucleus
around  which electrons  whirl at high speeds and at relatively  long distances  from it.
He compared  the structure  of an atom with the solar system,  saying  that the nucleus
corresponds  to the sun, while the electrons  correspond  to the planets.  This picture  of
the atom is also called the planetary  atom. In other words, Rutherford  gave us the
nuclear  model of the atom.
Even though  Rutherford  showed  that the atom has a nucleus,  he did not know how
the electrons  were arranged  outside  the nucleus.  This was the major drawback  of
Rutherford’s  model of an atom.
Figure  1.9 Rutherford  model.
A Nobel Prize winner,  Niels Bohr, was known not only for his
own theoretical  work, but also as a mentor  to younger  physicists
who themselves  made important  contributions  to physical
theory.  As the director  of the Institute  for Theoretical  Physics  at
the University  of Copenhagen,  Bohr gathered  together  some of
the finest minds in the physics community,  including  Werner
Heisenberg  and George  Gawow.  During the 1920's,  the Institute
was the source  of many important  works in quantum  mechanics
and in theoretical  physics  in general.
Niels Bohr
md  _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
iv) Bohr Model
In 1913, the Danish  physicist  Niels Bohr (1885-1962)  proposed  an atomic  model in
which the electrons  moved around  the nucleus  in circular  paths called orbits. He
assumed  the electrons  to be moving  around  the nucleus  in a circular  orbit as the
planets  move around  the sun. Based on the Rutherford's  atomic  model, Bohr made
the following  modifications.
¢ The electrons  in an atom can exist only in a restricted  number  of stable orbits
with energy  levels in which they neither  absorb nor emit energy.  These orbits
designated  by a number  called the principal  quantum  number,  n. The principal
quantum  number  has the values of 1, 2, 3, . . . The energy  levels are also called
shells. They are represented  by K, L, M, . . . etc. The K-shell  is the first shell,
the L-shell is the second  shell, the M-shell  is the third shell, etc.
¢ When an electron  moves between  orbits it absorbs  or emits energy. When an
electron  jumps from lower to higher states it absorbs  a fixed amount  of energy.
When an electron  falls from a higher (excited)  state to a lower (ground)  state it
emits a fixed amount  of energy.
¢ The electrons  move around  the nucleus  in energy  levels.
Figure  1.10 The first six energy  levels  in the Bohr model  of an atom.
¢ According  to Bohr, for each element,  the number  of energy  levels or shells is
fixed. Also, each different  energy  level or shell of an atom can only accommodate
a certain  number  of electrons.  The maximum  number  of electrons  that the main
energy  level can have is given by the general  formula  2n’, where n is equal to
the main energy  level.
Therefore,  the maximum  number  of electrons  in each shell in the Bohr model is:
first energy level (n = 1) is 2(1)* =2 electrons
second  energy level (nm = 2) is 2(2)* = 8 electrons
third energy level (n = 3) is 2(3)* = 18 electrons
fourth energy  level (n = 4) is 2(4)* = 32 electrons

It can also be summarized  in the form of Table 1.4.
Table  1.4 Energy  levels  and electrons  for the first four main energy  levels.

L M N
2 8 18 32
¢ When electrons  fill the various  energy  levels in an atom, they first occupy  the
Shell with the lowest  energy  level. When  the lowest  energy  level is filled, according
to the 27° rule, then the electrons  enter the next higher energy level.
The outermost  shell of an atom cannot  accommodate  more than eight electrons,  even
if it has the capacity  to hold more electrons.  This is because  having  more than eight
electrons  in the outermost  shell makes the atom unstable.
For example,  let us write the electron  configuration  of magnesium  that has 12
electrons.  The first 2 electrons  occupy  the K-shell  (the first energy  level). The L-shell
(the second  energy level) is occupied  with 8 electrons.  The remaining  2 electrons
enter the M-shell (the third energy level). Hence, the electron  configuration  of
magnesium  atom becomes  * § %.

During  the 1920’s,  the discovery  of the wave-like  properties  of electrons  led to the
wave-mechanical  model or quantum-mechanical  model of atoms. In this model,  the
electrons  are associated  with definite  energy levels, but their locations  cannot  be
pinpointed.  Instead,  they are described  in terms of the probability  of being found in
certain  regions  of space about the nucleus.  These regions  of space are called orbitals.
An orbital is a particularly  shaped  volume  of space where the probability  of finding  an
electron  is at a maximum.
According  to this model, the electrons  in an atom are in a series of energy  levels or
shells. Each energy level or shell is described  by a number  called the principal
quantum  number,  ”, which is related  to the size of the energy level. The larger the
energy  value of 1, the farther  the electrons  are found from the nucleus.
The quantum  mechanical  model introduces  the concept  of sublevel  for each main
energy level. For atoms of the known  elements,  there are four types of sublevels
designated  by the letters s, p, d, and f The number  of sublevels  within each energy
level or shell is equal to the numerical  value of 7.

6 P 6 (s,p,d,f,g,h) 72
Any orbital can accommodate  a maximum  of two electrons.  Accordingly,
s-sublevel  has only | orbital and can hold a maximum  of 2 electrons,
p-sublevel  has 3 orbitals  and can hold a maximum  of  6 electrons,
d-sublevel  has 5 orbitals  and can hold a maximum  of 10 electrons,  and
J-sublevel  has 7 orbitals  and can hold a maximum  of 14 electrons.
Electron  Configurations
The arrangement  of electrons  in an atom is known  as the electron  configuration  of the
atom. Because  atoms of different  elements  have different  numbers  of electrons,  a
distinct  electronic  configuration  exists for the atoms of each element.  Like all systems
in nature, electrons  in atoms tend to assume arrangements  that have the lowest
possible  energies.  The lowest  energy  arrangement  of the electrons  in an atom is called
the ground state electron  configuration.  A few simple rules, combined  with the
quantum  number  relationships  discussed  below, allow us to determine  these ground-
state electron  configurations.
The quantum  mechanical  model is designated  by the following  notation:  a coefficient
which shows the main energy  level, a letter that denotes  the sublevel  that an electron
occupies,  and a superscript  that shows the number  of electrons  in that particular
sublevel.
The designation  is explained  as follows

For example,  the electron  configuration  of lithium (2 Li) is: 1s?2s'.
This indicates  that there are 2 electrons  in the first s-sublevel  and 1 electron  in the 2TM4
s-sublevel.
The configuration  for sodium  (7 Na) atom is: 1s*2s*2p°3s'.  This indicate  that there
are 2 electrons  in the first s-sublevel,  2 electrons  in the second  s-sublevel,  6 electrons
in the second  p-sublevel,  and | electron  in the third s-sublevel.

Rules Governing  Electron  Configuration
Most  ofthe electronic  configuration  of an atom  can be explained  in terms  ofthe building-up
principle,  or also known  as the Aufbau  principle.  According  to the Aufbau  principle,  an
electron  occupies  the lowest  energy  orbital  available  before  entering  a higher  energy  orbital.
The atomic  orbitals  are filled  in order  of  increasing  energy.  The orbital  with  the lowest  energy
is the 1s orbital.  The 2s orbital  is the next  higher  in energy,  then  the 27 orbitals,  and so on.
Beginning  with  the third  main  energy  level, n=3, the energies  ofthe sublevels  in the different
main  energy  levels  begin  to overlap.
In Figure 1.12, for example,  the 4s sublevel  is lower in energy  than the 3d sublevel.
Therefore,  the 4s orbital  is filled  before  any electrons  enter  the 3d orbitals.  Less energy  is
required  for two electrons  to pair up in the 4s orbital  than for asingle  electron  to occupy  a3d
orbital.  Which  sublevel  will be occupied  after  the 3d sublevel  is fully occupied?
The electrons  are arranged  in sublevels  according  to Aufbau  principle  which  is also known  as
the diagonal  rule. The diagonal  rule is a guide  to the order  of filling  energy  sublevels.  It is
particularly  helpful  for atoms  with  atomicnumbers  higher  than 18. This is because  for atoms
with  higher  atomic  numbers  their  sublevels  are not regularly  filled.SY
Figure  1.12 Diagonal  rule for writing  electron  configuration.
If you list the orbitals  following  the direction  of arrows,  you can obtain the electron
configuration  of most atoms. Therefore,  the order of filling the sublevels  is given as:
1s? 2s* 2p° 3s? 3p° 4s? 3d!° 4p° 5s? 4d!9 Sp® 6s? 4f14 5d) 6p%...
The outermost  occupied  energy  level of an atom is called the valence  shell and the
electrons  that enter into these energy levels are referred  to as valence  electrons.
Example  1
What is the electron  configuration  of magnesium,  * Mg?
Solution:
5 Mg = Is? 2572p° 357 = in sublevelKo
2 8 2 = in main energy level
From this, we can write the configuration  of elements  by using a noble gas as
a core and the electrons  outside  the core. Note that noble gases have complete
outer electron  shells, with 2 or 8 electrons.  Therefore,  the above electron
configuration  can be written  as follows:

Example  2
Write the electron  configuration  of copper  (Z = 29).
Solution:

energy,  until all its electrons  are filled. Therefore,  the configuration  will be:

The Greek philosopher  Democritus  proposed  what we consider  as the first atomic
theory. He believed  that all matter consists  of very small, indivisible  particles.  He
named  the particles  atoms (meaning  uncuttable  or indivisible).
John Dalton’s  work in atomic theory marked  the start of modern  chemistry.  His
concept  of an atom was far more detailed  and specific  than Democritus’.
Dalton did not try to describe  the structure  or composition  of atoms — he did not
know what an atom really looked  like. But he did realize that the different  properties
shown  by elements  such as hydrogen  and oxygen  can be explained  by assuming  that
hydrogen  atoms are not the same as oxygen  atoms.
In our current  view of atomic  theory, atoms consist  of smaller  particles  — electrons,
protons,  and neutrons.  The structure  of an atom is basically  a cloud of electrons
@& cHemistaveraDES
surrounding  a small, dense region, called the nucleus.  An electron  is a negatively
charged  particle  with negligible  mass.
The nucleus  was discovered  by Ernest  Rutherford.  Rutherford  suggested  that the
charge and mass of an atom are concentrated  in its nucleus,  and that the nucleus  has
positive  charge.
In current  views, the nucleus  of an atom contains  protons  and neutrons.  Protons  have
positive  charge,  and neutrons  have no charge. Each element  has a unique  number  of
protons in its atoms. This number  is the atomic number  of the element,  and is
designated  by Z. The total number  of protons  and neutrons  in the nucleus  of an atom
is the mass number  of the element.  Mass number  is designated  by 4. Atomic  number
and mass number  for an atom of an element,  X, is designated  by:
AZé
For a neutral atom,
¢ the number  of protons  = the number  of electrons  = atomic number.
¢ the number  of protons  + the number  of neutrons = mass number.
Over centuries,  scientists  have developed  these main atomic  models:
¢ Dalton’s  Model: an atom is a solid, indestructible  sphere.
¢ Thomson’s  Model: an atom is a sphere with a uniform  positive  charge.  Negatively
charged  electrons  are embedded  in the positive  charge.
¢ Rutherford’s  Model: Rutherford  discovered  that atoms are mostly  empty space
with a dense, positive  nucleus.
¢ Bohr’s  Model: in an atom, electrons  follow circular  orbits around  the nucleus.
The Bohr Model was the first quantum  mechanical  model of the atom.
¢ The Quantum  Mechanical  Model: in an atom, the orbits of electrons  around
the nucleus  are elliptical.  This theory is a modification  of the Bohr model.
The quantum  mechanical  description  of an atom is the electron  configuration  of the
atom — the arrangement  of electrons  in the atom. The maximum  number  of electrons  in
a main energy level is 2n*, where n is the principal  quantum  number.
The quantum  mechanical  model is governed  by this principle:
The Aufbau  principle  is a guide to the order of filling energy levels and sublevels.
According  to this principle  lower energy sub levels are completely  filled before
electrons  enter higher  energy sublevels.

the class.
What was the basis for the early attempts  in classifying  the elements?  Outline  the
contributions  of some scientists  you have read about in classfying  the elements.
Before the beginning  of the 18" century,  it was easy to study and remember  the
properties  of the elements  because  very few were known. However,  in the middle  of
the 19" century,  many more elements  were discovered.  Scientists  then began to
investigate  possibilities  for classifying  the known  elements  in a simple and useful
manner.  After numerous  attempts,  the scientists  were ultimately  successful.  They
grouped  elements  with similar  properties  together.  This arrangement  is known  as the
classification  of elements.
Early Attempts  in classifying  the elements
What is meant by the term periodicity?  Can you give some periodic  events in
nature?
Early attempts  to classify  elements  were based merely  on atomic  mass. Then scientists
began to seek relationships  between  atomic mass and other properties  of the
elements.
i) Dobereiner's  Triads: One of the first attempts  to group similar  elements  was
made in 1817 by the German  chemist  J. Dobereiner.  He put together  similar
elements  in group of three or triads. According  to Dobereiner,  when elements  in
a triad are arranged  in the order of increasing  atomic  masses,  the middle  element
had the average  atomic  mass of the other two elements.  For example,  because
the atomic mass of bromine  is nearly equal to the average atomic mass of
chlorine  and iodine, he considered  these three elements  to constitute  a triad when
arranged  in this order: chlorine,  bromine,  iodine see Table 2.2.

ii) Newlands's  Law of Octaves: In 1864, John Newlands,  an English  chemist,
reported  the law of octave,  which is also known  as the law of eight. He stated
that when elements  are arranged  in increasing  order of their atomic masses,
every eighth element  had similar  properties  to the first element.
Newlands  first two octaves of eight elements  are shown below:

While attempting  to group the elements  according  to their
chemical  properties  and atomic weights,  Dimitri Mendeleev
developed  the periodic  table and formulated  the periodic  law.
Because  his classification  revealed  recurring  patterns  (periods)  in
the elements,  Mendeleev  was able to leave spaces in his table for
elements  that he correctly  predicted  would be discovered.

(2.2.1 The Periodic  Law
A. Mendeleev’s  Periodic  Law
In 1869, the Russian  chemist  Dimitri  Mendeleev  and the German  scientist  Luthar
Meyer independently  published  periodic  arrangements  of the elements  based on
increasing  atomic  mass.
Mendeleev  observed  that, when elements  are arranged  according  to increasing  atomic
mass, the chemical  and physical  properties  of the elements  recur at regular  intervals.
This periodic  variation  and the recurrence  of the properties  of the elements  led to the
formulation  of the Periodic  Law.
Mendeleev's  periodic  law states that the properties  of the elements  are periodic
functions  of their atomic masses.  Only 63 elements  were known  when Mendeleev
constructed  his table in 1871. Mendeleev  organized  his table in columns,  with each
column containing  elements  that have similar chemical  properties.  Accordingly,
elements  in the same column  gave family or groups of elements.
How did Mendeleev  know where to leave gaps  for undiscovered  elements  in his
periodic  table?
Mendeleev  left blank spaces for the undiscovered  elements  and also predicted  masses
and other properties  of these unknown  elements  almost correctly. For example,
neither  gallium  nor germanium  were discovered  when Mendeleev  constructed  his
periodic  table. But he predicted  the existence  and properties  of these unknown
elements.
Mendeleev  left two blank spaces for these two elements  in the table, just under
aluminium  and silicon. He called these unknown  elements  'eka-aluminium'  and 'eka-
silicon."  (‘eka' means 'first'). What he meant  by 'eka-aluminium'  is "a currently  known
element  (galium)  following  aluminium".
Later on, in 1874, the element  Gallium  (eka-aluminium  in Mendeleev's  system)  was
discovered.  In 1886, the element  Germanium  (eka-silicon)  was discovered.  The
observed  properties  of these elements  were remarkably  very close to those in
Mendeleev’s  predictions.  Table 2.3 shows the properties  of eka-silicon  predicted  by
Mendeleev  and compares  them to the observed  properties  of Germanium.

Defects  in Mendeleev's  periodic  table
1. Position  of isotopes:  The isotopes  were not given separate  places in Mendeleev's
periodic  table. Since elements  are arranged  in order of increasing  atomic  masses,
the isotopes  belong  to different  groups (because  isotopes  have different  masses).
2. Wrong  order of atomic  masses of some elements:  When certain  elements  are
grouped  on the basis of their chemical  properties,  some elements  with higher
atomic  masses  precede  those with lower atomic  masses. For example,  argon,
with atomic  mass of 39.95, precedes  potassium  with atomic  mass of 39.1.
B The Modern  Periodic  Law
What was Mosley's  contribution  to the modern  form of the Periodic  Table?
In 1913, the English  physicist  Henry Mosley  determined  the atomic  number  of each of
the elements  by analyzing  their X-ray spectra.  He observed  that when each element
was used as a target in an X-ray tube, it gave out X-rays with a characteristic
wavelength.  The wavelength  depends  on the number  of protons  in the nucleus  of the
atom and was constant  for a given element.  By arranging  the elements  in order of
decreasing  wavelength,  Mosley  was able to assign atomic  number  to each element.
The atomic  number  of every element  is fixed, and it clearly distinguishes  one element
from another. 'No two elements  can have the same atomic  number.'  For example,
atomic  number  8 identifies  the element  oxygen.  No other element  can have atomic
number  8.
@ cHemistaveraDES
Therefore,  the atomic number of an element is the fundamental  property  that
determines  the chemical  behavior  of the element. The discovery  of atomic  number  led
to the development  of the modern  periodic  law. The modern  periodic  law states that:
“the properties  of the elements  are periodic  function  of their atomic numbers.”  This
means that when elements  are arranged  according  to increasing  atomic number,
elements  with similar  physical  and chemical  properties  fall in the same group.
Many different  forms of the periodic  table have been published  since Mendeleev's
time. Today, the long form of the periodic  table, which is called the modern  periodic
table, is commonly  in use. It is based on the modern  periodic  law. In the modern
periodic  table, elements  are arranged  in periods  and groups.
What are the basis  for classifying  the elements  into groups  and  periods?
What are the similarities  and differences  in the electron  configuration  of S
and Cl?
Periods: The horizontal  rows of elements  in the periodic  table are called periods  or
series.
Elements  in a period are arranged  in increasing  order of their atomic  numbers  from left
to right.
There are 7 periods  in the modern  periodic  table, and each period is represented  by
an Arabic  numeral:  1, 2... and 7.
e Elements  in the same period have the same number  of shells.
¢ Periods 1, 2, and 3 are called short periods while periods 4, 5, and 6 are
known  as long periods.
¢ Period | contains  only 2 elements,  hydrogen  and helium.  Period  2 and period 3

¢ Period  4 and period 5 contain 18 elements  each. Period 6, the longest  period,
has 32 elements.  Period 7, which is an incomplete  period, contains  more than
24 elements.Period  7 element  is radioactive  and/or an artificial  element.
¢ Except  for the first period, all periods  start with an alkali metal and ends with a

and so on
The position  of an element  in a given period can be determined  by the number  of
shells occupied  with its electrons.  Accordingly,  the number  of shell is equal to the
number  of period to which the element  belongs.
Example
Electronic  configuration  of 73Na = 1s°2s’2p%3s!  (2, 8, 1). Sodium  has 3 main
shells. Hence, sodium  is found in period 3.
What are the similarities  and differences  in the electron configuration  of F
and Cl?
Groups  or families:  are the vertical columns  of elements  in the periodic  table. There
are 18 columns  or groups in the modern  periodic  table.
¢ Group numbers  are usually designated  with the Roman  numerals  I to VIII each
followed  by the letter A or B.
These are: IA... 2. ee. VIII A Main groups (A groups)
IB... 2... VIIIB Sub groups (B groups)
¢ Elements  in a given group have the same number  of outermost  shell electrons.
¢ Elements  in the same group have similar chemical  properties.
¢ For the main group elements  the group number  equals the number  of valence
electrons.
Example
Electronic  configuration  of 7?Cl = 1s?2s?2p°3s?3p°  (2, 8, 7). The number  of
valence  electrons  of chlorine  is 7. Hence chlorine  is found in Group VIIA.

Elements  in a periodic  table can be classified  into three distinct  categories  based on
their electron  configuration  and the type of sub-level  being filled. These are the
representative  elements,  the transition  elements,  and the rare-earth  elements.
1. Representative  Elements:  s-and  p-block  elements
These are elements  in which valence electrons  are filling the s- or p-orbitals.
Representative  elements  are also known as Main Group Elements.  They include
elements  in groups IA through  VIIA.
s-block  elements  are elements  in which the last electron  enters the s-orbital  of the
outermost  shell. Their general  valence shell configuration  is ms' and ns’, where n
represents  the outermost  shell. They are found on the left side of the periodic  table
@ cremistevcraves
and contain  the first two groups: Group IA and Group IIA. These two groups
contain  very reactive  metals.
p-block  Elements  are elements  in which the last electron  enters the p-orbital  of the
outermost  shell. They have the general  valence  shell electron  configuration  of ns*np'—
ns-np®.  p-block  elements  are located  at the right hand side of the periodic  table and
they include  six groups-Group  IIIA to VIIIA. Most of these elements  are non-metals.

representative  elements.

Why is helium  classified  as a noble gas?
2. Transition  Elements:  d-block  elements
These elements  are found in the periodic  table between  the s-block  and p-block
elements.  In these elements,  the valence  electrons  are being added to the d-orbital  of
the outermost  shell. They are also known  as d-block  elements. They are designated
as 'B' group, and they consist  of groups  IB — VIIIB. The transition  elements  are found
in periods  4, 5, 6, and 7. They include  common  elements  such as iron, gold, and
copper. d-block  elements  are also called transition  metals.
3. Rare-Earth  Elements:  f-block  elements
These elements  are also known  as inner-transition  elements. They are elements  in
which the last electrons  are being added to the forbital  of the outermost  shell. The
inner transition  elements  are in periods  6 and 7. The period 6 inner transition  series
fills the 4forbitals.  It is known  as the Lanthanide  series because  it occurs after the
element  lanthanum  and its elements  are similar  to it. The period 7 inner transition
series fills the 5/orbitals  and appears  after the element  actinium.  Its elements  are
similar  to actinium,  thus it is known  as the Actinide  series.
Figure 2.1 presents  a scheme  to show the basic structure  of the periodic  table. On the
basis of the electron  configuration  of the elements  the table is divided  into s, p, d and
f-blocks.

¢ explain  the general  trends in properties  of elements  across a period;
¢ deduce  the properties  of an element  from its position  in the periodic  table; and
¢ make a chart to show the trends in properties  of elements  in the periodic  table.
Activity  2.4
Refer any chemistry  book and look up values for atomic size, ionization  energy,
electronegativity  and other properties  of elements.  Enter the values in the periodic  table,
and see if there any obvious  trends in the properties  as you go across a period or down a
column  of the table. Report  your findings  to the class.
In the periodic  table the properties  of the elements  such as atomic size, ionization
energy,  electron  affinity,  and electronegativity  show  a regular  variation  with in a group
or across a period.
Elements  in the same group have the same number  of valence  electrons  and also
exhibit  similar  chemical  properties.  For example,  group IA elements  have 1 valence
electron;  those in Group IIA have 2 valence  electrons,  and so on. Generally,  it is
possible  to conclude  that the number  of valence electrons  determines  the group
number  of an element.

The periodic  properties  of the elements  can be explained  on the basis of nuclear
charge and effective  nuclear  charge.
Nuclear  charge  (Z): is the total positive  charge in the nucleus  of an atom.
Effective  Nuclear  charge (Z,,): In an atom, the outermost  shell electrons  (or
valence  electrons)  are attracted  to the nucleus  and simultaneously  repelled  by the inner
shell electrons.  The attraction  of the nucleus  for the valence  electrons  is also reduced
because  inner electrons  shield (or screen)  the valence  electrons.  As a result, these
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION  OF THEELEMENTS  —
inner electrons  reduce the attraction  of the nuclear  charge. The resulting  net-positive
nuclear  charge attracting  the valence  electrons  is called effective  nuclear  charge,  Z.,..
Effective  nuclear  charge relates the nuclear  charge to the number  of shells (size) of the
atom.
The effective  nuclear  charge is the difference  between  the nuclear  charge (Z) and the
inner electrons  (S) that shield the valence  electrons.  The effective  nuclear  charge is
always less than the actual nuclear  charge.
Zo = ZS
Let us consider  the sodium  atom with its 11 electrons:  1s72s’2p°3s'  (2, 8, 1). The 10
inner electrons  of sodium  completely  cancel the 10 units of nuclear  charge on the
nucleus.  In this way, the inner electrons  shield the valence  electrons  from the full
attractive  force of the nucleus  and leave an effective  nuclear  charge of + 1 (Z,,.=+  1).
The fact that the inner electrons  shield or screen the outer electrons  from the full
charge of the nucleus  is known  as shielding  or screening  effect.
Activity  2.5
Form a group and perform  the following  task:
Draw Bohr's model for the following  elements  and indicate  the shielding  shells, shielding
electrons  and effective  nuclear  charge:
a beryllium,  magnesium  and calcium;
b lithium,  carbon  and fluorine.
Present  your findings  to the class.
The following  properties  of elements  vary in a regular  periodic  manner.
1. Nuclear  Charge
On moving  down  a given group of the periodic  table, nuclear  charge progressively
increases,  but effective  nuclear  charge remains  nearly constant.
2. Atomic  Size/Atomic  Radius
Where in a group do you find atoms with the largest  atomic radius? Why?
It is difficult  to measure  the size of an atom directly.  The electron  cloud enveloping  the
nucleus does not have a clear boundary  because  its electrons  do not have fixed
distances  from the nucleus.  Therefore,  atoms do not have definite  outer boundaries.
The size of an atom is defined  in terms of its atomic  radius. For metals, atomic  radius
is defined  as one-half  the distance  between  the nuclei of the two adjacent  atoms. For
@ cHemistaveraDES
elements  that exist as diatomic  molecules  (such as chlorine),  atomic  radius is equal to
one-half  of the distance  between  the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule.  Figure 2.2
illustrates  the atomic  radius of chlorine  in a chlorine  molecule.
Chlorine

Distance  between nucleus

In moving  down a group, atomic radius of the elements  mainly depends  on the
number  of shells.

radii corresponding  to the symbols  of the elements.
2. explain  the reason  for the observed  trend.

3. Ionization  Energy
In which region of the periodic  table do you find elements  with the:
a lowest tendency  to lose electrons,  and
b highest  tendency  to lose electrons?
Ionization  energy is the minimum  energy required  to remove  the outermost  shell
electron  from an isolated  gaseous  atom or ion.
ERIODIC CLASSIFICATION  OFTHEELEMENTS  —
Ionization  energy is represented  by the following  equation  (where M denotes  any
metal).
M (g) + energy ——> M* (g) +&
The electrons  in an atom can be successively  removed,  one after another.  Thus, the
first ionization  energy is the energy  needed  to remove  the first valence  electron,  the
second  ionization  energy is the energy  needed  to remove  the second  valence  electron,
and so on.
M (g) + energy  ——>  M?* (g) + & => First ionization  energy
M* (g) + energy  ——> M** (g) +e == Second  ionization  energy
For a given element,  the second  ionization  energy is higher  than the first one.
Ionization  energy is always  a positive  value (and therefore  is an endothermic  process)
because  energy is required  to remove  an electron  from an atom. Ionization  energy is
measured  in electron  volts (eV) or kiloJoules  per mole (kJ/mol).
Ionization  energy  is a measure  of the tendency  of an atom to lose an electron.  Metals
easily lose electrons  and thus have low ionization  energy. Non-metals  have high
ionization  energy  because  they do not easily lose electrons.
Activity  2.7
Form a group and perform  the following  task. Present  your findings  to the class.
Rank each set of the following  elements  in order of decreasing  ionization  energy  and
explain  the trend in ionization  energy  of the elements  down a group.
i) Ca, Sr, Mg, Be
ii) K, Li, Rb, Na
iii) Cl, F, |, Br
Generally,  ionization  energy is affected  by the following  factors:
i) Atomic  size: As atomic size increases,  the valence  electrons  are less tightly
held by the nucleus.  Thus, less energy is required  to remove  these electrons.
For example,  the energy  needed  to remove  an electron  from a cesium  atom is
lower than from  a lithium  atom.
ii) Effective  nuclear  charge: The smaller  the effective  nuclear  charge of an atom,
the lower is the energy  needed  to remove  an electron  from the atom.
iii) Types of electrons:  The closer an electron  is to the nucleus,  the more difficult
it is to remove  the electron.  In a given energy level, s-electrons  are closer to
@ cHemistaveraDES
the nucleus  than p-electrons.  Similarly,  p-electrons  are closer than d-electrons,
and d-electrons  are closer than /electrons.  Hence, ionization  energy
decreases  in the order of: s>p>d>f
Screening  effect by the inner electrons:  As described  earlier, inner shell
electrons  shield the valence  electrons  from the nuclear  charge. The more inner
electrons  there are, the higher  the screening  effect, and therefore  the easier it
is to remove  the valence  electrons.  Screening  decreases  ionization  energy.
Electron  configuration  (stability):  It is easier to remove  electrons  from unstable
sublevels  than from stable ones. Half-filled  (p°*, @, £7) and completely-filled
(d'°, p°®, f') sublevels  are more stable. For example,  more energy is
required  to remove  ap’ electron  than a p’ electron.  As a result of it, the first
ionization  energy  of nitrogen  is higher  than that of oxygen.
Generally,  with the increasing  atomic  number,  the first ionization  energy  decreases
down the same group.
Activity  2.8
After studying  the given information,  identify  the elements  represented  by X, M, and Y;
discuss  the findings  in your group,  and then share your conclusion  with the other groups.
Element  X
Element  M

¢ has a very low ionization  energy.
¢ is in the fourth period of the periodic  table.
* is a transition  element.
* is used in Ethiopian  coinage.
¢ has 10 electrons  in the 3d orbital
4, Electron  Affinity  (E,)
To which group it is easier to add electrons;  alkali metals or halogens?
Non-metals  gain electrons  and therefore  form negative  ions. The tendency  of an atom
to form a negative  ion is expressed  in terms of electron  affinity  (£,).
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION  OF THEELEMENTS  —
Electron  affinity  is defined  as the energy  released  in kilojoules/mole,  when an electron
is added to an isolated  gaseous  atom to form a gaseous  ion. It is a measure  of the
attraction  or ‘affinity’  of the atom for the extra added electron.
X(g) + e ——  X (g) + energy
Since energy is liberated  during the process,  electron  affinity is expressed  as a
negative  value. For example,  when an electron  is added to a fluorine  (F) atom, 328
kJ/mol of energy is released  to produce  a fluoride  ion (F°), and E, is — 328 kJ/mol.
F(g) + © ——>  F (g) + E, =— 328 kJ/mol
Electron  affinity is a measure  of the strength  of an atom to attract an additional
electron.  The smaller  is the atomic size of an element,  the stronger  is the tendency  to
form negative  ions, and consequently  the higher the electron  affinity. Generally,
electron  affinity  depends  on atomic size and effective  nuclear  charge of the elements.
Activity  2.9
Form a group and discuss  the following  concepts.
1. Why does the electron  affinity  of Cl is higher  than that of F?
2. Explain  why noble gases have extremely  low (almost  zero) electron  affinities?
3. Explain  why halogens  have the highest  electron  affinities?
Present  your findings  to the class.
5. Electronegativity
Where do you find the most electronegative  element  in the periodic  table?
Electronegativity  is the ability of an atom in a molecule  to attract  the shared electrons
in the chemical  bond. The American  chemist  Linus Pauling  (1901-1994)  developed
the most widely  used scale of electronegativity  values based on bond strength.  The
Pauling  scale ranges from 0.7 to 4.0. Fluorine,  the most electronegative  element,  is
assigned  a value of 4.0, and the least electronegative  element,  cesium, has an
electronegativity  value of 0.7. The electronegativity  values for all the rest elements  lie
between  these extremes.
The electronegativity  of an atom is related  to its ionization  energy and electron  affinity.
@ cHemistaveraDES
An atom with high ionization  energy and high electron  affinity  also tends to have a high
electronegativity  value because  of its strong attraction  for electrons  in a chemical
bond.
Activity  2.10
Form a group and perform  the following  task:
Arrange  each set of the given elements  in order of decreasing  electronegativity  and
explain  the observed  trend.
a Ba, Mg, Be, Ca
b C, Pb, Ge, Si
Cc Cl, F, |, Br
Present  your findings  to the class.
6. Metallic  Character
In which region of the periodic  table do you find metals and non-metals?
Metals  have the tendency  to lose electrons  and form positive  ions. As a result, metals
are called electropositive  elements.
In moving  down  a group, atomic size increases  progressively,  and it becomes  easier
for elements  to lose their valence  electrons  and form positive  ions. Therefore,  metallic
character  increases  down a group.
In the periodic  table, metals and non-metals  are separated  by a stair step diagonal
line, and elements  near this border  line are called metalloids.  Metals are found on the
left side of the line and nonmetals  on its right side.
Activity  2.11

Form a group and draw a rough sketch of the periodic  table (no details  are required).  Based
on this, perform  the following  activities  and present  your findings  to the class.
1. Indicate  the regions  where metals, non-metals,  and metalloids  are located in the
periodic  table. (Use different  colours).
2. Where  do you find the most active metal and the most active non-metal?  .
As we move from left to right across a period,  the number  of valence  electrons  of the
elements  increases. But the number  of energy  levels or main shells remains  the same
in a given period and electrons  are filling the same energy  level until stable noble gas
configuration  is achieved.  The additional  electrons  from Li (2, 1) to Ne (2, 8) are
added to the second  shell. In fact, the period number  equals the number  of energy
level being filled.

Let us now consider  periodic  properties  of elements  across a period.
1. Atomic  Size: From left to right in a given period, nuclear  charge or atomic
number  progressively  increases  by one for every succeeding  element.  However,
increasing  number  of valence  electrons  is being added to the same shell. This
results in an increase  in effective  nuclear  charge.
Activity  2.13
Form a group and perform  the following  task. Present  your findings  to the class.
The following  values are given for atomic radii (in A) of period 2 elements:

the period from Na to Ar.
Explain  why the first ionization  energy  of:
i) aluminium  is lower than that of magnesium.
ii) sulphur  is lower than that of phosphorus.
(Hint: Use sublevel  configurations  for the elements).
Electron  Affinity:  The variation  in electron  affinity  of elements  in the same
period is due to changes  in nuclear  charge and atomic size of the elements.
A cross a period from left to right, electron  affinity  increases  due to an increase
in effective  nuclear  charge. The elements  show  a greater  attraction  for an extra
added electron.
Electronegativity:  Across a period, a gradual  change in nuclear  charge and
atomic size determine  the trends in the electronegativity  of the elements.

Based on the information  given;
Draw a table of period 3 elements  and fill with the appropriate  electronegativity
values corresponding  to the symbols  of the elements.
Explain  the reason for the observed  trend.
5.Metallic  character:  From left to right in a period, metallic  character  of the
elements  decreases.  Elements  on the left end of a period  have a higher  tendency
to form positive  ions. Those at the right end have a greater  tendency  to form
negative  ions. In any period, elements  on the left side are metals and those on
the right side are nonmetals.
Consider  the following  period-3  elements  and observe  how the elements  become
more non-metallic  on moving  from left to right in the periodic  table:

Activity  2.16
Form a group and discuss  the importance  of the periodic  table for predicting  the atomic
size and ionization  energy  of the elements.  Share your idea with the class.
Why do we need the classification  of elements?
The main advantages  of using the periodic  table are:
1. The periodic  table is useful for predicting  the formulas  of compounds.  The
elements  in a given group form compounds  with the same atomic ratio
@ cHemistayeraDes
because  of their similar  electron  configuration.  For example,  if the chemical
formula  of sodium  oxide is Na,O, then we can predict  the formulas  of the
other oxides of alkali metals. These are Li,O, K,O, Rb,O, and Cs,O.
2. The periodic  table is useful for predicting  the physical  and chemical  properties
of elements.  For example,  radium is a rare and radioactive  element  and
therefore  difficult  to handle in many experiments.  Since its properties  can be
predicted  from the general  trends of group IIA elements,  sometimes  we do
not need to analyze  it directly.
3. The periodic  table is also useful for predicting  the behaviour  of many
compounds.  For example,  oxides of the elements  become  more acidic across
a period and more basic in character  down a group. The trends in the oxides
of period-3  elements  vary from strongly  basic oxides to amphoteric  and then
acidic oxides as we move across  a period.

How do you account  for the unexpected  resemblance  of the properties  of
the following  sets of elements:  Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si?
In addition  to the group and period  relationships,  the elements  of s and p block
also exhibit  diagonal  relationship.  On moving  diagonally  across the periodic  table, the
elements  show certain similarities.  Though  clear upon examination,  these diagonal
relationships  are far less pronounced  than the similarities  within a group.
Diagonal  relationship  is particularly  noticeable  in the elements  of second  and third
periods  of the periodic  table. The following  illustrations  show the diagonal  relationship
between  Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si.

Early attempts  of classification  of the elements  were made by Dobereiner  and
Newlands.
Mendeleev’s  law states that properties  of the elements  are periodic  functions  of
their atomic  masses.
Mendeleev  arranged  the elements  based on increasing  atomic  mass.
Modern  periodic  law states that the properties  of the elements  are periodic
function  of their atomic  numbers.
Periods  are horizontal  rows, and groups are vertical  columns  of the elements  in
the periodic  table.
Elements  in the same group show similar  chemical  properties.
Elements  are classified  as representative,  transition,  and rare-earth  elements.
This classification  is based on the type of sub-level  (s, p, d, or /) being filled.
Ionization  energy is the energy  required  to remove  the outermost  shell electron
from an isolated  gaseous  atom.
Electron  affinity  of an element  is the energy  released  when an electron  is added
to an isolated  gaseous  atom to form a gaseous  ion.
Metallic  character  is the tendency  to lose electrons  and form positively  charged
ions.
Electronegativity  of an element  1s its ability to attract electrons.
Trends in atomic size determine  the trends in ionization  energy,  electron  affinity,
electronegativity,  and metallic  character  of the elements  in the periodic  table.
Atomic  size itself is determined  by the number  of energy  levels, nuclear  charge,
and effective  nuclear  charge.
Periodic  properties  of elements,  such as ionization  energy,  electron  affinity,
electronegativity,  etc. show regular  variation  within a group or period.

Objective  of the Activity
Scientists  have identified  different  types of attractive  forces between  atoms in forming
bonds. The strength  of the forces relies on the types of bonds. For instance,  in
covalent  bonds, the strength  of the bonds depends  on whether  the bonds are
single, double or triple bonds.
In this activity,  you will use bundles  of sticks to develop  your ideas about strength
of bonds.

Activity  3.1
Most of the elements  are not found free in nature. Why do the elements  exists in
combined  form ? Discuss  in group and present  your findings  to the class.
A chemical  bond is the attractive  force that binds atoms together  in a molecule,  or a
crystal lattice.
After the periodic  table and the concept  of electron  configuration  were developed,
scientists  began to develop ideas about molecules  and compounds.  In 1916,
GN Lewis concluded  that atoms combine  in order to achieve  a more stable electron
configuration  resulting  in molecules  or compounds.
Gilbert  Newton  Lewis (1875 - 1946), introduced  the theory  of the
shared-electron-pair  chemical-bond  formation  in a paper
published  in the journal of the American  chemical  society. In
honor of this contribution,  we sometimes  refer to “electron-dot”
structures  as “Lewis  structures”
G.N. Lewis

As independent  particles,  atoms are at relatively  high potential  energy. Nature,  favors
arrangements  in which potential  energy is minimized.  Most individual  atoms exist in a
less stable state than in their combined  form.
When atoms form bonds with each other, they attain lower potential  energy states.
This decrease  in atomic energy generally  results in a more stable arrangement  of matter.
When atoms interact  to form a chemical  bond, only their outer regions  are in contact.
In the process  of the interaction,  atoms achieve  stable outermost  shell configuration.
For this reason, when we study chemical  bonding,  we are concerned  primarily  with
the valence  electrons.  As described  in Unit 2, valence  electrons  are electrons  that exist
in the outermost  shell of an atom.
Activity  3.2
Form a group and discuss  the following:
The following  table shows elements  of group  VIIIA and their atomic numbers.  In the space
provided  fill the valence  shell electron  configuration  and number  of valence  electrons  for
the elements.  In your discussion  include  why helium is placed in group VIIIA even though
it has only 2 valence  electrons.

Helium, He 2
Neon, Ne 10
Argon, Ar 18
Krypton,  Kr 36
Xenon, Xe 54
Radon, Rn 86
Share your discussion  with the rest of the class.
Noble gas atoms with eight electrons  (except  for, He) in the outermost  shell are stable.
Thus, the ns*np° electronic  valence  structure  has maximum  stability. Atoms containing
less than eight electrons  in their outermost  shell are unstable. To attain stability,  these
atoms tend to have eight electrons  in their valence  shells. This leads to the explanation
of the octet rule. The rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose or share electrons  until
there are eight electrons  in their valence  shell.
The type or characteristic  of the resulting  arrangement  depends  largely  on the type of
chemical  bonding  that exists between  the atoms. These are ionic, covalent,  and metallic
bonds.

Activity  3.3
Form a group and discuss  each of the following  concepts.  Share your ideas with the class.
1. Why do some atoms easily lose electrons  and others do not?
2. Sodium chloride,  NaCl is a good conductor  in the form of liquid state, but a non
conductor  in the form of solid state.
When an atom either loses or gains electrons,  it becomes  an ion. An ion is an electrically
charged  particles.  Two different  types of ions exist. These are the positive  ions called
cations and the negative  ions called anions.
The chemical  properties  of metals differ from those of non-metals.  A metal has 1, 2,
or 3 electrons  in its outermost  shell. Metals  tend to lose these electrons  and become
positively  charged  ions. For example,  if a metal (M) loses one electron,  it becomes  an
ion with a charge of +1.
mx€
However,  if it loses two electrons  it becomes  an ion with a charge of +2:
A non-metal  may have 4, 5, 6, or 7 electrons  in its outermost  shell. Non-metals  tend
to gain electrons  to form negatively  charged  ions. For example,  if a non-metal  (X)
gains one electron,  it becomes  an ion with a charge of —1.
Note that hydrogen  can form both a cation, H* (Aydrogen  ion) as in HCl, or an anion
H” (hydride  ion) as in NaH.
Metals in Group IA, the alkali metals,  tend to lose one electron  when they combine
with other elements,  producing  cations of +1 charge. For example,  Na and K each
lose one electron  to form ions of +1 charge.
Na > Na* + e
sodium  atom sodium  ion
K > Kt + e
potassium  atom potassium  ion
On the other hand, Group VIIA elements,  the halogens,  usually  gain one electron  and
produce  an ion with —1 charge. For example,  each Cl and Br atom accepts one
electron  to produce  an ion with —1 charge.
Cl + @& — Cl-
chlorine  atom chloride  ion
Br + @& > Br
bromine  atom bromide  ion
Form a group and perform  the following  tasks:
Consider  the elements:

Tonic Bond  formation
When two atoms combine,  one of the atoms gains electrons  and becomes  an anion
and the other loses electrons  to form a cation. When  a cation and an anion are brought
close to one another,  an electrostatic  force of attraction  is set up between  them. This
force of attraction  between  oppositely  charged  ions is called an ionic bond. It is also
called an electrovalent  bond. The bond is produced  when electrons  are transferred
from the outermost  shell of a metal atom to the outermost  shell of a nonmetal  atom.
To illustrate  ionic bonding,  let us consider  the formation  of the bond between  sodium
and chlorine. A sodium  atom has | valence  electron.  In order to attain the electron
configuration  of the nearest  noble gas (Ne), it has to lose its valence  electron  and
form a sodium  ion (Na‘). Chlorine  has 7 valence  electrons.  By gaining | electron,
chlorine  attains the electron  configuration  of argon (Ar) and form a chloride  ion (CI).
mx
In general,  an ionic bond is formed  by the transfer  of electron  from a metal to a
nonmetal-  for example,  sodium  and chlorine.  Atoms  that are bound  together  by an
ionic bond form ionic compounds.  For example,  Na’ and Cl ions form sodium
chloride,  NaCl. The transfer  of an electron  from sodium  to chlorine  and the formation
of the ionic bond in sodium  chloride  is shown  with the following  shell diagrams.

Electron-dot  notation is often used to represent  the outermost  shell electron
configurations  of the elements.  These formulas,  also called Lewis formulas,  consist  of
the symbol  of the element  plus dots equal to the number  of valence  electrons  in the
atom or ion. Since valence  shells contain a maximum  of eight electrons,  electron-dot
symbols  contain  a maximum  of eight dots. Electron-dot  formulas  of sodium  and chlorine

Many molecules  are formed  when outermost  shell or valence  electrons  are shared
between  two atoms. This sharing  of electrons  creates a covalent  bond.
Covalent  bond formation  can be illustrated  by the sharing  of electrons  between  two
hydrogen  atoms to form a molecule  of hydrogen.

and the two negatively  charged  electrons  hold the atoms in the molecule  together.  This
mm
attractive  force between  positively  charged  nuclei of atoms and the shared electrons  in
a molecule  is known  as covalent  bond.
A molecule  of hydrogen  chloride  is also formed  by a pair of electrons  shared  between
the two atoms. Each atom in the molecule  attains a stable electron  configuration.

Chlorine  atom Hydrogen  Chloride
Figure  3.7 Hydrogen  and chlorine  share a pair of electrons  in HCI.
The concept  of Lewis formula  representation  can also be extended  to covalent  bonds.
The Lewis structure  for a covalent  compound  shows the arrangement  of atoms in a
molecule  and all the valence  electrons  for the atoms involved  in the compound.  It is
conventional  to represent  the non-bonding  (lone pair) electrons  by dots and the pair
of electrons  that are shared between  atoms by a dash. For example,  consider  the
hydrogen  molecule:
The electron-dot  formula  of the hydrogen  molecule  is:
He + eH + H8H
The covalent  bond in hydrogen  molecule  is also written  as H — H.
The formation  of the covalent  bond in hydrogen  chloride  is shown  by the following
electron-dot  formula.  This formula  must satisfy the octet rule (for chlorine)  and the
doublet  rule (for hydrogen).  As shown  in the illustration,  these requirements  are satisfied.
The shared  pair belongs  to both of the atoms (hydrogen  and chlorine)  in the hydrogen
chloride  molecule.  The resulting  valence  electron  configuration  provides  two valence
electrons  to hydrogen  and eight to chlorine.
The chlorine  atom in the molecule  has three pairs of electrons,  which are not used for
bonding.  Pairs of electrons  that is not used for bonding  are called lone-pair  electrons.
Pairs that are used for bonding  are called bonding-pair  electrons.

Consider  the fluorine  molecule,  F,. The electron  configuration  of fluorine  is 2, 7. Thus
each fluorine  atom has seven valence  electrons.  Accordingly,  there is only one unpaired
electron  on fluorine.  Therefore,  the formation  of the fluorine  molecule  is represented  as

Lone pairs sF 3 Fs
!
Bond pairLone pairs
Note that only two valence  electrons  participate  in the formation  of fluorine  molecule.
The others are non-bonding  electron  (lone pairs). Thus each fluorine  atom in fluorine
molecule  has three lone-pairs  of electrons.  The resulting  molecule  is a diatomic  molecule.
A diatomic  molecule  consists  of two atoms. All the other members  of the halogen
family form diatomic  molecules  in the same way as fluorine  does.
The maximum  number  of covalent  bonds that an atom can form can be predicted
from the number  of electrons  needed  to fill its valence  shell. For example,  each member
of Group IVA elements  has four electrons  in its valence  shell, and it needs four more
electrons  to achieve  stable noble-gas  electron  configuration.  Thus, it forms four covalent
bonds for carbon  in methane,  CH, as shown below:

Types of Covalent  Bonds
How do you compare  the nature and strength  of the bonds in H,, O, and N,?
Atoms can form different  types of covalent  bonds. These are single bonds, double
bonds and triple bonds.
In a single bond two atoms are held together  by one electron  pair.
um
How are the covalent  bonds in H, Cl, and HCI formed?
Many covalent  compounds  are held together  by multiple  bonds. Multiple  bonds are
formed  when two or three electron  pairs are shared by two atoms. If two atoms
share two pairs of electrons,  the covalent  bond is called a double bond. For example,
double bonds are found in molecules  of carbon dioxide  (CO,) and ethene (C,H,).

A triple bond is formed  when two atoms share three pairs of electrons,  as in the
nitrogen  molecule  (N,).

Activity  3.9
Form a group and discuss  the following  idea:
The covalent  bonds are formed by sharing  of electrons.  Compare  covalent  bonds formed
between  atoms of the same elements  and those formed between  atoms of different
elements.  (Example:  H, and HCl).
Present  your conclusion  to the class.
A covalent  bond is formed  when electron  pairs are shared between  two atoms. In
molecules  like H,, in which the atoms are identical,  the electrons  are shared equally
between  the atoms. A covalent  bond in which  the electrons  are shared equally  between
the two atoms is called a non-polar  covalent  bond.
H-H
In other words, a non-polar  bond is a covalent  bond in which bonding  electrons  are
shared equally  between  identical  atoms, resulting  in a balanced  distribution  of electrical
charge.
In contrast,  in the covalently  bonded  HCI molecule,  the H and Cl atoms are of different
elements;  therefore,  they do not share the bonding  electrons  equally.
© CHEMICAL  BONDING ANDINTERMOLECULARFORCES
A chemical  bond in which shared electrons  spend more time in the vicinity  of one
atom than the other is called a polar covalent  bond, or simply a polar bond.
Polarity  of bonds is caused  by differences  in the electronegativity  of the two atoms
forming  the bonds. Electronegativity  is the ability of an atom to attract  the shared
electrons  in a chemical  bond toward  itself.
Elements  with high electronegativity  have a higher  tendency  to attract electrons  than
elements  with low electronegativity.  For example,  in the case of HCI, the electronegativity
of the chlorine  atom is higher  than that of the hydrogen  atom. The shared pair of
electrons  is more strongly  attracted  to the nucleus  of the chlorine  atom. As a result,
the chlorine  atom acquires  a partial negative  charge (0-) whereas  the hydrogen  atom
acquires  a partial positive  charge (5°). The delta is read as "partial"  or "slightly."
If a molecule  has a positive  end and a negative  end, it is said to be polar and posses
a dipole. Dipole  means 'two poles’.
Experimental  evidence  indicates  that, in the HCI molecule,  the electrons  spend more
time near the chlorine  atom. We can think of this unequal  sharing  of electrons  as a
partial electron  transfer  or a shift in electron  density  as shown  below:
This unequal  sharing  of the bonding  electron  pair results in a relatively  higher electron
density  near the chlorine  atom and a correspondingly  lower electron  density  near
hydrogen.

a single bond, b double bond, and c triple covalent  bond?

a H, b CL, c C,H,
3. Draw Lewis structures  for each of the following  molecules:

Also indicate  the partial charges  using 5° and Oo.
A covalent  bond in which one atom donates  both electrons  of the bond is called a
coordinate  covalent  bond. It is also called a dative bond. Such a bond is hypothetically
represented  as:
@ chemistrycrave9
oNAs+ B — ASB
Once formed,  a coordinate  covalent  bond has the same properties  as any other covalent
bond. The atom that contributes  both electrons  for the bond is the donor atom, and
the atom that shares the electron  pair is the acceptor  atom.
For an atom to act as a donor, it must contain  lone pair of electrons  in its valence
Shell and the acceptor  atom must have at least one vacant  orbital.
For example,  the ammonium  ion, NH;, is formed  by a coordinate  covalent  bond in
which the two non-bonding  electrons  on NH, bond with a hydrogen  ion, H", which
has no electrons  to contribute.

Carbon  monoxide,  CO, also has a coordinate  covalent  bond. In order for both carbon
and oxygen  atoms to attain noble-gas  electron  arrangements,  oxygen  donates  a pair of
electrons  to the carbon atom. In the process  a coordinate  covalent  bond is formed
between  the two atoms.

General  properties  of covalent  compounds
1. Covalent  compounds  are generally  liquids or gases at ordinary  temperature.  For
example  : water and ethyl alcohol  are liquids. Hydrogen  chloride,  methane  and
cabon dioxide  are gases. Same covalent  compounds  are solids (e.g. sugar)
2. As compared  to ionic compounds,  covalent  compounds  have relatively  lower
melting  points and boiling  points.
3. They do not conduct  electric  current  when molten  or in aqueous  solution,  because
they consist  of molecules  rather than of ions.
4. Covalent  compounds  are insoluble  in polar solvents  such as water. They are
soluble in non-polar  solvents  such as benzene  and carbon  tetrachloride.

Activity  3.11
Form a group and discuss  the following  concepts  and present  your discussion  to the class.
a Metals are solids.  They contain large number  of atoms in their crystals.  What kind of
force do you think holds these metal atoms together?
lf How do you account  for the properties  of metals,  such as conductivity,  malleability,  and
ductility  in terms of the bonds in metals?
The highest  energy orbitals  of most metals are occupied  by very few electrons.  In
s-block  metals,  for example,  one or two valence  electrons  occupy  s orbitals  in the
outermost  levels (for example  Na and Mg). Furthermore,  the p orbitals  of the outer
most level are also occupied  partially  in p-block  metals (example  Tl, Pb and Bi).
The d-block  metals contain  partially  filled (7—1)d  levels in their atomic states or principal
oxidation  states. The bonding  in metals is different  from that in other types of crystals.
The valence  electrons  of metals are not held by individual  atoms. Rather,  they are
delocalized  and mobile (free to move throughout  the structure).
The valence  electrons  form a sea of electrons  around  the metal ions and these metal
ions are organized  as a crystal. Metallic  bonding  results from the attraction  between
the metal ions and the surrounding  sea of electrons.
For example,  as illustrated  in Figure 3.8, a sodium  metal crystal is a lattice-like  array
of Na* ions surrounded  by a sea of mobile bonding  valence  electrons.

The bonding  valence  electrons  move freely throughout  the entire crystal. This freedom
of movement  is responsible  for the electrical  conductivity  of metals.
Properties  of Metallic  Bonding
Have  you ever visited  a goldsmith  workshop?  Why are metals  easily  shaped  into
thin sheets and drawn into wires?
The freedom  of movement  of bonding  valence  electrons  is responsible  for the high
electrical  and thermal  conductivity  that characterizes  the metals. Other properties  of
metallic  bonding  contribute  to unique properties  of metals. For example,  most metals
are easy to shape due to their malleability  and ductility.
Malleability  allows a substance  such as a metal to be reshaped.  By hammering  and
bending  some metals,  you can create thin sheets. Ductility  allows a substance  to be
drawn or pulled out into long thin pieces, such as wires.
Metals are malleable  and ductile  because  metallic  bonding  is the same in all directions
throughout  the solid.
When we apply a force to metal, its cations swim freely within  the sea of electrons
without  breaking  the crystal structure.  For example,  when you hammer,  bend, or pull
on a metal to reshape  it, you shift its cations around.  The force you apply moves the
atoms around,  for example,  around  corners  in the lattice. This is the basis for malleability
and ductility  of metals,  which allows you to change its shape.
Model of a Metallic  Crystal
Put about one hundred  balls (for example,  marble balls or balls made from other locally
available  materials)  into a rectangular  glass trough.  Shake the trough.  Allow the balls to

the trough.
b If the balls represent  atoms in a metallic lattice, which species are occupying  the
‘empty’  space between  and around  them?
Present  your model and findings  to the class.

Activity  3.12
Form a group and discuss the following  phenomenon:  Why do covalent  compounds
usually  exist as gases and liquids?
Share your views with the rest of the class.
Inter-molecular  forces are relatively  weak forces of attraction  that occur between
molecules.  Inter-molecular  forces vary in strength  but are generally  weaker  than the
bonds that join atoms in molecules,  ions in ionic compounds,  and metal atoms in solid
metals. Inter-molecular  forces acting between  molecules  include:  dipole-dipole  forces,
London  dispersion  forces and hydrogen  bonding.  Dipole-dipole  attractions  and
London  forces are collectively  called Van der Waal's forces.
A Dipole-Dipole  Forces
Dipole-dipole  forces are strong inter-molecular  forces between  polar molecules.  A dipole
is created  by equal but opposite  charges  separated  by a short distance.  A polar molecule
acts as a tiny dipole because  of its uneven  charge distribution.
A dipole is represented  by an arrow with a head pointing  toward  the negative  pole
and crossed  tail situated  at the positive  pole. The dipole created  by a hydrogen  chloride
molecule,  which has its negative  end at the more electronegative  chlorine  atom, is as
shown  below:
Figure  3.9 Dipole-dipole  interactions  in HCI molecules.
@ GhemstrycravES
The negative  end in one polar molecule  attracts  the positive  end in an adjacent  molecule
in a liquid or solid. Dipole-dipole  forces occur in molecules  such as ethyl alcohol  and
water.
B London  Dispersion  Forces
All molecules,  including  those without  dipole moments,  exert forces on each other. We
know this because  all substances,  even the noble gases, change  from liquid to solid
state under different  conditions.
Induced  dipole
Induced  dipole-induced  dipole  forces
Figure  3.10 Induced  dipole-induced  dipole  forces between  non-polar  molecules.
London  dispersion  forces act between  all atoms and molecules.  They are the only
forces that exist between  noble gas atoms and non-polar  molecules.  This fact is reflected
in the low boiling  points of noble gases and non-polar  molecules.  Because  dispersion
forces result from temporary  redistribution  of the electrons  causing  induced  dipole-
dipole interactions,  their strength  increases  with the number  of electrons  in the interacting
atoms or molecules.  Hence, dispersion  forces increase  with atomic  number  or molar
mass. This trend can be seen by comparing  the boiling  points of gases (helium,  He,
and argon, Ar), (hydrogen,  H,, and oxygen,  O,), and (chlorine,  Cl,, and bromine,
Br,).
As an illustration,  the boiling  points of the noble gases are presented  in Table 3.4.
Table 3.3 Boiling  points  of noble  gases.
As you look down the column  of noble gases, you note that boiling  point increases.
This is because  the induced  dipole-dipole  interaction  increases.
C Hydrogen  Bonding
Hydrogen  bonding  is a particular  type of intermolecular  force arising  when a hydrogen
atom is bonded  to highly electronegative  elements,  fluorine,  oxygen  and nitrogen.
Hydrogen  bonding  is a particular  type of dipole-dipole  interactions  between  polar
compounds.  In such compounds,  large electronegativity  differences  between  the hydrogen
and the fluorine,  oxygen,  or nitrogen  atoms make the bonds connecting  them highly
polar. This polarity  gives the hydrogen  atom a positive  charge. Moreover,  the small
size of the hydrogen  atom allows the atom to come very close to an unshared  pair of
electrons  on an adjacent  molecule. Hydrogen  bonding  is responsible  for the unusual
high boiling  points of some compounds  such as hydrogen  fluoride  (HF), water (HO)
and ammonia  (NH,).
Hydrogen  bonds are usually  represented  by dotted lines connecting  the hydrogen  atom
to the unshared  electron  pair of the electronegative  atom to which it is attracted. For
example,  the hydrogen  bond in hydrogen  fluoride,  HF, results when the highly
electronegative  F atom attracts  the H atoms of an adjacent  molecule.

Van der Waal's  forces
A chemical  bond is the attractive  force that binds atoms together  to form a
molecule  (or a crystal lattice),  an ionic or metallic  crystal lattice.
An ionic bond is the electrostatic  attraction  between  oppositely  charged  ions
(cations  and anions).
A covalent  bond is formed  by a shared  pair of electrons.
A covalent  bond in which one pair of electrons  is shared is known as a single
bond; for example,  H, written  as H — H.
Atoms can also share more than one pair of electrons  to form a multiple  bond.
The sharing  of three pairs of electrons  forms  a triple bond - for example,  N,,,
written  as N=N.
A dative or coordinate  covalent  bond is a bond in which one of the atoms
supplies  both of the shared electrons  to the covalent  bond.
A metallic  bond is the electrostatic  attraction  between  positive  metal ions and
delocalized  electrons.
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULARFORCES
Inter-molecular  forces are forces of attraction  between  covalently  bonded

bonding.
London  forces are forces of attractions  between  nonpolar  molecules.
Dipole-dipole  forces are the attractions  between  dipoles  of polar molecules.

CHEMICAL  REACTIONS AND SToIcHIOMETAY
Chemical  reactions  are the basis of chemistry.  Chemical  reactions  occur around  us all
the time. For example,  the burning  of fuel, the souring  of milk, metabolic  processes  of
our body and the decay of plants are some familiar  chemical  reactions  in daily life.
A chemical  reaction  is the process  in which reacting  substances,  called reactants,  are
converted  to new substances,  called products.  The characteristics  of the products  are
completely  different  from those of the reactants.  The conversion  process  is a chemical
change.
Reactants — Products
For example,  if you burn magnesium  with oxygen,  the magnesium  and oxygen  are
completely  converted  to magnesium  oxide. Magnesium  oxide is a soft, white,
crumbling  powder.  These characteristics  of magnesium  oxide are completely  different
from the characteristics  of the original  substances,  magnesium  and oxygen.  Magnesium
and oxygen  are no longer present  in the elemental  form.
In summary,  a chemical  reaction  has occurred  in which  the reactants,  magnesium  and
oxygen,  underwent  a complete  chemical  change,  giving  the product  magnesium  oxide.
All chemical  reactions  include  three types of changes  in the original  substances.  These
are changes  in composition,  properties  and energy.
Activity  4.2
Form a group and perform  the following  task.
List some chemical  processes  that occur in your daily life. Identify  the reactants  and

Present  your findings  to the class.
Note that, in daily life, we use different  terms for the same process of chemical
change.  For example  “the souring  of milk” occurs due to the process  of fermentation.
In scientific  discussion  we generally  have a single term for each process.

the mass of the wood that is no longer present?
Present  your conclusion  to the class.
While investigating  the quantitative  relations  between  substances  in chemical  reactions,
scientists  formulated  the three basic laws of chemical  combination.  These are:
i) The law of conservation  of mass
ii) The law of definite  proportions
iii) The law of multiple  proportions
i) The Law of Conservation  of Mass
In 1774, the French  chemist  Antoine  Lavoisier  performed  an experiment  in which he
heated a sealed glass container  that held a sample  of tin in air. He measured  the mass of
the substances  before and after heating  and found them to be the same. This and other
similar  experimental  observations  became  the basis of the law of conservation  of mass.
French chemist  Antoine Lavoisier  is considered  the founder  of
modern chemistry.  He found that the amount  of matter before a
chemical  reaction  is equal to the amount  of matter  afterwards,  even
« though the matter may change in its form. Lavoisier  also
experimented  with the role of oxygen in combustion  and
_ respiration  in both plants and animals.
Antoine  Lavoisier
The law of conservation  of mass states that matter is neither  created  nor destroyed  in a
chemical  reaction. In other words, the mass of the reactants  is exactly  equal to the
mass of the products,  within  the limits of experimental  error. This law is also known  as
the law of indestructibility  of matter.
Mass of reactants  = Mass of products
There is no loss or gain of substances  during a chemical  reaction,  and mass is
conserved.
For example,  consider  the decomposition  of mercury  (II) oxide. When 100 g of
mercury  (II) oxide decomposes  by heat, 92.6 g of mercury  and 7.4 g of oxygen  are
formed.  Note that the total mass of mercury  and oxygen  after decomposition  is 100 g:

ii) The Law of Definite  Proportions
The law of definite  proportions  states that a compound  always contains  the same
elements  in the same proportion  by mass. This means that all pure samples  of a
compound  have the same composition  regardless  of the source of sample. This law is
also known  as the law of constant  composition.  For example,  sample  of water could
be obtained  from different  sources,  such as from  a river, the ground,  or the ocean.
But whatever  the original  source, all forms of pure water contains  11.2% hydrogen
and 88.8% oxygen  by mass. These percentages  represent  a ratio of 1.0 to 8.0 (1:8),
by mass, of hydrogen  to oxygen.
This ratio is constant  (fixed) for water. In other words, a compound  with a different
ratio of hydrogen  and oxygen  is not water.
Similarly,  in forming  the compound  ZnO, 65.0 g of zinc combines  with 16.0 g of
oxygen.  This is 80.2% zinc and 19.8% oxygen,  by mass. As is the case for water,
the composition  of ZnO is constant.  In forming  ZnO, zinc combines  with oxygen  in a
definite  proportion.

iii) The Law of Multiple  Proportions
The law of multiple  proportions  states that when two elements  combine  to form more
than one compound,  the masses of one element  combined  with a fixed mass of the
second  element  are in the ratio of small whole numbers.  This law can be illustrated  by
the two oxides of carbon. The two oxides of carbon are carbon  monoxide  (CO) and
carbon  dioxide  (CO,). In CO,, 1.0 g of carbon is combined  with 2.67 g of oxygen;
whereas  in CO, 1.0 g of carbon is combined  with 1.33 g of oxygen.  By comparing
2.67 g of oxygen  with 1.33 g of oxygen,  it is found that the masses of oxygen  in the
two compounds  that combine  with the same mass of carbon are in the simple whole
number  ratio, 2:1.

Activity  4.5
Form a group and discuss  each of the following:
1. What is the difference  between  a chemical  equation  and a chemical  reaction?
2. Which law is satisfied  when a chemical  equation  is balanced?  Take a simple chemical
reaction  to illustrate  this law.
Present  your conclusion  to the class.
A chemical  equation  is a shorthand  representation  of a chemical  reaction  in terms of
chemical  symbols  and formulas.  In a chemical  equation  the starting  substances  are
called reactants;  and the new substances  produced  are known  as products.
Reactants  are written  on the left side and products  on the right side of the equation.
An arrow (—>) is placed  between  the two sides to indicate  transformation  of reactants
into products.
Reactants — products
In writing  chemical  equation,  instead  of using words, chemical  symbols  and formulas
are used to represent  the reaction.
Steps to Write a Chemical  Equation
1. Write a word equation:  A word equation  is stated in words. For example,  the
word equation  for the reaction  between  sodium  and chlorine  to produce  sodium
chloride  is written  as:
Sodium  + Chlorine — Sodium  chloride  (word  equation)
Note that we read the '+ ' sign as 'reacts with' and the arrow can be read as
'to produce’,  'to form’, 'to give' or 'to yield’.
2. Write the symbols  and formulas  for the reactants  and products  in the word
equation.
Na+ Cl, — NaCl (Chemical  equation)
3. Balance  the equation.
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
mxd¢  _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
Generally,  any chemical  equation  must fulfil the following  conditions:
i) The equation  must represent  a true and possible  chemical  reaction.
ii) The symbols  and formulas  must be written  correctly.  The elements—  hydrogen,
nitrogen,  oxygen,  fluorine,  chlorine,  bromine  and iodine exist as diatomic
molecules.  These elements  should  be written  as molecules  in the equation.
iii) The equation  must be balanced.
A chemical  equation  has both qualitative  and quantitative  meanings.
Qualitatively,  a chemical  equation  indicates  the types of the reactants  and products
in the reaction.
Quantitatively,  a chemical  equation  expresses  the relative number (amount)
of moles, molecules  or masses  of the reactants  and products.
Which should  be adjusted  in balancing  a chemical  equation,  the subscripts  or
the coefficients?
According  to the law of conservation  of mass, atoms are neither created nor
destroyed  during a chemical  reaction. As a result, the number  of atoms of each
element  should remain  the same before and after the reaction.  Therefore,  the main
reason why all chemical  equations  must be balanced  is just to obey the law of
conservation  of mass.
To balance  a chemical  equation  means to equalize  the number  of atoms on both sides
of the equation  by putting  appropriate  coefficients  in front of the formulas.
Only two methods  of balancing  chemical  equations  will be discussed  under this topic.
These are the inspection  and the Least Common  Multiple  (LCM)  method.
1. The Inspection  Method
Most simple chemical  equations  can be balanced  using this method. Balancing  an
equation  by inspection  means to adjust coefficients  by trial and error until the equation
is balanced. Follow  the following  four steps to balance  the chemical  equation.
Step 1: Write the word equation.
Step 2: Write the correct  symbols  or formulas  for the reactants  and products.
Step 3: Place the smallest  whole number  coefficients  in front of the symbols  or
formulas  until the number  of atoms of each element  is the same on both sides
of the equation.
104
Step 4: Checking:  By counting  the number  of atoms on both sides of the equation,
make sure that the atoms of all elements  are balanced  and also the
coefficients  are expressed  as the smallest  whole number  ratio.
Note:
When  you balance  an equation,  do not change  any symbol  or formula  of any compound.
If you change a symbol  or formula,  it no longer  represents  the element  or compound
required  by the equation.
Example  1
Balance  the equation  for the reaction  between  magnesium  and oxygen  to
produces  magnesium  oxide.
Solution:
Step 1: Magnesium  + Oxygen — Magnesium  oxide
Step 2: Mg +O, — MgoO (unbalanced)
Step 3: Put coefficients  to balance  the equation
¢ Oxygen  is not balanced.  There are two oxygen  atoms on the left side and
one on the right side. Hence, place the coefficient  2 in front of MgO.
Mg +O, — 2MgO (unbalanced)
¢ Now Mg is not balanced.  There is one Mg on the left side and two on the
right side. Thus, place the coefficient  2 in front of Mg.
2Mg +O, — 2MgoO (balanced)
Step 4: Checking:  There are two Mg and two O atoms on each side of the
equation.  Therefore,  the equation  is correctly  balanced.
2Mg +O, > 2MgO

1. Na+ H,O — NaOH + H,

4. Al+H,PO,  — AIPO, + H,
5. HNO,+ H,S — NO+S+H,0
max
2. The LCM  Method
In the LCM method,  the coefficients  for the balanced  chemical  equation  are obtained
by taking the LCM of the total valency  of reactants  and products  and then dividing  it
by total valency  of reactants  and products.  All the necessary  steps to balance a
chemical  equation  by the LCM method,  are shown  by the following  examples.
Solution:
Step 1:
Step 2:

Step 5:When aluminium  reacts with oxygen, aluminium  oxide is formed. Write

Represent  the reaction  by a word equation.

products.

* The total valency  of oxygen  in Al,O, is 2 x 3 = 6.
Find the LCM of each total valency  and place it above the arrow.

When  the bread baked,does  the bread  absorb  or release  heat energy?  Justify  your answer.
Present  your conclusion  to the class.
Almost  all chemical  reactions  are accompanied  by energy changes.  These energy
changes  could be in the form of heat energy, light energy, electrical  energy, and so on.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY  —
On the basis of energy changes,  chemical  reactions  can be divided  into exothermic
and endothermic  reactions.
Can heat energy be considered  as a reactant  or product?
Exothermic  Reaction
A chemical  reaction  that releases  heat energy  to the surroundings  is known as an
exothermic  reaction.  During  an exothermic  process,  heat is given out from the system
to its surroundings  and this heat energy is written  on the right side of the equation  as
shown  below.
Reactants  — Products  + Heat
For example,  the burning  of carbon  with oxygen  produces  carbon dioxide  and heat is
released  during  the reaction. Thus, the reaction  is exothermic  and written  as:
C+ O, > CO, + Heat
Endothermic  Reaction
A chemical  reaction  which absorbs  heat energy from the surroundings  is known  as an
endothermic  reaction.  During  an endothermic  process,  heat flows into the system  from
its surroundings  and the heat is written  on the left side of the equation.
Reactants  + Heat — products
For example,  the reaction  between  carbon and sulphur  to form carbon disulphide  is
an endothermic  reaction  because  heat is absorbed  in the reaction.
C+ 2S + Heat > CS,
The amount  of heat energy liberated  or absorbed  by a chemical  reaction  is called heat
of reaction  or change in enthalpy  for the reaction.  It is symbolized  as AH. Its unit is
expressed  in kilojoules  per mol (KY  ol): The change in enthalpy  (A) is the difference
between  the energy  of the products  and the energy  of the reactants.
AH = A, — H_; where A, is the heat content  (energy)  of the product, /7, is the
heat content  (energy)  of the reactant.
For endothermic  reactions,  AH is positrve  because  the energy of the product  is higher
than the energy of the reactant.  As a result, the enthalpy  of the system increases  as
shown in Figure 4.3.
since, HTDp? H,, AH= positive (AH > 0)
For example,  when nitrogen  reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen  dioxide, 66.4 kJ of
heat energy is absorbed (i.e., AH = + 66.4 kJ/mol) and thus the reaction is
endothermic.

For exothermic  reactions,  AH is negative because the energy of the reactants is
greater than the energy of the products.  Thus, the enthalpy  of the system decreases,
as shown in Figure 4.4.
Hi, < H, = AH = negative  (AH < 0)
For example,  when carbon burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, 393.5 kJ of
heat energy is liberated  and hence the reaction is exothermic  (AH = —393.5 kJ/mol).

Form a group and perform  the following  task. In your daily life you encounter  with many
chemical  changes  involving  energy. List some of such changes  and discuss their
importance.
Share your findings  with the rest of the class.
Chemical  reactions  bring about chemical  changes.  All chemical  changes are
accompanied  by energy changes.  This energy is usually  in the form of heat, light, or
electricity.
Energy  changes  produced  by chemical  reactions  have many practical  applications
(uses). For example,  energy lifts rockets, runs cars, and extracts metal from
compounds.
Many applications  involve  the energy  produced  by fuel combustion,  which liberates
large amounts  of heat. The energy can be converted  from one form to another.  For
example,  the energy  that fuel combustion  produces  can convert  water to steam.
The steam can run a turbine  that creates electricity.
Respiration  (breathing)  creates energy  for our bodies. Breathing  releases  the energy
our living cells produce  by oxidizing  glucose.  This energy  helps to maintain  our
body temperature  and body exercises.

A reaction  in which  two or more substances  combine  to form a single substance  is
called a combination  reaction.  In a combination  reaction,  two elements,  two compounds,
or an element  and a compound  react to form a single compound.  Combination
reactions  can be represented  by the following  general  form of equation.
A+B — AB;
where  the reactants  A and B are elements  or compounds,  the product  AB is a compound.
Such type of reaction  is also known  as synthesis  or composition  reaction.

A decomposition  reaction  is a reaction  that involves  the breaking  down of a single
compound  into two or more elements  or simpler compounds.  A decomposition
reaction  can be carried out using heat, light, electricity  or a catalyst.  But most
decomposition  reactions  are carried  out when heat is supplied  and this heat energy  is
indicated  by a ‘delta’ (A) symbol  above the arrow. The general  form of equation  for
a decomposition  reaction  is:
AB > A+B
where the reactant  AB must be a compound  and the products A and B could be
elements  or compounds.

¢ Water is decomposed  to hydrogen  and oxygen  gases when electricity  is passed
through  it.

A reaction  in which one element  displaces  another  element  from its compound  is
known as single displacement  or replacement  reaction.  Such a reaction  is represented
by the following  two general  forms.
A+BC > B+t+AC
If A is a metal, it will displace  B to form AC, provided  A is a more active metal
than B.
A+BC > BA+T+C
If A is a non-metal,  it will displace  C to form BA, provided  A is a more active
non-metal  than C.
— @ chemistaveraDeS
In general, a more reactive element displaces  a less reactive element from a
compound.
Examples  of single-displacement  reactions
a Active  metals displace  hydrogen  from acids.
Reactive  metals such as potassium,  calcium,  sodium,  and zinc displace  hydrogen
gas from dilute acids.
For example,  zinc is an active metal, and it displaces  hydrogen  from hydrochloric
acid; but copper  metal cannot  do so.
Zn + 2HCIl > ZnCl, + H,

@  cewistevcrADES
The quantitative  relationship  between  reactants  and products  in a balanced  chemical
equation  is known as stoichiometry.  In other words, stoichiometry  is the study of the
amount  or ratio of moles, mass, energy and volumes  (for gases) of reactants  and
products.  Stoichiometric  calculations  are based on the following  two major principles.
i) The composition  of any substance  in the chemical  equation  should  be expressed
by a definite  formula.
ii) The law of conservation  of mass must be obeyed  (the mass of reactants  equals
the mass of products).
From a balanced  chemical  equation,  it is possible  to determine  the:
¢ number  of moles of each reactant  and product;  and
e relative  mass of each of the reactants  and products
For example,  in the reaction  of hydrogen  with oxygen  to produce  water, 2 moles of
H, combines  with 1 mole of O, to yield 2 moles of H,O. The equation  also tells us
4 g of hydrogen  reacts with 32 g of oxygen  to produce  36 g of water. This can be
further interpreted  as follows:
2H(g) + Og) 2 2H,0()
Mole — 2 mole 1 mole 2 mole
Molecule — 2 molecule 1 molecule 2 molecule
Mass> 4g8 32 g 2x 18g
36 g reactant 36 g product
Calculations  based on chemical  equations  (stoichiometric  problems)  are classified
into mass-mass  problem,  volume-volume  problems  and mass-volume  problems.
In mass-mass  problems,  the mass of one substance  is given, and the mass of the
second substance  is determined  from the same reaction. There are two methods  for
solving  such types of problems:
i) Mass-ratio  method
ii) Mole-ratio  method
Let us see each method  by using the necessary  steps.
i) The mass-ratio  method
In this type of stoichiometric  calculation,  the mass of one substance  is determined
from the given mass of the other substance  using the following  steps.
Step 1: Write the balanced  chemical  equation.
Step 2: Place the given mass above the corresponding  formula,  and x above the
formula  of the substance  whose mass is to be determined.
Step 3: Write the total molar mass of the substances  below the formula  of each
substance.  (Zotal molar mass is the molar mass of the substance
multiplied  by its coefficient).
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown  mass, x.
Example  1
How many grams of calcium  chloride  are formed  when 15 g of calcium  metal
reacts with hydrochloric  acid?
Solution:
Step 1: Ca + 2HCl — CaCl, + H,
15g
Step 2: Ca+ 2HC] > CaCl, + H,

Step 5: x = 41.63 g
Therefore,  41.63 g of CaCl, is produced.

Step 5: x = 56.8 g
ii) The mole-ratio  method
The mole ratio is the ratio between  the numbers  of moles of any two substances  in a
given reaction.  In this method,  the given mass is converted  into moles, and the number
of moles for the required  substance  is calculated.  If needed,  convert  the obtained
moles back to mass.
Follow  the steps given below to solve problems  of mass-mass  relationships  by the
mole ratio method:
Step 1: Write the balanced  chemical  equation.
Step 2: Convert  the given mass to moles and write the obtained  moles and the
required  quantity,  x, above the formulas  of the respective  substances.
Step 3: Place the coefficients  as the number  of moles under the formula  of each
substance  involved.
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown  value, x; and convert  the moles obtained  into mass.
Example  3
How many grams of sodium  metal are needed  to react with 10.0 g of water?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Na + 2H,O — 2NaOH  + H,
given  mass 10.0gStep 2: moles of H,O = = = 0.56 mol

Step 5: x = 0.56 mol of Na
Now, convert  0.56 mole of Na to grams
mass of Na= mole x molar mass
= 0.56 mol x 23 g/mol
= 12.88 g
Therefore,  12.88 g of sodium  metal is needed  to react with 10 g of water.
Example  4

magnesium  nitrate?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Mg (NO,), — 2MgO + 4NO, + O,

Step 2: moles of Mg (NO,),  = 148 2/mol= 1.23 mol

Step 5: x = 2.46 moles of NO,
Mass of NO, = 2.46 mol x 46 g/mol = 113.2 g
Therefore,  113.2 g of NO, is produced.

according  to the following  equation?
CaCO, + 2HCI — CaCl, + CO, + H,O
2. How many grams of NaOH are needed  to neutralize  50 grams of H,SO,?
3. Calculate  the mass of CaCl, formed  when 5 moles of chlorine  reacts with
calcium  metal.
4. How many moles of H,O are required  to produce 4.5 moles of HNO,
according  to the following  reaction:
3NO, + H,O > 2HNO, + NO
5. In the decomposition  of KCIO,,  how many moles of KCI are formed  in the
reaction  that produces  0.05 moles of O,?
6. How many moles of CaO are needed  to react with excess water to produce
370 g of calcium  hydroxide?
In reactions  involving  gases, the volume  of gases can be determined  on the principle
that 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 litres at STP (standard
temperature  and pressure,  STP, the temperature  is 0°C and the pressure  is I atm).
It is also known  that 22.4 L of any gas weighs exactly  its molecular  mass at STP. This
volume,  22.4 litres, of a gas is known  as the molar volume.
At STP, 1 mole of any gas = 22.4 L = gram volume  mass of the gas
The relationship  between  the volume  of a gas and its number  of molecules  was
explained  by Avogadro.  Avogadro's  law states that equal volumes  of different  gases,
under the same conditions  of temperature  and pressure,  contain  equal number  of
molecules.  This law can also be stated as the volume  of a gas is proportional  to the
number  of molecules  (moles)  of the gas at STP.

dioxide?
2. How many litres of sulphur  trioxide  are formed  when 4800 cm? of sulphur

KCIO, at STP?
5. How many moles of water vapour  are formed  when 10 litres of butane gas,

In mass-volume  problems,  either the mass of one substance  is given and the volume
of the other is required  or the volume  of one substance  is given and the mass of the
other one is required.  The steps to solve such type of problems  are the same as the
previous  steps except  putting  the masses on one side and the volumes  on the other
side of the equality  sign.

4.6.5 Limiting  and Excess Reactants
When all the reactants  are completely  consumed  in a chemical  reaction,  then such
reactants  are said to be in stoichiometric  proportions.  But, practically  these types of
chemical  reactions  do not always occur. In many cases, an excess of one or more
131
reactants  is encountered  in the reaction  and the other reactant  is completely  converted
into products.  Thus, the reactant  that is completely  consumed  in the reaction  is known
as the limiting  reactant,  because  it limits or determines  the amount  of products  that can
be formed.
For example,  consider  the following  reaction:
H, + Cl, ~ 2HCI
1 mole 1 mole 2 moles
According  to the equation,  1 mole of H, reacts with 1 mole of chlorine  to produce  2
mole of HCl. Thus, all the reactants  are completely  consumed  and only products
appear. However  if 1 mole of H, reacts with 1.5 mole of Cl,, there is insufficient  H,
to react with all of the Cl,. Therefore,  Cl, will be in excess and H, will be the limiting
reactant.  Only 2 moles of HCl are formed  and at the end of the reaction  0.5 mole of
Cl, remains  unreacted.
Example  8
How much ammonia  is produced  if 10 g of hydrogen  reacts with 18 g of
nitrogen?
Solution :
3H,(g) + N,(g) > 2NH,(g)
First determine  the number  of moles;
10Moles of H, = © — 5 mol
2 g/mol
18g
Moles of N, = 28 g/mol = 0.64 mol
Now, calculate  the number  of moles or masses  of the product  that would be
formed  by each reactant.
The reactant  that gives the smallest  amount  of product  is the limiting  reactant.
i. Using the quantity  of H, ii. Using the quantity  of N,

= 56.6 g =21.8¢
CHEMICAL REACTIONS ANDSTOICHIOMETRY  =a
Solution:Therefore,  the limiting  reactant  is nitrogen,  because  it gives less amount  of
NH,, z.e., 21.8 g NH,. In the reaction,  0.64 mole (18 g) of N, is consumed.
Hydrogen  is in excess. The amount  of hydrogen  consumed  will be:
x 18g x 0.64 mol
3H,+N, > 2NH, oe 3H, + N, — 2NH,
6g 28g 3moles 1mole
x 18 x _ 0.64mol
6 7 28 3 mol lmol
x = 3.86 g of H, x = 1.92 mol of H,
Therefore,  3.86 g or 1.92 moles of H, is used in the reaction,  and 6.14 g or
3.08 moles of H, is left unreacted.
Example  9
In the chemistry  laboratory,  a student  performed  a displacement  reaction  by

determined  first.

¢ Distinguish  between  redox and non-redox  reactions.
Activity  4.10
Form a group and discuss  the following  phenomenon:
When you dry your meal dishes with a towel, the towel can be termed  as a drying agent
and the dish as wetting agent. What happens  to the towel and the dish, in terms of
getting wet and dry, after cleaning?  Relate this idea with oxidizing  agent and reducing
agent, oxidation  and reduction  of substances.  Present  your conclusion  to the class.
In our day to day activity,  we are familiar  with the chemical  processes  like rusting  of
iron, burning  of substances,  breathing  of air, digestion  of food and so on. All such
types of processes  or reactions  are known as oxidation  and reduction  or redox
reactions.
Can oxidation  take place without  reduction?
Oxidation:  is the process  in which a substance  loses electrons  in a chemical  reaction.
For example,  in the reaction
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY  —
Each sodium  atom has lost one electron  and has turned  to a sodium  ion.
Hence, sodium  is oxidized.
Na+ le — Na*
Reduction:  is the process in which a substance  gains electrons  in a chemical
reaction.
For example,  in the above reaction  each chlorine  atom has gained an
electron  and has changed  to chloride  ion. Thus, chlorine  is reduced;
Cl, +2e > Cr
The processes  of oxidation  and reduction  always occur simultaneously  because  if one
substance  loses electrons,  the other substance  must gain these electrons.  Since the
process  of oxidation  and reduction  involves  the transfer  of electrons,  it also results in
the changes  of oxidation  number.  Thus, oxidation  and reduction  can also be defined  in
terms of oxidation  number.  Oxidation  is an increase  in the oxidation  number  of an
element  and reduction  is a decrease  in the oxidation  number.  For example,  in the
reaction,
0 0 +1 -1
Na+Cl, — 2NaCl
Reduced t ,
Oxidized
The oxidation  number  of sodium is increased  from 0 to +1 and thus sodium is
oxidized.  The oxidation  number  of chlorine  is decreased  from 0 to —1, and therefore
chlorine  is reduced.
Oxidation  number  or oxidation  state is the number  of electrons  that an atom appears
to have gained or lost when it is combined  with other atoms.
| Rules for Assigning  Oxidation  Numbers
Rule 1: The oxidation  number  of all elements  in free state is zero. This rule is also
applied  for diatomic  or polyatomic  elements.
Example:  The oxidation  number  of Na = 0, Cu = 0, Cl in CL, = 0, O in
O, = 0, S in S, = 0.
Rule 2: The oxidation  number  of a monatomic  ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
Example:  Na* = +1, Mg** = +2, S?- = -2.
Rule 3: The oxidation  number  of oxygen  in a compound  is usually  — 2 except  in the
following  cases:
137
Exceptions
The oxidation  number  of oxygen  in:
i) peroxides  is —1. Example:  Na,O,
ii) superoxides  is —1/2. Example:  KO,
iii) oxygen  diflouride  is +2. Example:  OF,
Rule 4: The oxidation  number  of hydrogen  in its entire compounds  is +1 except
in metal hydrides,  (like NaH, CaH, and AIH,), where its oxidation
number  is —1.
Rule 5: The sum of the oxidation  number  of all the atoms in a neutral compound  is
Zero.
Example:  1,50, ((+2) + (+6) + C8) = 0)
Rule 6: Ina polyatomic  ion, the sum of the oxidation  numbers  of the constituent
atoms equals the charge on the ion.
Example: (§0,)?_ ((+6) + (8) = -2)
Rule 7: Elements  of group IA have +1 and group ITA have +2 oxidation  states in all
of their compounds.
Rule 8: In a compound,  the more electronegative  element  is assigned  a negative
oxidation  number,  and the less electronegative  element  is assigned  a positive
oxidation  number.
+3 -1
Example:  NCl, (chlorine  is more electronegative  than nitrogen)
Example  1
What is the oxidation  number  of chromium  in Na,Cr,O,?
Solution :
The oxidation  number  of O is —2 (Rule 3)
The oxidation  number  of Na is +1 (Rule 7)
Let the oxidation  number  of Cr be x.
+] x 2
Na, Cr, O,
Since the sum of the oxidation  numbers  of Na, Cr, and O in Na,Cr,O,  is 0
(Rule 5)
CHEMICAL  REACTIONS  AND STOICHIOMETRY -
2
Then, Na, Cr, O,
(1 x 2) +(e x 2)+ (27) =0
2+ 2x-14 =0
x =+6
Therefore,  the oxidation  number  of Cr in Na,Cr,O,  is +6.
Example  2
What is the oxidation  number  of manganese  in MnO,,?
Solution  :
Let the oxidation  number  of Mn be x.
[vin 0: )
The sum of the oxidation  numbers  of Mn and O in MnO, is —1 (Rule 6)
x + (2 x 4) =-l
x-8 =-l
x =+7
Therefore,  the oxidation  number  of Mn in MnO; is +7.
Example  3
Determine  the oxidation  number  of phosphorus  in Ca(H,PO,),.
Solution:
The oxidation  number  of Ca is +2 (Rule 7).
Let, the oxidation  number  of P be x.

+2 + (4 x (+1) + 2 x x) + (8 x 2) = 0

e Fett > Fe*+ & f N+3e 73 N*
In a redox reaction,  the substance  that causes another  substance  to get oxidized,  but
itself gets reduced,  is known  as an oxidizing  agent, or oxidant.  In the same manner,
the substance  that causes another  substance  to get reduced,  but itself oxidized,  is
referred  to as a reducing  agent or reductant.
¢ QOxidizing  agents are substances  that:
— are reduced  (gain electrons)
— contain  elements  whose oxidation  number  decreases
¢ Reducing  agents are substances  that:
— are oxidized  (lose electrons)
— contain  elements  whose oxidation  number  increases
Tests for an oxidizing  agent are accomplished  by mixing it with a substance  which is
easily oxidized  to give a visible colour change  when the reaction  takes place.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
For example,
i)Permanganate  ion (MnO, ) in acidic solution  changes  colour from purple to
colourless.
MnO; — Mn?*
Dichromate  in acidic solution  changes  colour  from orange  to green.
2- 3Cr,0,7 — Cre
Other common  oxidizing  agents are chlorine,  potassium  chromate,  sodium  chlorate
and manganese  (IV) oxide.
Similarly,  certain  reducing  agents undergo  a visible colour change  with a substance
which is easily reduced.
For example,
i)
ii)A moist starch solution  changes  potassium  iodide paper to blue-black  to show
that iodine is formed,  21” — I,. That is potassium  iodide is a reducing  agent.
Hydrogen  sulphide  bubbled  through  a solution  of an oxidizing  agent forms a
yellow  precipitate,  S*~ — S. That is H,S is a reducing  agent.
Other common  reducing  agents are carbon, carbon monoxide,  sodium
thiosulphate,  sodium  sulphite  and iron (II) salts.
The oxidizing  or reducing  ability of substances  depend  on many factors. Some
of these are:
Electronegativity:  Elements  with high electronegativity  such as F,, O,, N., and
Cl, are good oxidizing  agents. Elements  with low electronegativity  for example,
metallic  elements  like Na, K, Mg and Al are good reducing  agents.
Oxidation  states: In a compound  or ion, if one of its elements  is in a higher
oxidation  state, then it is an oxidizing  agent. Similarly,  if an element  of a compound
or ion is in a lower oxidation  state, then it is a reducing  agent..
Examples

4.7.4 Analysing  Redox Reactions
Oxidation  and reduction  reactions  are called Redox reactions.  Oxidation  and
reduction  reaction  take place simultaneously  in a given reaction.
Activity  4.11
Form a group and discuss  the following:
1. Why a reducing  agent undergoes  oxidation?
2. Why must every redox reaction  involve  both an oxidizing  agent and a reducing  agent?
Present  your discussion  to the class.
Example  4
Identify  the oxidizing  agent, reducing  agent, the substance  oxidized  and reduced
in the following  reaction.
H,S + Br, > 2HBr+S
Solution:
Let us assign oxidation  number  to all the elements  of the reactants  and products.
+12 0 +1-1 0
H,S + Br, —»> 2HBr+S
| Reduced |
Oxidized
In the reaction,  the S atom in H,S increases  its oxidation  number  from —2 to
Q. Hence, S is oxidized  and H,S is a reducing  agent. The oxidation  number  of
Br is decreased  from 0 to —1. Thus, Br, is reduced  and is an oxidizing  agent.
Example  5
Write the oxidizing  and reducing  agents for the reaction  given below:
Cu + HNO, — Cu(NO,),  + NO + H,O
Solution:
Write the oxidation  numbers  of each element  and identify  the substances  which
undergo  a change in oxidization  number.
O +14+5-2 +2 45-2 42-2 41-2
Cu +HNO,—  Cu (NO,), + NO + HO
+ Reduced
Oxidized
Therefore,  copper  is a reducing  agent, and HNO, is an oxidizing  agent.
Non-redox  Reactions
So far we have discussed  oxidation  and reduction  reaction  or redox reactions.
However,  there are also reactions  in which oxidation  and reduction  do not occur and
such types of reactions  are known  as non-redox  reactions.
In non-redox  reactions,  no electrons  are exchanged  between  the reacting  substances.
Therefore,  the oxidation  numbers  of the atoms do not change  in the reaction.  Usually  such
types of reactions  involve  the exchange  of positive  and negative  ions. Most of the double
displacement  reactions  and acid-base  reactions  are not oxidation-reduction  reactions.

2. Write the balanced  chemical  equation.
Every chemical  reaction  proceeds  at different  rates or speed. Some reactions  proceed
very slowly and may take a number  of days to complete;  while others are very rapid,
requiring  only a few seconds.
The rate of a chemical  reaction  measures  the decrease  in concentration  of a reactant
or the increase  in concentration  of a product  per unit time. This means that the rate of
a reaction  determines  how fast the concentration  of a reactant  or product  changes
with time. The rate of a reaction  is obtained  by determining  the concentration  of
reactants  or products  during the reaction.  Methods  for determining  the concentration
of reactants  or products  depend  on the type of reactions.  Some of the methods  are:
Colour  (changes  in colour)
Pressure  (increase  or decrease  in pressure,  particularly  in gases)
Volume  (increase  or decrease  in size, particularly  in gases)a 0o Ff 2
Mass (gain or loss in weight)
e Amount  of precipitate  formed
Generally,  the rate of a reaction  can be obtained  by measuring  either one of the above
changes  in properties  of substances  and consequently  relating  to changes  in their
concentrations  during  the course of the reaction.
Change  in concentration  of substance _ ACRate of reaction  = —Change  in time At
From this expression,  it follows  that the rate of a reaction  is inversely  proportional  to
the time taken by the reaction.
Rate a

Figure 4.12 illustrates  the changes  of the rate of a chemical  reaction  with time. A
reaction  becomes  slower as reactants  are consumed.  The reaction  rate curve becomes
less steep until it becomes  a horizontal  straight  line. No more reactant  is used up at
this point.

Pre-conditions  for a Chemical  Reaction
Chemical  reactions  are usually  explained  by the collision  theory. The assumption  of the
collision  theory is that chemical  reactions  take place due to the collision  between
molecules.
1. Collisions  between  reactants
The first precondition  for a reaction  to occur is the direct contact  of the reacting
substance  with each other. However,  all collisions  between  molecules  are not
necessarily  effective  in bringing  a reaction.
2. Activation  energy
If the collisions  between  the reactant  molecules  do not have sufficient  energy,  then no
reaction  will occur. Therefore,  for the reaction  to take place collision  must always
occur with sufficient  energy  to break the bonds in the reactants  and form new bonds
in the product.  Thus, minimum  amount  of energy  needed  for the reaction  is known  as
activation  energy.
3. Proper Orientation
Collision  of molecules  with sufficient  activation  energy  will not bring a reaction  if the
reacting  molecules  are poorly oriented.  Thus, the collision  between  molecules  should
have the proper  orientation.
147
@ cHemistayeraDES
Consider  the reaction  between  H, and CL, molecules:
H,+Cl, > 2HCI
For the reaction  to occur, first H, and Cl, molecules  must collide  with each other. For
the collision  to be effective,  these colliding  molecules  (H., and Cl,) must have sufficient
energy  to break the H — H and Cl — Cl bonds and consequently  to form new H — Cl
bonds.
Unless,  the H, and Cl, molecules  are oriented  in proper  positions,  there is no product
formed.  Therefore,  as shown in Figure 4.13(c)  the H, and Cl, molecules  rearrange
themselves  so as to form a new H — Cl molecule.

Factors  Affecting  the Rates of Chemical  Reaction
Activity  4.13
Form a group and discuss  each of the following:
1. How is the burning  of charcoal  affected  by:
a_ increasing  the amount  of air used
b adding  more charcoal.
2. How can you increase  the rate of combustion  of a given block of wood ?
Present  your findings  to the class.
Form a group and compare  the rate of combustion  of the following  substances:
a paper c wood charcoal
b kerosene d copper
Present  your findings  to the class.
The rate of a chemical  reaction  depends  on nature of reactants,  temperature,  and
concentration  of reactants,  surface  area and catalysts.
The collision  theory assumes  that the rate of a reaction  depends  on the number
(frequency)  of collisions  of particles  and those factors which affect the frequency  of
collisions  will also affect the rate of a reaction.  Now let us discuss  each factor.
1. Nature  of the reactants
The rate of a reaction  is influenced  by the type and nature of the reacting  substances.
For example,  the following  reactions  have different  rates due to the nature of the
reactants,  Mg, Fe and Cu.
Mg + 2HCl + MgCl, + H, ... (very  fast reaction)
Fe + 2HCl — FeCl, + H, ... (slow reaction)
Cu + HCl — No reaction
2. Temperature
An increase  in temperature  increases  the rate of a reaction.  This is because  as the
temperature  increases,  the average  kinetic energy of the particles  increases  which in
turn increases  the number  of effective  collisions.
In general,  for many chemical  reactions,  the rate of a reaction  doubles  for every 10°C
rise in temperature.
3. Concentration  of reactants
The number  of collisions  is proportional  to the concentration  of reactants.  The higher
the concentration  of the reactants,  the more collisions  between  the reacting  particles
and thus the higher  the rate of the reaction.
For example,  if you heat a piece of steel wool in air (21% oxygen  by volume)  it burns
slowly. But in pure oxygen  (100%  oxygen  by volume)  it bursts in to a dazzling  white
flame. This indicates  that the rate of burning  increases  as the concentration  of oxygen
is higher.

4. Surface  area
When the reactants  are in different  phases, be it solid, liquid or gas, then the surface
area of the substances  affect the rate of the reaction.  The higher the surface area of
reactants,  the faster is the rate of the reaction. This is because  more contact results in
more collisions  between  each small particle of reactants.

5. Catalysts
A catalyst  is a substance  that changes  the rate of a chemical  reaction  without  itself
being consumed  in the reaction.  For example,  the decomposition  of potassium
chlorate,  KCIO, into KCI and O, is made faster in the presence  of MnO, catalyst.
2KCIO,  —“2> 2KC1 +30,Heat
A catalyst  speeds up the rate of a reaction  by providing  an alternative  reaction  path
with lower activation  energy. Lower activation  energy for a reaction  corresponds  to
the higher reaction  rate. Figure 4.16 illustrates  how the presence  of catalysts  speeds

What is the difference  between  positive and negative  catalysts?  Explain  the

In the previous  chapters,  we came across chemical  reactions  in which all the reactants
are completely  converted  to products.  Such types of reactions  are known as
irreversible  reactions.  Irreversible  reactions  proceed  only in one direction  (forward
direction)  and expressed  by a single arrow (—>).
Examples
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
2KCIO, > 2KCl + 30,
However,  there are many chemical  reactions  that do not proceed  to completion.  The
products  at the same time react to give (produce)  the reactants.  These are called
reversible  reactions.
Reversible  reactions  take place in both the forward  and backward  directions  under
the same conditions.  A double arrow (<——) or (——) pointing in opposite
directions  is used in such reaction  equations.
Example
N,+3H, —= 2NH,
The forward  reaction  proceeds  from left to right and the reaction  that goes from right
to left is the reverse  reaction.
Does a reaction  stop if it attains equilibrium?
Chemical  equilibrium  is the state of a chemical  system in which the rates of the
forward  and reverse  reactions  are equal. At the state of chemical  equilibrium,  there is
no net change in the concentrations  of reactants  and products  because  the system  is in
dynamic  equilibrium.  Dynamic  equilibrium  means the reaction  does not stop and both
the forward  and the backward  reactions  continue  at equal rates.
At equilibrium, Rate of forward  reaction  = Rate of reverse  reaction
The law of chemical  equilibrium  can be expressed  mathematically  using the molar
concentrations  of reactants  and products  at equilibrium.  The concentration  of species
is denoted  by enclosing  the formula  in square bracket  [ ].
Thus, for the reversible  reaction:
Rate of forward  reaction  = Kf [A]? [B]? where Kf and K,, are rate constants  for the
Rate of reverse reaction  = K,, [C]° [D]? forward  and reverse reactions  respectively.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS ANDSTOICHIOMETRY,  =}
Since at equilibrium  the rate of the forward  reaction  equals the rate of the reverse
reaction,  it follows:
K, [A}* [B]’ = K, [C]* [DI
Solving  for the constants,  K,/K,, gives a new constant,  termed as the equilibrium

Factors  that Affect Chemical  Equilibrium
Activity  4.18
Form a group and try to explore  at least two properties  that can be utilize to determine
the state of chemical  equilibrium  in system.
Present  your findings  to the class.
A system remains  at a state of chemical  equilibrium  if there is no change in the
external  conditions  that disturb  the equilibrium.  But the point of equilibrium  could be
affected  due to any external  factors like temperature,  pressure,  concentration  and so
on. How  a system  at equilibrium  adjusts itself  to any of these changes  is stated by the
French  chemist  Henri Le Chatelier  in 1888.
Le Chatelier  states that if a stress is applied  to a system in equilibrium,  the system
will respond  in such a way to counteract  the stress. The stress could be change in
temperature,  concentration  or pressure.
The factors  affecting  chemical  equilibrium  and their effects:
1. Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature  changes  on equilibrium  depends  on whether  the reaction  is
exothermic  or endothermic.  An increase  in the temperature  of a system  will favour an
endothermic  reaction  and a decrease  in temperature  favors an exothermic  reaction.
For example,  consider  the following  reaction:
H,O(g) + CO(g) == H,(g) + CO,(g); AH = — 41 kJ
Since the reaction  is exothermic,
i) if temperature  is increased,  the system  will shift to the left.
ii) if temperature  is decreased,  the system  will shift to the right and a high yield of
products  (H, and CO,) is obtained.
€  _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
2. Effect of Pressure  or Volume
Pressure  changes  only affect equilibrium  reaction  involving  gaseous  reactants  and
products.  The effect of pressure  on liquids and solids is negligible.  An increase  in
pressure  (or decrease  in volume)  on a gaseous  system  shifts the equilibrium  in the
direction  of forming  smaller  number  of moles of gas. On the contrary,  decreasing  the
pressure  shifts the equilibrium  in the direction  of forming  more number  of moles of the
gas. For example,  in the reaction,
2CO(g) + O,(g) ——_ 2C0,(g)
N ——
3 moles of gases 2 moles of gases
There are 3 moles of reactants  and 2 moles of product.
Therefore,  increasing  the pressure  of the system  shifts the equilibrium  to the forward
direction.  This results in a higher  yield of CO,. Decreasing  the pressure  of the gaseous
mixture  shifts the equilibrium  in the reverse  direction.
When the number  of moles of reactants  and products  are equal, pressure  has no
effect on the equilibrium.  For example,  in the following  reaction;
H, (g) +1, (g) == 2HI(g)
2 moles of gases 2 molesof  gases
the number  of moles of reactants  and products  are equal (2 mol each) and hence no
effect of pressure  on the equilibrium.
Exercise  4.16
For the following  equilibrium  system,  how would  the position  of the equilibrium  be
changed  if:
a the temperature  is increased; b_ the pressure  is decreased?
c the temperature  is increased,  and d_ the pressure  is decreased

CHEMICAL  REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY mm
3. Effect of Concentration
According  to Le Chatelier’s  principle,  any change  in the concentration  of a reactant  or
product  will lead to a change  in the concentration  of the substances  on the other side
of the equation.
If one of the reactants  is added to the equilibrium  mixture,  the system shifts to the
forward  direction  and a high yield of product  is obtained.  To the contrary,  if more
product  is added to the system,  the equilibrium  shifts to the reverse  direction.  For
example,  in the reaction,
N, + 3H, == 2NH,
If the concentration  of N, or H, is increased  (1.e., if more N, or H, is added),  the
equilibrium  will shift to the right direction  and more NH, will be produced.
4. Effect of catalysts
Catalysts  change the speed of both the forward and reverse reactions  equally.
However,  catalysts  do not affect the state of chemical  equilibrium  of a reaction.  This
means that the position  of equilibrium  will not be shifted due to the presence  of a
catalyst.
How can Le-Chatelier’s  principle  help in maximizing  the yields of  products
in industrial  production?
Many industrial  reactions  are reversible  reactions.  The Haber and contact  processes
provide  excellent  illustrations  of the effects of temperature,  pressure  and catalyst  on
the equilibrium  systems.
A Haber process (the industrial  production  of ammonia).  In the Haber
process,  ammonia  (NH) is industrially  manufactured  using gaseous  nitrogen
and hydrogen.
tN,(g) + 3H, = 2NH,(g);  AH = — 92 kJ/mol
High yield of ammonia  is produced  by decreasing  the temperature  and
increasing  the pressure  of the system.
However,  the yield per unit time is highly increased  by using an iron catalyst.
B Contact  process  (the industrial  production  of sulphuric  acid). Similarly,  in
the contact  process,  sulphuric  acid (H,SO,)  is commercially  manufactured  by
the reaction  of SO, and O,. The resulting  SO, is then converted  to H,SO,.

5.1INTRODUCTION
Competencies
By the end of this section,  you will be able to:
¢ Name the three physical  states of matter.
Activity  5.1
Discuss  each of the following  in your group and present  your discussion  to the class.
1. Name two examples  for each of solids, liquids and gases.
2. What happens  when you heat an ice cube?
You recall that all object around  us is called matter. Matter  is defined  as anything  that
occupies  space and has mass. It can exist in the form of gas, liquid and solid. The
simplest  example  is the water we use in our daily life. The three physical  states of
water are:
¢ Steam, water in the form of gas.
¢ Water, in the form of liquid.
¢ Ice, water in the form of solid.
The changes  of the states of matter are our every day experience.  That is, ice melts
and water freezes;  water boils and steam condenses.
The physical  state of a given sample of matter depends  on the temperature  and
pressure.  Changing  these conditions  or variables  may change  the behaviour  of the
substances  as solids, liquids or gases.
Solid
A solid has a definite  shape and a definite  volume.  Solids are almost completely
incompressible  and have very high average  density. A high average  density  reflects  the
fact that the particles  within solids are usually  packed  closer than those in liquids or
gases do. The tightly packed  particles  of solids are also highly organized.
The particles  of a solid, whether  they are atoms, ions or molecules  only vibrate about
a fixed point with respect  to the neighboring  particles.  Because  of these, the particles
maintain  a fixed position;  for example  substances  like metals,  wood, coal and stone,
are solids.
mx?¢  _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
Liquid
A liquid has a definite  volume,  but does not have a definite  shape. Liquids  take the
shape of their container.  This is explained  in terms of arrangement  of particles.  In the
liquid state, particles  vibrate about a point, and constantly  shift their positions  relative
to their neighbours.  At room temperature,  water, ethanol,  benzene  and oil are liquids.
Gas
A gas has neither  a definite  shape nor a definite  volume.  This is because  its particles
are virtually  independent  of one another.  For example,  air, hydrogen,  oxygen,  carbon
dioxide  and nitrogen  are gases.
Plasma
Besides,  solid, liquid and gas, there exists a fourth-state  of matter at very high
temperature  (million  degrees  Celsius).  At such high temperatures  molecules  cannot
exist. Most or all of the atoms are stripped  of their electrons.  This state of matter, a
gaseous  mixture  of positive  ions and electrons,  is called plasma.  Because  of the
extreme  temperatures  needed  for fusion, no material  can exist in the plasma  state.

2. In which state do the particles  possess  the highest  kinetic energy?
The three states of matter in which substances  are chemically  the same but physically
different  are explained  by the kinetic  theory of matter. The kinetic  theory of matter  gives
an explanation  of the nature of the motion  and the heat energy.  According  to the kinetic
theory of matter, every substance  consists  of a very large number  of very small particles
called ions, atoms and molecules.  The particles  are in a state of continuous  and random
motion  with all possible  velocities.  The motion  of the particles  increases  with  a rise in
temperature.
Generally,  the kinetic  theory of matter is based on the following  three assumptions:
1. All matter is composed  of particles  which are in constant  motion.
2. The particles  possess  kinetic energy and potential  energy.
3. The difference  between  the three states of matter is due to their energy contents
and the motion  of the particles.

1. Compare  and contrast  the density  of solid, liquid and gaseous  forms of a substance.
2. Discuss  the compressibility  of solid, liquid and gaseous  forms of water.
@ cHemistaveraDES
As discussed  earlier, matter exists as gas, liquid, and solid. Their properties  are
explained  in terms of the kinetic  theory as follows:
Properties  of Gases
From the kinetic  molecular  theory of gases, the following  general  properties  of gases
can be summarized.
1.Gases have no definite  shape and definite  volume.  This is because  gases assume
the volume  and shape of their containers.
Gases can be easily compressed.  By applying  pressure  to the walls of a flexible
container,  gases can be compressed;  the compression  results in a decrease  in
volume.  This happens  due to the large spaces between  the particles  of gases.
Gases have low densities  compared  with liquids and solids. This is due to the
fact that the particles  of a gas are very far apart and the number  of molecules
per unit volume  is very small. A small mass of a gas in a large volume  results in
a very low density.
Gases exert pressure  in all directions.  Gases that are confined  in a container
exert pressure  on the walls of their container.  This pressure  is due to collisions
between  gas molecules  and the walls of the container.
Gases easily flow and diffuse  through  one another. A gas moves freely and
randomly  throughout  in a given space.
Properties  of Liquids
Liquids  can be characterized  by the following  properties.
I.Liquids  have a definite  volume,  but have no definite  shape. They assume  the
shapes of their container.  Lack of a definite  shape for liquid substances  arises
from its low intermolecular  forces as compared  to that of solids.
Liquids  have higher densities  than gases. Their density is a result of the close
arrangement  of liquid particles.  Thus, the particles  of liquids are closer than
those of gases. This accounts  for the higher densities  of liquids as compared  to
gases.
Liquids  are slightly  compressible.  With very little free spaces between  their particles
liquids resist an applied  external  force and thus are compressed  very slightly.
Liquids  are fluids. A fluid is a substance  that can easily flow. Most liquids naturally
flow downhill  because  of gravity.  Because  liquids flow readily  the molecules  of
a liquid can mix with each other. They flow much more slowly  than gases.
Properties  of Solids
1.Solids have a definite  shape and a definite  volume.  This is due to the strong
force of attraction  that holds the particles  of solids together.
PHYSICALSTATESOF MATTER —
2.Solids generally  have higher densities  than gases and liquids. The particles  of
solids are very close to each other. There is almost  no empty space between
the particles  of solids. This closeness  of particles  makes solids to have more
particles  (mass) per unit volume,  and hence solids have high density.
Solids are extremely  difficult  to compress.  This is because  of the high interparticle
forces, and a very short distance  between  the particles.
Solids are not fluids. That is they normally  do not flow. This is due to the fact
that solid particles  are rigidly held in position  by strong forces that cause the
restricted  motion  of their particles.

Regarding  the pressure  in the tyres, what would you recommend  to the driver of a car
who is taking a trip to an area that is experiencing  very cold temperatures,  more or less
air? Explain.
The particles  in an ideal gas are very widely spaced and they are in a constant
random  motion.  The pressure  of a gas is the result of continuous  collisions  between
the particles  and the walls of their container.
170
— RYSICAL STATES OF MATTER >
Assumptions  of the kinetic molecular  theory of gases
1. The particles  are in a state of constant,  continuous,  rapid, random  motion  and,
therefore,  possess  kinetic  energy. The motion  is constantly  interrupted  by collisions
with molecules  or with the container.  The pressure  of a gas is the effect of these
molecular  impacts.
2. The volume  of the particles  is negligible  compared  to the total volume  of the
gas. Gases are composed  of separate,  tiny invisible  particles  called molecules.
Since these molecules  are so far apart, the total volume  of the molecules  is
extremely  small compared  with the total volume  of the gas. Therefore,  under
ordinary  conditions,  the gas consists  chiefly  of empty space. This assumption
explains  why gases are so easily compressed  and why they can mix so readily.
3. The attractive  forces between  the particles  are negligible.  There are no forces of
attraction  or repulsion  between  gas particles.  You can think of an ideal gas
molecule  as behaving  like small billiard  balls. When they collide,  they do not
stick together  but immediately  bounce  apart.
4. The average  kinetic energy of gas particles  depends  on the temperature  of the
gas. At any particular  moment,  the molecules  in a gas have different  velocities.
The mathematical  formula  for kinetic energy is K.E. = /% mv7, where m is mass
and v is velocity  of gas molecules.  Because  the molecules  have different  velocities,
they have different  kinetic energies.  However,  it is assumed  that the average
kinetic energy of the molecules  is directly  proportional  to the absolute  (Kelvin)
temperature  of the gas.

The gas laws are the products  of many experiments  on the physical  properties  of
gases, which were carried out over hundreds  of years. The observation  of Boyle and
other scientists  led to the development  of the Gas Laws. The gas laws express
mathematical  relationships  between  the volume,  temperature,  pressure,  and quantity  of
a gas.
Pressure:  pressure  is defined  as the force applied  per unit area.
Force
Pressure  =
Area
Pressure  is one of the measurable  properties  of gases. Thus, the pressure  of a gas can
be expressed  in unit of atmosphere,  Pascal,  torr, millimetre  of mercury.  The SI unit of
pressure  is Pascal (Pa), and is defined  as one Newton  per square metre.
1 Pa = 1 N/m? and
1 atm = 760 mmHg = 76 cmHg = 760 torr = 101325 Pa = 101.325  kPa
Volume:  Volume  is the space taken up by a body. The SI unit of volume  is the cubic
metre (m?). Volume  is also expressed  in cubic centimetre  (cm?) and cubic decimetre
(dm). Other common  units of volume  are millilitre  (mL) and litre (L).
1 cm? = (1x10?  m)? = 1«10°° m?
1 dm? = (1x107!  mj = 1x107 m? = 1 L
A litre is equivalent  to one cubic decimeter:  The relation  is given as follows
1 L= 1000 mL = 1000 cm? = 1 dm?
Temperature:  Temperature  is the degree of hotness  or coldness  of a body. Three
temperature  scales are commonly  used. These are °F (degree  Fahrenheit),  °C (degree
Celsius) and K (Kelvin).  In all gas calculations,  we use the Kelvin scale of
temperature.
We use the following  formulae  for all necessary  inter-conversions:
K = °C + 273

Molar Volume  and Standard  Conditions  (STP)
The conditions  of a pressure  of 1 atmosphere  and a temperature  of 0°C (273.14  K)
are called standard  temperature  and pressure  or STP for gases. At STP the volume  of
one mole of any gas is equal to 22.4 litres. This volume is known as molar gas
volume.
Quantity  of gas: The quantity  of a gas is expressed  in mole (7). Mole is the quantity
of gas in terms of number  of particles.  It is the number  of atoms or molecules  in
| gram-atom  or | gram-molecule  of an element  or a compound.

Explain why a helium weather  balloon  expands  as it rises more in the air. (Assume  the

The first quantitative  experiments  on gases were performed  by the Irish chemist,
Robert Boyle (1627-1691).  His experiment  helped to analyze the relationship
between  the volume  and pressure  of a fixed amount  of a gas at constant  temperature.
Decreasing  the external  pressure,  causes the gas to expand  and to increase  in volume.
Correspondingly,  increasing  the external  pressure  allows the gas to contract  and
decrease  in volume.  This is shown in Figure 5.1,

The French  physicist,  Jacques  Charles  (1746-1823),  was the first person  to fill a
balloon  with hydrogen  gas and made the first solo balloon  flight.
In 1787, Jacques  Charles  investigated  quantitative  relationship  between  the volume
and temperature  of a fixed quantity  of gas which is held at constant  pressure.
This can be related  to real life by using an empty  balloon.  Accordingly,  if we take a
balloon  filled with air and place it on boiling  water, the volume  of the balloon  visibly
increases  as shown  in Figure 5.4(b). If we take the balloon  and place it in the freezer

compartment  of our refrigerator,  its volume  shrinks drastically  as the air inside cools
(Figure  5.4(c)).

From your observation  what can you conclude  about the effect of temperature
on the volume of a gas?
In 1848, Lord Kelvin realized  that a temperature  of -273.15°C  is considered  as
absolute  zero. Absolute  zero is theoretically  the lowest attainable  temperature.  Then he
set up an absolute  temperature  scale, or the Kelvin  temperature  scale, with absolute
zero as the starting  point on the Kelvin scale.
The average kinetic energy of gas molecules  is closely related to the Kelvin
temperature.  The volume  of a gas and Kelvin  temperature  are directly  proportional  to
each other. For example,  doubling  the Kelvin  temperature  causes the volume  of a gas
to double, and reducing  the Kelvin  temperature  by half causes the volume  of a gas to
decrease  by half. This relationship  between  Kelvin  temperature  and the volume  of a
gas is known  as Charles’  law.
Charles’  law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant  pressure
varies directly  with the Kelvin temperature.

Charles  found that the volume  of a gas at constant  pressure  increases  linearly  with
the temperature  of the gas. That is, a plot of the volume of a gas versus its
temperature  (K) gives a straight  line assuming  the pressure  remains constant.
Figure 5.5 illustrates  the relationship  between  the volume  of a gas and Kelvin
temperature.  If the graph is extrapolated  to give zero volume for a gas, the
temperature  reached  is —273.15°C.  This temperature  is the lowest temperature

A sample of a gas often undergoes  changes  in temperature,  pressure,  and volume.
When this happens,  the three variables  must be dealt with at the same time.
Boyle’s  law and Charles’  law can be combined  to give one expression  called the
combined  gas law. The combined  gas law expresses  the relationship  between
pressure,  volume,  and temperature  of a fixed amount  of gas.
Derivation  of the combined  gas law:

The relationship  between  the volume  of a gas and its number  of molecules  was
explained  by Avogadro.  Avogadro’s  law states that equal volumes  of different
gases, under the same conditions  of temperature  and pressure,  contain  the same
number  of molecules.  Thus, according  to the law the volume  of a gas is proportional
to the number  of molecules  (moles)  of the gas at STP.

An ideal gas is a hypothetical  gas that obeys the gas laws. Real gases only obey the
ideal gas laws closely at high temperature  and low pressure.  Under these conditions,
their particles  are very far apart. The ideal gas law is a combination  of Boyle’s  law,
Charles’  law and Avogadro’s  law.
We have considered  the three laws that describe  the behavior  of gases as revealed  by
experimental  observations:
Boyle's  law: V @ (at constant  T and n)
Charles'  law: V a T (at constant  P and n)
Avogadro's  law: V a n (at constant  P and T)
This relationship  indicates  how the volume  of gas depends  on pressure,  temperature
and number  of moles.

(Hint: A balloon  has many  invisible  pinholes).
We have seen that a gas tends to expand  and occupy  any space available  to it. This
spreading  of gas molecules  is called diffusion.
How do you compare  the rate of diffusion  of molecules  with different
densities?
Thomas  Graham  (1805 - 1869), an English  chemist,  studied  the rate of diffusion  of
different  gases. He found that gases having  low densities  diffuse faster than gases with
high densities.  He was able to describe  quantitatively  the relationship  between  the
density  of a gas and its rate of diffusion.  In 1829, he announced  what is known as
Graham's  law of diffusion.
Graham’s  law of diffusion  states that at constant  temperature  and  pressure,  the rate
of diffusion  of a gas, r, is inversely  proportional  to the square root of its density,
d, or molar mass, M.
Mathematically  it can be expressed  as:
1 [1 .re —_— or re —>

As in a gas, particles  in a liquid are in constant  motion.  However,  the particles  in a
liquid are closer together  than those in a gas. The attractive  forces between  particles
in a liquid are more effective  than between  particles  in a gas. This attraction  between
liquid particles  is caused  by the intermolecular  forces (dipole-dipole  forces, London
dispersion  forces, and hydrogen  bonding).
Liquids  are more ordered  than gases because  of the stronger  intermolecular  forces
and the lower mobility  of liquid particles.  Accordingly,  liquid particles  are not bound
together  in fixed positions.
Energy Changes  in Liquids
Activity  5.16
Form a group and discuss  the following  phenomenon:
When you take bath with hot water in your bathroom,  the water collects  on the mirror of
the bathroom.
Present  your discussion  to the class.
The process  by which  a liquid changes  to a gas is known  as vaporization.  Evaporation
is the process  by which liquid molecules  break freely from the liquid surface  and enter
the vapor phase. Evaporation  is explained  in terms of the energy possessed  by the
molecules  on the surface of the liquid.
— RYSICAL  STATES OF MATTER >
In an open container,  evaporation  continues  until all of the liquid enters the vapor
phase. However,  liquids in a closed container  behave  differently.  The volume  of the
liquid decreases  for a period of time, and remains  unchanged.  In closed containers,
the vapor cannot  escape.  As the vapor concentration  increases,  some of the vapor
molecules  lose energy and return to the liquid state. When a vapor returns to the
liquid state, it is said to condense.  The process  is called condensation.  Evaporation
and condensation  are opposing  processes.
Evaporation
Liquid ~ Gas
Condensation
The rate of evaporation  of a liquid depends  on three factors. These are temperature,
intermolecular  forces, and surface  area of the liquid.
An increase  in temperature  increases  the average  kinetic energy  of the molecules  and
this increases  the tendency  to change into the gaseous  state. Some liquids evaporate
readily at room temperature.  Such liquids are said to be volatile.  The volatile  liquids
have relatively  weak forces of attraction  between  particles.  Diethyl  ether, ethyl alcohol,
benzene  and acetone  are volatile  liquids.
Non-volatile  liquids have  a little tendency  to evaporate  at a given temperature.  They
have relatively  stronger  attractive  forces between  their molecules,  e.g., sulphuric  acid,
water, and molten  ionic compounds.
Vapour  pressure:  The partial pressure  of the vapour  above  a liquid is called vapour
pressure.  The vapour  pressure  of a liquid depends  up on the temperature.  At a given
temperature,  vapour  pressure  is constant.  As the temperature  increases,  the vapour
pressure  of a liquid also increases  due to high rate of evaporation.
Vapour  pressure  depends  also on the strength  of the intermolecular  forces between
the particles  of the liquid. The stronger  the intermolecular  forces, the lower the vapour
pressure  will be, because  fewer particles  will have enough  kinetic  energy  to overcome
the attractive  force at a given temperature.  For example,  water and alcohol  have
relatively  low vapour  pressure.  On the contrary,  liquids  with low intermolecular  forces
have high vapour  pressures  at room temperature.  For example,  diethyl ether, a non-
polar molecule  with relatively  weak dispersion  forces, has a relatively  higher  vapour
pressure.

Boiling  and Boiling  Point
Activity  5.17
Form a group and discuss  the following  ideas. Present  your discussion  to the class.
1. How does the kinetic-molecular  theory  explain  why atmospheric  pressure  is greater  at
lower altitude  than at a higher  altitude?
2. Ice melts normally  at 0°C. What happens  to the melting  point of ice in the presence  of
impurities?  Does it melt below 0°C, above 0°C or exactly  at 0°C? Explain.
What is the difference  between  evaporation  and boiling?  How does boiling
point depend  on the external  pressure?
Boiling  is the change of a liquid to bubbles  of vapour  that appear  throughout  the
liquids. It is the conversion  of liquid to vapour  within the liquid as well as at its
surface. It occurs when the equilibrium  vapour  pressure  of the liquid equals the
atmospheric  pressure.  During  evaporation  only molecules  at the surface  escape into
the vapour  phase, but at the boiling  point the molecules  within  the liquid have sufficient
energy  to overcome  the intermolecular  attractive  forces of their neighbors,  so bubbles
of vapour  are released  at the surface.  It is the formation  of vapour  bubbles  within  the
liquid itself  that characterizes  boiling  and distinguishes  it from evaporation.
If the temperature  of the liquid is increased,  the equilibrium  vapour  pressure  also
increases.  Finally,  the boiling  point is reached.  The boiling  point of a liquid is the
temperature  at which the equilibrium  vapour pressure  of the liquid equals the
atmospheric  pressure.  Therefore,  the lower the atmospheric  pressure,  the lower the
boiling  point will be.
The boiling point of a liquid can be reduced  as lowering  the external  pressure,
because  the vapour  pressure  of the liquid equals the external  pressure  at a lower
temperature.
If the external  pressure  is 1.0 atmosphere  (760 mmHg),  the boiling  point is called
normal  boiling  point. For instance  water boils, at 100°C at 1.0 atmospheric  pressure.
Thus, the normal  boiling  point of water is 100°C.
Where will water boil first? In Addis Ababa or Hawassa?  Why?

— RHYSICALSTATESOF  MATTER —
Boiling  of a liquid requires  a certain  amount  of heat energy  to break the forces of
attraction  that holds the molecules  together.  The amount  of heat energy  necessary  to
bring about the vaporization  of a fixed amount  of a liquid at a fixed temperature  to the
gaseous  state is called the heat of vaporization.  For example,  the heat of vaporization
per mole of water at 298 K and 1 atmosphere  is 44.0 kJ. This is called the molar
heat of vaporization  (AM, a») of water.
Molar heat of vaporization  (AMZ...) and molar heat of condensation  (A//,ong) are
equal in magnitude  but opposite  in sign, i.e., AF ay =— AH,,.q- Vaporization  is an
endothermic  processes  where as condensation  is an exothermic  process.

@ cHemistaveraDES
Whena solid is continuously  heated its ordered  crystalline  structure  is disturbed.  The
particles  attain their freedom  of motion  gradually  and melting  (or fusion)  takes place
where the solid is converted  into the liquid state. The temperature  at which a
crystalline  solid is converted  to a liquid is known  as the melting  point.
In contrast  when  a liquid is cooled,  the molecules  become  closer and closer, and the
intermolecular  forces of attraction  become  stronger  and stronger.  The particles  arrange
themselves  into a regular  pattern in the liquid. This process is called freezing  or
solidification.  Note that the freezing  point of a liquid is the same as the melting  point of
a crystalline  solid. This means that:
¢ Both melting  and freezing  take place at the same temperature.
¢ Both liquid and solid phases coexist  at equilibrium  with each other at the melting
or freezing  point.
To clarify  this, let us consider  ice, which melts at 0°C and water freezes at 0°C. Ice
and water coexist  in equilibrium  with each other at 0°C as follows.
melting  ,O°C
Ice Liquid  water
freezing  ,0°C
The amount  of heat needed  to convert  one gram of a solid to a liquid at the melting
point is called heat of fusion. The molar heat of fusion or molar enthalpy  of fusion
(AH,.) is the quantity  of heat needed  to convert  one mole of a solid at its melting
point to the liquid state. For example,  the molar heat of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ at
0°C. This is the amount  of energy  needed  to break the attractive  forces in the solid at
the melting  point. Melting  requires  the supply of energy;  therefore,  it is an endothermic
process.
During  the process  of solidification,  an amount  of heat equal to the heat of fusion must
be liberated.  This quantity  of heat liberated,  which is exactly  equal to the heat of
fusion, is called the heat of solidification  or heat of crystallization.
The molar heat of crystallization  (AM a yst) is the quantity  of energy that must be
removed  from one mole of a liquid to convert  it to the solid state at its freezing  point.
AH, = —AH,cryst fus
Although  the motion  of the particles  in a solid are more restricted  than those in a
liquid, many solids have a significant  vapour  pressure  and evaporate  directly  from the
solid to the vapour  state without  passing  through  the liquid state. This process  is called
sublimation.

asic STATES OF MATTER
During  the sublimation  process  heat energy is absorbed.  That is, it is an endothermic
process.
Molar heat of sublimation  (AH,.) is the quantity  of heat required  to convert  one mole
of a solid to a gas at its sublimation  point. The heat (enthalpy)  of sublimation  is related
to the enthalpies  of fusion and vaporization  by:
AH = AH  ys + AH apsub fus
Phase Changes  and Energy  Changes  in Solids
A phase is any part of a system  that has uniform  composition  and properties.  A state
of matter represents  a phase. Most solid substances  undergo  two changes  of state
when heated.  A solid change  to a liquid at the melting  point, and the liquid changes  to
vapour  at the boiling  point. To understand  state changes,  we will consider  the heating
curve for a substance  given in Figure 5.10.
A heating  curve is a plot of temperature  verses the uniform  addition  of heat. This can
be illustrated  for a hypothetical  substance,  in which the temperature  of the substance  is
on the vertical axis and the passage of time during which heat is added to the
substance  is on the horizontal  axis. Figure 5.10 shows the changes  in the temperature
and phases of a pure substance  as it is heated,  beginning  with a solid and continuing
to the gaseous  state as described.

Initially,  the substance  exists in the solid state, and the addition  of heat increases  its
temperature.  When the solid is heated, its temperature  rises (A to B) until it reaches
the melting  point (point B), and the temperature  remains  constant  (B to C) until all the
197
@  cHemistaveraDES
solid is converted  to a liquid (point C). The added heat energy is used to break the
intermolecular  forces,  thus disrupting  the solid structure.  At point C phase change is
completed.  Once melting  is completed,  heating  of the liquid raises its temperature
(C to D) until the boiling  point is reached  at point D. In region (D to E) the addition
of heat is utilized  to break the intermolecular  forces of the liquid to change it to a gas.
When all the liquid has been converted  into a gas, addition  of heat simply  raises the
temperature  of the gas.

¢ A liquid has no definite  shape, it takes the shape of its container.
¢ A gas has neither  a definite  volume  nor a definite  shape.
¢ Gases and liquids  are fluids where as solids are not. Fluidity  is the tendency
to flow.
¢ When energy is supplied  to a solid, it melts and changes  to a liquid, the
particles  move  faster. Additional  energy  will make the liquid  boil and  form
a gas.
¢ In the gas the particles  are much more widely spaced and move much
faster than in liquid and solid.

Historical  Notes
Friedrich  Wohler
In 1828 German chemist, Friedrich  Wohler converted
ammonium  cyanate,  an inorganic  compound,  into the organic
substance  urea. Wohler’s  discovery  revolutionized  the study of
chemistry  by redefining  the manner in which chemists
distinguished  between  inorganic  and organic  compounds.  He is
also credited  for his work in isolating  the elements  aluminium
and beryllium.

animals  and plants’?Friedrich  Wohler
2. Draw diagrams to show how carbon  atomscan  link to one another  in different  waysto

Discuss  with your group and present  it to the class.
History  of Organic  Chemistry
Before  the beginning  of  the nineteenth  century,  chemists  classified  compounds  into two
classes;  organic  and inorganic.  Those  derived  from  living  things  (plants  and animals)  were
classified  as organic  compounds,  while  those  that came from  mineral  constituents  of the
earth or were found  with non-living  things  are classified  as inorganic  compounds.
What  was the basis of  this classification?  Early  chemists  believed  that organic  compounds
differed  from inorganic  compounds  because  living  things  had a special  ‘life force’  within
them,  which  was invisible  and hard  to detect.  According  to the theory  of ‘life force’,  the
only source  of organic  compounds  was nature  itself  (plants  and animals).  It was thought
impossible  to synthesize  them in the laboratory.  This was because  man could  not add or
create  the ‘life force’ within  them.
The belief  in the ‘life force’  theory  continued  until Friedrich  Wohler  synthesized  urea  for
the first time in 1828. In attempting  to prepare  ammonium  cyanate,  NH,CNO,  from  the
reaction  of silver  cyanate,  AgCNO,  and ammonium  chloride,  NH_CI,  he accidentally
and surprisingly  obtained  urea, (NH,),CO:
AgCNO(aq)  + NH,Cl(aq)  — AgCl(s) + NH,CNO(aq)
O
|
NH,CNO  (aq) "> HN — C — HN (s)
Urea
Urea  was the first organic  compound  synthesized  in the laboratory.  The synthesis  of
urea  by Friedrich  Wohler  and subsequent  synthesis  of other  organic  compounds  marked
the downfall  of  the ‘life force’  theory.
How do you explain  organic  compounds  at present  and define  organic  chemistry?
The common  feature  of  organic  compounds  is that  they all contain  the element  carbon.  Organic
compounds  are the compounds  of carbon  found  in and derived  from plants  and animals.
They also include  those substances  synthesized  in laboratories  except  the oxides  of carbon,
carbonates,  hydrogen  carbonates,  cyanides  and cyanates.
Besides  carbon,  these compounds  contain  a few other  elements  such as hydrogen,  oxygen,
nitrogen,  sulphur,  halogens  and phosphorus.  The branch  of chemistry  that studies  carbon
compounds  is called  organic  chemistry.  This branch  of chemistry  was developed,  starting
from  the theory  of ‘life force’ to the era in which  synthetic  organic  compounds  are used in
our daily lives. The number  of inorganic  compounds  discovered  and prepared  may be in the
region  of some  hundred  thousand.  At present,  millions  of organic  compounds  have been
discovered,  synthesized,  and used.
— @— Gtewsteverve10
The main  reason  for the presence  of millions  of carbon  compounds  is the unique  property
of carbon  called  catenation.  Catenation  is the ability  of atoms  of the same element  to join
together  forming  short  or long chains  and rings. A few other  elements  like sulphur,  silicon
and boron  show  this behaviour,  but to a much  lesser  extent.

structures  and observe  their difference?  Why do these compounds  have different

Organic  compounds  are generally  classified  based  on their functional  group.
What are functional  groups  and what groups  of organic  compounds  are known
on the basis of this classification?
The functional  group  is the part of amolecule  or a compound  that determines  the chemical
properties  of  that molecule  or compound.  This group  also determines  some of  the physical
properties  of a compound.  Based  on the functional  groups  they possess,  the most common
classification  of  organic  compounds  including  alkanes,  alkenes,  alkynes,  aromatics,  alcohols,
aldehydes,  ketones,  carboxylic  acids and esters.  The common  functional  groups  of some
organic  compounds  are given  in Table 1.1.

Discuss  with your group and present  it to the class.
What are hydrocarbons  and on what basis do we categorize  them?
Hydrocarbons  are organic  compounds  composed  of the elements  carbon  and hydrogen
only. Hydrocarbons  are subdivided  into two groups,  based  on the type of bonding  between
carbon  atoms,  as saturated  hydrocarbons  and unsaturated  hydrocarbons.
Saturated  Hydrocarbons  are those compounds  of carbon  and hydrogen  containing  only
carbon-carbon  single  bonds.  Methane,  ethane,  and propane  are typical  examples  of this
group.  Unsaturated  Hydrocarbons  are those compounds  of carbon  and hydrogen  possessing
one or more multiple  bonds (double  or triple bonds)  between  carbon  atoms.  Alkenes,
alkynes  and aromatic  hydrocarbons  are examples  of unsaturated  hydrocarbons.
A formula that shows  all the bonds  and atoms  is called  a detailed  structure.  The shorter
Structure  is called  condensed  structure.

Draw a graph using the information  in Table 1.2 by plotting  the number  of carbon atoms
of each compound  on one axis, and hydrogen  atoms  on the other. Predict the formulas  of
the saturated  hydrocarbons  containing  8,9 and 10 carbon  atoms  and complete  Table 1.2.
Discuss  with your group and present  it to the class.
Alkanes  are saturated  hydrocarbons.  They contain  chains  of carbon  atoms  linked  by single
bonds  only. Every  carbon  atom in the molecule  forms  four single  covalent  bonds  with other
atoms.  Alkanes  have the general  formula  CH,,,,where, n= 1, 2,3...  Using  this general
formula,  we can write the molecular  formula  of any alkane  containing  a specific  number  of
carbon  atoms.  For example,  the chemical  formulas  of alkanes  containing  one, two and three
carbon  atoms are C_H,.,,=CH,,  C,H =C,H,, and C,H =C.,H,, respectively.172x142 20° 2x2+2 2° 6? 3° 2x3 +2 3° 8?
When  we compare  the formulas  of CH, and C,H,  or C,H, and C,H,, they differ  by one
carbon  and two hydrogen  atoms  or—CH,—  group  called  the methylene  group. A group  of
compounds  in which  each member  of  the group differs  from the next member  by a—CH,,,
is called  a homologous  series. Compounds  in the same homologous  series can be represented
by the same general  formula.  The individual  members  of  the group  are called  homologues.
Alkanes  contain  carbon-carbon  single  bonds (— C — C —) as their functional  group.

1. What happens to the percentage  by mass of hydrogen  and the physical  state of alkanes
as the number  of carbon atoms  increase?
2. Categorize  the petroleum  related products  you encounter  everyday  as solids, liquids
and gases? Discuss  in your group and present  it to the class.
Doyou  know  which  alkanes  exist in the liquid, solid  or gaseous  state at room temperature?
What  types of  intermolecular forces  ofattraction  exist between  the molecules  ofalkanes?
Explain  why the boiling  points  and melting  points of alkanes  increase  with increasing
number  of carbon  atoms.
Atroom  temperature,  the first four alkanes,  methane  to butane,  are gases;  whereas  pentane
(C.H,,)  to heptadecane  (C,_H,,)  are liquids,  and the alkanes  containing  eighteen  and
more carbon  atoms  are solids.
Alkanes  are nonpolar  organic  compounds.  Weak  intermolecular  forces  called  Van der
Waal’s  forces  hold  their molecules  together.  The strength  of  these forces  increases  with the
— @— Giawstvormve10
increasing  surface  area (molecular  mass) of the alkanes.  Since alkanes  are non-polar,
they are almost  insoluble  in polar solvents  like water,  but, they are soluble  in non-polar
solvents  like benzene,  toluene,  ether and carbon  tetrachloride.
The density,  melting  point, and boiling  point  of  the homologous  series  of alkanes  increase
as the carbon  number  increases.  For alkanes  of  the same carbon  number,  branched-chain
isomers  have lower  boiling  points  than the straight-chain  (normal)  alkanes.  The reason  is,
as branching  increases,  there is a decrease  in surface area and the strength  of the
intermolecular  force,  which,  in turn, results  in a decrease  in boiling  point;  e.g., the boiling
points  of n-pentane,  iso-pentane  and neo-pentane  are 36°C,  28°C and 9.5°C,  respectively.
Alkanes  containing  all the carbon  atoms in one continuous  chain are called  normal  or
straight-chain  alkanes  and those containing  chains  with branches  are known  as branched-
chain  alkanes.
Example
In alkanes  (branched  or straight-chain)  each carbon  atom is tetrahedrally  bonded  to
four atoms  with a bond angle of 109.5°.

1. Why rules are important  for naming  organic  compounds?  Discuss  in your group some
of the rules you know for naming  organic  compounds  and present  it to your class.
2. In mathematics,  the names pentagon,  hexagon,  heptagon  and octagon  are used to
describe  polygons.  What does each of the prefixes-  pent, -hex, -hept and -oct indicate?
What is the significance  of these prefixes  in chemistry?  Discuss  in groups  and present
it to the class.
Organic  chemistry  uses a simplified  and systematic  way of  naming  organic  compounds.  The
names  of alkanes  and most  of  the organic  compounds  are derived  from:
i) aprefix-  indicating  the number  of carbon  atoms  (listed  in Table 1.3)and
ii) a-suffix  indicating  the type of the functional  group  present  in the molecule.
The following  table introduces  the prefixes  that are used to indicate  the presence  of one to
ten carbon  atoms  in the longest  continuous  carbon  chain.
Table 1.3 Prefixes  commonly  used to indicate  one to ten carbon  atoms.
Meth- One Hex- ax
Eh- Two Hept- Seven
Prop- Three Oct- Eight
But- Four Non- Nine
Pent- Five Dec- Ten
From  Table 1.2, you can note that the names  of all alkanes  contain  the suffix  ‘-ane’,  which
indicates  that their functional  group  is a carbon  — carbon  single  bond. Thus,  to name an
alkane,  you should  use the appropriate  prefix  that indicates  the number  of carbon  atoms  and
the suffix ‘-ane’.  For example,  to name  the alkane  C,H,  ,, use the prefix  “Hex’ that indicate
the presence  of six carbon  atoms  and add the suffix °-ane’ so that the name  becomes  hexane.
Activity  1.7
Practice  naming  alkanes  using first four prefixes  mentioned  in Table 1.3.ln naming  alkanes,
why are number  of carbon atoms  used as prefixes?  Discuss  in groups.
Common  Names of Alkanes
Lower  members  of  the alkane  homologous  series  have common  names.  The prefixes  used
in the common  names  are n- (normal),  “iso-’ and ‘neo-’.  The prefix  - is used when  all the
carbon  atoms  form a continuous  chain.
Example
H,C — CH, — CH, —CH,  — CH,
n-pentane
H,C — CH, — CH, —CH,  — CH, —CH,

Iso- is used when  all of the carbon  atoms  form a continuous  chain,  except  for the one
next to the last carbon.
Example
H,C — 1" — CH, H,C — CH, — 1 — CH,

~ INTRODUCTION  TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1) EE
IUPAC  System of Nomenclature  of Alkanes
It is difficult  to have common  names  for the more branched  and complex  alkanes.  In
naming  such alkanes,  the more systematic,  convenient  and appropriate  one is the
International  Union  of Pure and Applied  Chemistry  (IUPAC)  system. In order  to apply
this system,  it is very important  to know  the rules to be followed,  what alkyl radicals  are,
and how they are named.
Alkyl  radicals  are obtained  by removing  one hydrogen  atom from the corresponding
alkanes.  Their general  formula  is C,H,,,,,,  where n= 1, 2,3 .... The names  of alkyl
radicals  are derived  from  the names  of the corresponding  parent  alkanes  by changing  the
suffix  -ane to -yl.

The system  of naming  organic  compounds  is based  on the recommendations  of IUPAC.
The following  are the rules established  by IUPAC  to name  branched-chain  hydrocarbons.
@ cHemisteverADEID
1. Select  the longest  continuous  chain  of carbon  atoms in the molecule  as the  parent
structure.  The name of the straight-chain  alkane  possessing  the same number  of
carbon  atoms is used as the name of this longest  chain. The groups  attached  to the
parent  structure  are called  side chains  or substituents.
Example 1

| <«— Side chain
L.(CH, CH, — CH CH CH, CH, — CH Longest  continuousOe  PE  carbon chain

Side chain a
There  are seven  carbon  atoms  in the longest  chain  (the  parent  structure).  Therefore,  it
gets the name “heptane”.
2. Assign  numbers  to the carbon  atoms of the longest  chain starting  from one end to
the other so that the carbon  atoms  to which  side chains  are attached  get the lowest
possible  number.
CH,—  CH,
CH,—CH,  oH —‘CH —CH,  —CH,  —CH,
CH,
orCH,—  CH,
CH,—CH,  oH —‘CH — CH, —CH,— CH,
CH,
To check  which  direction  of  numbering  is correct;  add the locants  (numbers  assigned
to the carbon  atoms to which substituents  are attached).
The sum of locants  in the first case is 3 + 4=7 and in the second  case, 4+ 5 =9.
So numbering  should  be done from left to right in this case. Thus,  the first option  is
correct.
3. Indicate  the position  of the side chain  by using  the number  assigned  to the carbon
atom  to which  it is attached.  If the same substituents  appear  more than once, use the
© INTRODUCTIONTO  ORBANICCHEMISTEY  (UNIT1)
prefix  di-, tri-, tetra- etc. before  the name of the substituent  to show two, three,
four, etc. substituents,  respectively.
4. Numbers  are separated  from each other  by commas  while  they are separated  from
substituent  names  by hyphens.
5. Arrange  the names  of the side chains  before  the parent  name in alphabetical  order.
The complete  name  of  the alkane  given  in the above  example  will then be 4-ethyl-3-
methylheptane  (substituents  in alphabetical  order).
Example  2
CH, Cl CH,
i | = JHe —G —CH—  CCH

The longest  chain  has six carbon  atoms and the parent  name is hexane.  There are two
methyl  groups  at carbon-2  and another  two methyl  groups  on carbon-4  and one chlorine
atom at carbon-3.  Therefore,  the correct  name of the compound  ts 3-chloro-2,2,4,4-
tetramethylhexane.
Example  3

The longest  chain  contains  eight  carbon  atoms.  Hence,  the parent  name  of  the given  molecule
is octane.  There are three methyl  groups attached  to carbon  number  3, 4 and 6; one
bromine  atom is attached  to carbon-4  and two chlorine  atoms are attached  to carbon-3
and carbon-5.  Thus, the correct  name of the compound  is 4-bromo-3,5-dichloro-3,4,6-
trimethyloctane.
~ CHEMISTRY  GRADE10
Note:
When  F, Cl, Br and I appear  as substituents,  change  the names  fluorine,  chlorine,  bromine
and iodine  to fluoro,  chloro,  bromo  and iodo, respectively.
Example  4
CH, CH,

There are seven  carbon  atoms in the parent  structure,  so it takes the name heptane.  There
are two methyl  groups  at carbon-2  and two methyl  groups  at carbon-4  and carbon-5  and
one fluorine  at carbon-3.  So the name of the compound  1s 3-fluoro-2,2,4,5-tetramethy1

There  is only one possible  structure  for each of the first three alkanes,  namely,  methane
(CH,),  ethane  (C,H,)  and propane  (C,H,). Those  alkanes  containing  four or more carbon
atoms  have more than one structure.  The existence  of two or more chemical  compounds
with  the same molecular  formula  but different  structures  is called  isomerism.
The compounds  that have the same molecular  formula  but different  structures  are
called  isomers.  Alkanes  exhibit  a type of structural  isomerism  called  chain  or skeletal
isomerism.  These  structures  differ  in the arrangement  of the carbon  atoms  and hydrogen
atoms.  To understand  what isomers  are, consider  the isomers  of butane  (C,H,,) and
pentane  (C.H,,).
1. Isomers  of butane  (C,H,,)
Butane  has two isomers:
2. Isomers  of pentane  (C.H,,)
Pentane  has three isomers.
Alkanes  are the major  constituents  of  petroleum  and natural  gas. They are mainly  obtained
by fractional  distillation  of petroleum.  Alkanes  can also be prepared  in the laboratory.
Some  methods  of their  preparation  are as follows:
1. Hydrogenation  of alkenes  with a metal catalyst.
General  Reaction: R—-CH=CH, + H, a R— CH,—  CH,

2. Wirtz  Synthesis  (reaction).  This method  involves  the reaction  of a halogenated

3. Heating  sodium  salt of an organic  acid with soda  lime (mixture  ofsodium  hydroxide

Methane  can be produced  in a biogas  plant. The biogas  plant generates  biogas,  mainly
consisting  of  methane  by anaerobic  fermentation  of organic  materials  such as human  excreta,
animal  dung and agricultural  residue.
The conversion  of organic  materials  into biogas  involves  a sequence  of reactions  and is

Activity  1.11
Discuss  the following  points  in groups  and present  your opinions to the class.
1.Which chemical  property  of alkanes  is responsible  for generating  electricity  in diesel
power stations  or for moving  motor vehicles?  Name the major product  formed  when
the fuel has been consumed  in the diesel power station.
The reaction  of methane  with oxygen produces  two different  oxides  of carbon,  CO,
and CO.
1 What condition  determineswhether  the product  of the methane  reaction  isCO,  or CO?
b If adomestic  heating  system is fuelled by methane,  what difference  does it make
if the combustion  produces  CO, or CO?
Alkanes  are generally  not considered  to be very reactive  organic  compounds.  The name
paraffin  for alkanes  arose from  two Latin  words  ‘parum’  meaning  /itt/e and ‘affinis’  means
affinity.  Thus,  paraffin  means  little affinity.  This name  was suggested  because  alkanes  are
inert towards  many  reagents  like acids, bases,  oxidizing  and reducing  agents.  However,
they undergo  several  reactions  under  suitable  conditions.
The major  reactions  of alkanes  are the  following:
1.Combustion  Reactions:  Ifalkanes  are burned  with limited  supply  of oxygen,
they will form  water  and carbon  monoxide  and will liberate  lesser  amounts  of heat
energy.  Alkanes  burn in excess  oxygen  to form carbon  dioxide  and water,  liberating
a greater  amounts  of heat. The general  equation  for the reaction  is:
3nt+1CH.» + ( Jo, + nCO, + (n+1)H,O + heat
n~ 2n+2 2
where  n is the number  of carbon  atoms  in the alkane  molecule.
Example
C,H, + 50, > 3CO, + 4H,O + 2299kJ
The heat energy  liberated  is used  to generate  electricity,  to move  motor  vehicles  or
to cook our food.

1. Write the general  equation  for the combustion  of alkanes  in a limited supply  of oxygen
that forms  carbon monoxide,  water and energy.
2. Why is apetroleum  refinery  is built in the open air? Present  your opinion  to the class.
2. Substitution  Reaction:  This is a reaction  that involves  the replacement  of one
atom or a group  of atoms  by another  atom or group  of atoms.  Halogenation  of
alkanes  is avery  good example  of substitution  reaction.  This reaction  involves
reacting  alkanes  with chlorine  and bromine.  The reaction  of chlorine  and bromine
with alkanes  proceeds  in presence  of heat or sunlight.  This type of reaction  is
called  photochemical  reaction.  The reaction  of alkanes  with chlorine  and bromine
proceeds  in a sequence  of steps. For example,  let us consider  the photochemical
reaction  of methane  with chlorine  (chlorination):
i) Chain  Initiating  Step: This step involves  absorption  of energy  to generate
reactive  particles  known  as free radicals.  A free radical is an atom or a
group  of atoms  possessing  unpaired  electron.  A free radical  is electrically  neutral.
A chlorine  molecule  absorbs  light and decomposes  into two chlorine  atoms:
ci_cy 8th 2c.
ii) Chain  Propagating  Step: This is astep which  consumes  a reactive  particle  (free
radical)  produced  in the chain  initiation  step and generates  another  free radical.
Cl + CH, —> HCl + CH;
iii) Chain  Terminating  Step: In the chain  terminating  step reactive  particles  (free
radicals)  are consumed  but not generated.
CH,> + Cle —~> CHCl
In this step, “side reactions’  that do not lead to the formation  of  the desired  products
often take place.
Examples
Cl + Clk —> Cl,
CH, + CH, —> CH,—CH,
Such a detailed  step by step description  of a chemical  reaction  is called  a reaction
mechanism.

3. Elimination  reaction:  This type of  reaction  involves  the removal  of smaller  molecules
from a compound  and leads to the formation  of a compound  containing  a multiple
bond (unsaturated  compound).  It can also involve  the removal  of hydrogen  atoms
from adjacent  carbon  atoms  at relatively  high temperatures.

Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes  are saturated  hydrocarbons  in which  the carbon  atoms  are linked  in sucha
manner  as to form closed  chains  or ring structures.  They are represented  by the general
formula,  CH,,where  n 2 3. Cycloalkanes  are isomeric  with open-chain  alkenes.  Their
names  are obtained  by prefixing  “cyclo”  to the name of an alkane  containing  the same
number  of carbon  atoms.  The following  structures  represent  some  examples  of cycloalkanes.

Physical  Properties  of Alkenes
1. Why some alkenes  exist in gaseous  and liquid states  at room temperature?
2. The melting points, boiling points and densities  of alkenes  increase  with increasing
number  of carbon atoms;  why?
3. Are alkenes  coloured  compounds?  Do they have smell?
Discuss  with your group and present  it to the class.
At room temperature,  alkenes  containing  two to four carbon  atoms are gases. Those
containing  five to seventeen  carbon  atoms are liquids,  and those containing  eighteen  or
more carbon  atoms are solids.
Alkenes  are non-polar.  Therefore,  their  molecules  are held together  by weak  inter-molecular
forces.  Since  they are non-polar,  they are almost  insoluble  in polar solvents  like water,  but
soluble  in non-polar  solvents  like ether, benzene,  toluene  and carbon  tetrachloride.
Nomenclature  of Alkenes
Alkenes  can have common  names  as well as IUPAC  names.  The common  names  of alkenes
are obtained  by using  the prefixes  in Table 1.3 and adding  the suffix ‘-ylene’:

e Which name do you think is more appropriate  for the longest chain of carbon

your group and present  to the class.
The IUPAC  names  of alkenes  are obtained  by using  the prefixes  listed in Table 1.3 to
indicate  the number  of carbon  atoms in the molecule  and adding  the suffix ‘-ene’. The
suffix ‘-ene’ indicates  the presence  of a double  bond. For example,  the alkene  having  the
formula  C,H, is named  as octene.  The prefix  oct- indicates  that there are eight carbon
atoms in the molecule  and ‘-ene’ signifies  the presence  of a double  bond.
In the IUPAC  system  of naming  alkenes,  the rules we follow  are similar  to those rules we
follow  for naming  alkanes  with slight  modifications.  These  are:
1. Select  the longest  continuous  chain  of carbon  atoms  in the molecule  that includes  the
double  bond as a parent  structure.  Its name  will be the same as the alkene  containing

TIsomerism  in Alkenes
Alkenes  containing  two and three carbon  atoms  have only one possible  structure.  Alkenes
containing  four or more carbon  atoms  exhibit  isomerism.  Alkenes  show  the following  three
types of isomerism:
1.Chain  isomerism:  This is due to the difference  in the arrangement  of the carbon
atoms  in the longest  continuous  carbon  chain.
Position  isomerism:  This is due to the difference  in the position  of  the double  bond
in the carbon  chain.
Example
Consider  the following  compounds  with  the same molecular  formula  (C.H,,):
— @—Giawstvormve10
Compounds  (a) and (b) represent  the position  isomers  of pentene,  (c) and (d) are
position  isomers  of methylbutene,  (a), (c) and (e) are the chain isomers,  while all
these compounds  are the isomers  of C,H...
3. Geometrical  isomerism.  This results  from the difference  in the relative  spatial
arrangement  of atoms  or groups  about  the double  bond. This isomerism  exists  because
free rotation  about  the double  bond is not possible.  To differentiate  geometrical
isomers,  we use the prefix  ‘cis’ if two similar  groups  are on the same side of the
double  bond and ‘trans’  when  the two similar  groups  are on opposite  sides of it;
‘cis’ means  the same and ‘trans’  means  across.

Chemical  properties  of Alkenes
Alkenes  are unsaturated  hydrocarbons  containing  double  bond (a strong  bond and a weak
bond)  between  the two carbon  atoms.  They are more reactive  than alkanes,  because  the
weak  bond can be used for further  reaction.  They undergo  several  types of reactions.
1. Combustion  reaction.  Alkenes  burn in oxygen  with a luminous  flame  to form carbon
dioxide  and water.
3nGeneral reaction: C,H, + (=) O, — nCO, + nH,O + heat
Example
C,H,(g) + 60,(g) — 4CO,(g) + 4H,O(g) + heat
2. Addition  reaction.  Alkenes  undergo  mainly  addition  reactions.  The addition  occurs
at the carbon-carbon  double  bond.
a Addition  of halogens  (halogenation):  When  a halogen  molecule,  X,, (where,
X, = Cl, or Br,) is added  to alkenes,  the product  is a dihaloalkane.
General  reaction:
37
Example
If bromine  water  (bromine  in CCL) is added  to alkenes,  the reddish  brown
colour  of Br, in CCL, will disappear.  This is due to the addition  of bromine
(Br,) across  the double  bond. So, Br, in CCl, is used to detect  unsaturation
(presence  of multiple  bond)  in a compound.
b Addition  of hydrogen  (Hydrogenation):  Addition  of hydrogen  molecule  to

c Addition  of hydrogen  halides,  HX (hydrohalogenation):  Addition  ofhydrogen
halide  (HCI, HBr or HI) to alkenes  leads to the formation  of alkyl halides.  The
product  of the reaction  can be predicted  by Markovnikov’s  rule; which  states
that “when  an alkene  reacts  with a hydrogen  halide  to give an alkyl halide,  the
hydrogen  adds to the carbon  atom of  the double  bond  that has the greater  number
of hydrogen  atoms,  and the halogen  to the carbon  that has the fewer  number  of
hydrogen  atoms”.
The same is true when  an alkene  reacts  with  water  in an addition  reaction  to form
an alcohol.

Cycloalkenes
Cycloalkenes  are unsaturated  cyclic  hydrocarbons.  The carbon  atoms  are linked  in sucha
manner  as to form a closed  chain  or a ring structure.  They contain  a double  bond between
carbon  atoms and are represented  by the general  formula  CH,_,,  where  n should  be
equal to or greater  than 3. They are isomeric  with alkynes.  They are named  by prefixing
“cyclo”  to the name of alkenes  containing  the same number  of carbon  atoms.  The given
structures  show some examples  of cycloalkenes.
The IUPAC  names  for alkynes  are obtained  by using  the prefixes  listed  in Table 1.3. The
suffix  “-yne’ is added  to the prefixes,  which  indicates  the presence  of a triple bond  between  a
pair of adjacent  carbon  atoms.  Alkynes  are named  in the same way as alkenes.

Physical  Properties  of Alkynes
Alkynes  are non-polar  compounds  whose molecules  are held together  by weak
intermolecular  forces.  The strength  of the intermolecular  forces  increases  with increasing
molecular  size. The physical  properties  of alkynes  are almost  similar  to those of alkenes.

IUPAC  System:  The IUPAC  names  for alkynes  are obtained  by using  the prefixes  listed
in Table 1.3. The suffix *-yne’  is added  to the prefixes.  ‘-yne’  indicate  the presence  of a triple
bond between  a pair of adjacent  carbon  atoms.  Alkynes  are named  in the same way as
alkenes.

Chemical  Properties  of Alkynes
Alkynes  are more reactive  than alkanes  and alkenes.  Why?
Alkynes  are more unsaturated  than alkanes  and alkenes  due to the presence  of a carbon-
carbon  triple bond. They can undergo  combustion  and addition  reactions.
Some  of the common  reactions  of alkynes  are:
1.Combustion  reaction:  Alkynes  burn  with a smoky  luminous  flame,  forming  CO, and
water. Smoky  luminous  flames  result  from  the combustion  of alkynes  due to their high
carbon  content.

Discuss the following  in your group and present  it to the class:
1. What comes  to your mind when you hear the word “benzene”?
2. What is the word “aroma”  mean? Which substances  have an aroma  smell?
3. Are aromatic  hydrocarbons  unsaturated  as alkenes?  Why?
The term aromatic  is derived  from the word ‘aroma’  meaning  pleasant  smell,  which  was
originally  used  to describe  naturally  occurring  compounds  with pleasant  smells.  At present,
the term is used without  its original  significance.  Aromatic  hydrocarbons  are generally
obtained  from petroleum  and coal tar. They are a group  of hydrocarbons  characterized  by
the presence  of a benzene  ring or related structures.  Some examples  of aromatic
hydrocarbon  structures  are given  below:

Figure  1.9 Structures  of some Aromatic  Hydrocarbons.
Benzene  is the simplest  aromatic  hydrocarbon.  Its molecular  formula  is C,H,. Friedrich A.
Kekule,  in 1865, suggested  that the six carbon  atoms  of benzene  are arranged  in the shape
of ahexagon.  He also suggested  a resonance  hybrid  structure.  He represented  benzene  by
the resonance  structures  (Figure  1.10) in which  the two structures  shown  make equal
contribution  for the resonance  hybrid  or actual  structure.

Figure  1.10 Resonance  structures  of benzene.Resonance  hybrid
The bonds in benzene  are neither  single  nor double  but have an intermediate  character
between  those of single and double  bonds.  All the carbon-carbon  bonds  in the molecule
are same in length  and nature.  Since structure  I or II grven  above  are not the true structures
of  the benzene  molecule,  the benzene  ring is written,  in most  cases, in its resonance  hybrid
form as follows:
mux?
3 — &-O
The six electrons  in the hexagonal  ring are delocalized.
From structures  I and IT in Figure 1.10, one may think  that benzene  has three double
bonds and has the same chemistry  as that of alkenes.  But, this is not true. Benzene  and
other aromatic  hydrocarbons  are not as unsaturated  as alkenes  because  the three double
bonds in benzene  are delocalized  due to resonance.  They are more stable  than alkenes.
They  undergo  substitution  reactions  to a far greater  extent  than addition  reactions,  which  is
a different  characteristic  compared  to alkenes.
Physical  Properties  of Benzene
Benzene  is a flammable,  colourless,  and volatile  liquid  with a characteristic  smell. It is
nonpolar  and immiscible  with water  but miscible  with non-polar  solvents  like ether and
carbon  tetrachloride.  It freezes  at 5.4°C and boils at 80.4°C.  It is a carcinogenic  (cancer
causing)  substance.  Benzene  is a good solvent  for fats, gums,  rubber  etc., and is used in
the manufacture  of dyes, drugs and explosives.
Chemical  Properties  of Benzene
Benzene  and other  aromatic  hydrocarbons  are more stable  than alkenes  and alkynes  due to
the stability  of the aromatic  ring. It neither  decolorizes  bromine  water  (Br, in CCL) nor is
reactive  towards  cold potassium  permanganate  solution.  However,  benzene  undergoes
the following  reactions:
1. Combustion  reaction:  Benzene  1s highly  inflammable.  It burns  with a smoky  luminous
flame  to form CO, and H,O.
2C,H, + 150, — 12CO, + 6H,O + Heat
2. Substitution  reaction:  The reactions  of benzene  are chiefly  substitution  but not
addition  reactions.  In this reaction,  hydrogen  atom from  the benzene  ring is replaced
by another  atom or group.
a Halogenation:  Benzene  reacts  with bromine  and chlorine  in the presence  of
iron (IIT) chloride  or aluminium  chloride  catalyst  to form substitution  products.

Discuss the following  in your group and present  it to the class:
1. What do you think is the major component  of natural gas?
2. How can petroleum  be separated  into different  fractions?
3. How are natural gas, petroleum  and coal formed in nature?  Can they be recycled?
A. Natural  Gas
The principal  sources  of hydrocarbons  are natural  gas, crude oil and coal. Natural  gas is
found  in association  with petroleum  or alone.  It is found  in underground  deposits  several
hundreds  or thousands  ofmetres  below  the earth’s  surface,  where  it originated  from  the decay
and decomposition  of animal  and plant  remains  millions  of years ago. Natural  gas mainly
contains  methane  (more  than 90%),  ethane,  propane,  butane  and small quantities  of higher
alkanes.  Other  gases such as, CO,, N,, O, and H,S, may also be present  in natural  gas.
The composition  of natural  gas varies,  depending  on its place of origin.  Natural  gas is
widely  used as a fuel. It is advantageous  over liquid  and solid fuels and also other  gases,
except  H., due to its very high heat of combustion.
B. Petroleum
The word  petroleum  is derived  from  two Latin  words,  ‘petra’  meaning  rock, and ‘oleum’
meaning  oil. Thus, petroleum  means  rock oil. The term petroleum  refers  to a broad  range
of fossil  hydrocarbons  that are found  as gases,  liquids  or solids  beneath  the surface  of the
earth. The crude oil is generally  found along  with natural  gas in the form of a dark-
coloured  viscous  liquid,  which  is a complex  mixture  of hydrocarbons.  Its composition
varies according  to its place of origin. However,  crude oil mainly  contains  alkanes,
cycloalkanes  and aromatic  hydrocarbons.  It also contains  organic  compounds  consisting
of nitrogen,  sulphur  and oxygen  in small amounts.
Refining  of Crude Oil
Crude  oil or petroleum  is obtained  by drilling  wells until the oil-bearing  region  is reached.
After the crude oil is brought  to the surface  of the earth, it must be refined  before it
can be used.
Crude  oil is refined  or separated  into several  components  by fractional  distillation  based
on the differences  in boiling  ranges  of its fractions.  (Figure  1.11).

Most  hydrocarbons  present  in petroleum  are long-chain  hydrocarbons.  However,  there is
avery  high demand  for petrol  or gasoline,  which  contains  hydrocarbons,  composed  of five
to ten carbon  atoms.  Therefore,  the amount  of petrol  obtained  by fractional  distillation  of
crude  oil does not satisfy  the demand  for it. To satisfy  the demand  and maximize  the output
of petrol  or gasoline,  the process  called  cracking  is carried  out during  fractional  distillation.
What  does  cracking  mean?  Cracking  is the decomposition  of large  hydrocarbon  molecules
into smaller  ones by the application  of heat (thermal  cracking  or pyrolysis)  or in the
presence  of catalysts  (catalytic  cracking).

years. It is not a pure form of carbon.  It is an important  source  of aromatic  hydrocarbons.
Heating  mineral  coal in the absence  of air, or oxygen  is called  destructive  distillation  of coal
or coking  of coal. When  coal is heated  in the absence  of air it gives  volatile  products  and
coke. The volatile  products  separate  into coal gas and a liquid,  called  coal tar when  cooled.
Aromatic  hydrocarbons  and many  other  substances  are isolated  from coal tar by fractional
distillation.
Coke,  which  is a solid and relatively  pure form of carbon,  is used as a fuel in the blast
furnace  during  the extraction  of iron. It is also used to produce  gaseous  fuels, such as
water  gas (mixture  of H, and CO) and producer  gas (mixture  of N, and CO).

1. List some alcohols  you know? Name the alcohol used in alcoholic  beverages?  What
are the uses of alcohols  in industry?
2. Ethiopia  uses an alcohol blended  with benzene  to drive cars. What is the name of the
alcohol?  What is the source  of this alcohol?
What  do you think  when  you hear the word “alcohol”?  Can you define  alcohol?  Give a
few examples  of the uses of alcohols.  Most  people  think of two common  alcohols-  the
substance  that intoxicates  people  and the one used in clinics  and hospitals.  However,  there
are many  types of alcohol. The only alcohol  present  in all alcoholic  beverages  is called
ethanol. Other  alcohols  are used for different  purposes.
Alcohols  are hydroxyl  derivatives  of hydrocarbons  that can be obtained  by replacing  one
or more hydrogen  atom(s)  ofa hydrocarbon  with the hydroxyl  (—OH)  group. The hydroxyl
group is the functional  group  of alcohols.

1.6.1 Classification  of Alcohols
Alcohols  are generally  classified  as monohydric,  dihydric  and trihydric  depending  on the
number  of hydroxyl  (-OH)  groups  they contain  in their molecular  structure.
Monohydric  alcohols  are alcohols  containing  only one hydroxyl  group.
Examples
CH,—CH,—OH  CH,—CH,—CH,—OH
Ethanol 1-propanol
Dihydric  alcohols  are those containing  two hydroxyl  groups  per molecule.  They are also
named  glycols  or diols.
Example
one
HO OH
Ethane-1,2-diol  (Ethylene  glycol)
Trihydric  alcohols  are those containing  three hydroxyl  groups  in their molecular  structure.
Polyhydric  alcohols  are those containing  three or more hydroxyl  groups  in their molecular
structure.  Trihydric  alcohols  are also considered  as polyhydric  alcohols.

OH OH OH
Propane-1,2,3-triol  or Glycerine  or glycerol
1.6.2 Nomenclature  of Alcohols
An alcohol  can be considered  to be derived  from a hydrocarbon  by the replacement  of at
least one H atom by hydroxyl  group. Hence,  alcohols  can be systematically  named  by
using  the suffix  -o/ to replace  the terminal  -e in the corresponding  alkane  name.

In the IUPAC  system  of nomenclature  of alcohols  containing  side chains  or—OH  groups  in
different  positions,  the longest  chain  to which  the -OH group is attached,  is chosen  as a
parent  structure.  The chain  is then numbered,  starting  from the end closer  to the carbon
atom  to which  the—OH  group  is bonded.  The other  rules are similar  to the nomenclature  of
hydrocarbons.

Due to the hydrogen  bonding  in alcohols,  they have higher  melting  and boiling  points  than
hydrocarbons  of comparable  molecular  size (mass).  Hydrogen  bonding  is also the cause
for even lower  members  to be liquids  at room  temperature.  The boiling  point  of more

molecular  mass = 62), boils at 197°C, while 1-propanol  (monohydric,  molecular
mass = 60) boils at 97.2°C.
The first three alcohols,  methanol,  ethanol  and 1-propanol  are miscible  with water  in all
proportions,  while  the solubility  in water  decreases  with increasing  carbon  number.  The

Ethanol  (Ethyl  Alcohol),  CH,CH,OH
1 How do the local people  in Ethiopia  prepare  alcoholic  beverages  like “Tella;  “Tej” and
“Katikalla’?  What raw materials  and apparatus  do they use?
2 Which industrial  method  of production  of ethanol  is more or less similar  to the method
followed  by the local people? Share your ideas with your class.
Ethanol  is the second  member  of the homologous  series  of monohydric  alcohols.  It is one
of the constituents  of all alcoholic  beverages.  ‘Tella’,  ‘Tey’, beer, wine, “Katikalla’,  ouzo,
gin and whisky  contain  ethanol.  There are anumber  of methods  for preparing  ethanol
using  different  materials.
Industrial  preparation  of Ethanol
Ethanol  is manufactured  industrially  by:
1. Fermentation  of carbohydrates  such as sugar: Fermentation  is the slow
decomposition  of carbohydrates  such as sucrose,  starch  and cellulose  in the presence
of suitable  enzyme,  that results  in the formation  of ethanol  and carbon  dioxide:
invertaseC,.H,,0,, + H,O oe C5H,,0, + C.H,0¢
Sucrose Glucose Fructose
C,H,,.0O, ——— 2CH,CH,OH  + 2CO,
Glucose Ethanol
Fermentation  can produce  an alcoholic  beverage  whose ethanol content  is
12—15%  only. The alcohol  kills the yeast  and inhibits  its actrvity  when  the percentage
is higher.  To produce  beverages  of higher  ethanol  content,  distillation  of  the aqueous
solution  is required.
Most  liquor  factories  in Ethiopia  use molasses,  a by-product  of sugar  industries,  as
araw  material  to produce  ethanol.  In the brewing  industry,  germinated  barley  called
malt (in Amharic,  ‘Bikil’)is  used as the starting  material.  The whole  process  taking
place in breweries  is summarized  as follows:

2. Catalytic  Hydration  of Ethene:  Most ethanol  is manufactured  at present  by this
method.  In this process,  ethene  is treated  with steam at 573 K and 60 atm pressures
in the presence  of phosphoric  acid, H,PO,,  catalyst.

Properties  and Uses of Ethanol
Ethanol  is a colourless  liquid  with a pleasant  smell and a burning  taste. It boils at 78.3°C  and
freezes  at—117°C.  Itis inflammable  and burns  with a blue flame.  It is miscible  with  water  in all
proportions,  non-poisonous  and has an intoxicating  effect.  It is a hypnotic  (sleep  producer).
Ethanol  is a constituent  of all alcoholic  beverages.  It is a good solvent  for many  organic
compounds  that are insoluble  in water,  such as paints,  dyes, perfumes  etc. It is also used as
a fuel for cars and spirit lamps,  and to make denatured  alcohol  which  is a mixture  of
ethanol  and other  poisonous  substance  that has been added  to make  the alcohol  unfit for
drinking.  For example,  methylated  spirit  is a mixture  of 95% ethanol  and 5% methanol.
¢ Currently,  Ethiopia  uses 5% ethanol  with 95%  benzene  as fuel for cars.
Why alcoholic  beverages  such as “Tela; “Tej* beer and wine turn sour if they are not
properly  stored?  Which reaction  of alcohols  is responsible  for this phenomenon?  Write a
chemical  equation  to support  your answer. Discuss  with your group and present  it to the
Class.
What  types of reactions  do alcohols  undergo?  Alcohols  contain  a hydrocarbon  group  and
a functional  group  (OH).  Which  part of alcohols  is responsible  for most  of  their chemical
reactions?
Reactions  of alcohols  may involve  the cleavage  of  the oxygen  hydrogen  bond  (— O—  H) or
the carbon-oxygen  bond (— C — O).
The reactions  of alcohols  involving  the -O-H  bond cleavage  are:
a Alcohols  react with strongly  electropositive  metals  like Na, K and Ca to form
alkoxides  and liberating  H, gas.

Procedure:
Take two test tubes and add 2-5 mL of ethanol  to each of  the test tubes. Cut a very
small  piece of sodium  with a knife  and drop it into the first  test tube. Take magnesium

Write a general  reaction  for such reactions?
What  type of metals  react  in this manner?el au s+
Oxidation  of alcohols:  The oxidation  products  of alcohols  depend  on the type of
alcohol  and the nature  of  oxidizing  agents.  Oxidation  of alcohols  is a very important
method  for the production  of other  oxygen-containing  compounds  of hydrocarbons,
such as aldehydes,  ketones  and carboxylic  acids.
i) Oxidation  of primary  alcohols  in the presence  of mild oxidizing  agents  yields
aldehydes.

Note that aldehydes  are represented  by the general  structural  formula R — C — H or
RCHO,  where  R is an alkyl group.  In the case of methanal  R = H. For naming  aldehydes,
use the suffix -a/ to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding
alkane  name. The suffix  “‘-al” indicates  the functional  group  -CHO.  The names
and condensed  structures  of the first stx aldehydes  are given  in Table 1.11.

The general structural  formula  of ketones  is: R—C—  R’ or RCOR’ where R
and R’ may be same or different. The IUPAC names of ketones are obtained
by using the suffix -one to replace the terminal  -e in the corresponding  alkane
name. The suffix ‘-one’ indicates  the functional  group. Unlike aldehydes,  the
position  of the functional  group must be indicated  in the name of higher ketones.
To do so, the longest  chain containing  the functional  group is chosen as a parent
structure  and then the carbon atoms of the chain are numbered  starting  from the
end closer  to the carbonyl  group.

carboxylic  acids.

/ INTRODUCTION  TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1) >
Industrial  application
Organic  chemicals  are used for the manufacturing  of a large number  of industrial  products
that have a variety of uses. Some of these products  include alcoholic  beverages,
pharmaceuticals,  soaps and detergents  etc.
A. Alcoholic  beverages
All alcoholic  beverages  commonly  contain  the alcohol  known  as ethanol.  The ethanol
content  of all alcoholic  beverages  is not the same. Some beverages  contain  small
concentrations  of ethanol  while others  contain  higher  concentrations.  These alcoholic
beverages  can be either  undistilled  or distilled.  The undistilled  alcoholic  beverages  include
beer, wine, “Tella”,  ‘Tey’ etc while ouzo, gin, brandy,  whisky,  ‘Katikalla’,  and vodka  are
among  the distilled  alcoholic  beverages.
Beer: Beer is one of the alcoholic  beverages  widely  manufactured  and consumed  in
most  parts of the world.  The common  raw materials  for its production  are barley
and hops.  Although  the types of beer produced  in the world  are very many,  the
average  beer has alcohol  content  between  3-6 percent  by volume.
Wine: Wine is another  undistilled  alcoholic  beverage.  The most  common  raw material  for
producing  wine are grapes.  In the production  process,  grapes  are first crushed  and
then steamed.  The liquid  derived  from crushing  is called  must. It then goes to a
fermentation  tank  where  fermentation  takes place. Then  it passes  to a settling  tank,
where  sediments  are allowed  to settle, and it proceeds  from  there to a filter. The
clear liquid  is cooled  in arefrigerator  and is pasteurized  as it passes  through  a flash
pasteurizer.  Most  wines  have an alcohol  content  varying  from 10-15%  by volume.
Liquor: Compared  with beer and wine, liquor  contains  higher  concentrations  of ethanol.  It
is not possible  to obtain  an alcoholic  beverage  of  more  than 15% alcohol  by volume
through  fermentations.  This is because  the yeast  cells are not able to stay alive in
alcohol  of  higher  concentration.  To get alcoholic  beverages  with higher  percentages
of alcohol,  the alcohol  must  be separated  from  the solution  by distillation.
The alcoholic  beverages  like ouzo, gin, cognac,  whisky  etc, are made  by distillation.  Different
types of liquors  have different  alcohol  concentrations.  In most  distilled  alcoholic  beverages
the percentage  ranges  between  30-45%  alcohol  by volume.  However,  some alcoholic
beverages  like Araki  are expected  to have a higher  percentage  of ethanol.
B. Pharmaceuticals
Organic  chemicals  are used  to manufacture  drugs and medicines  for various  uses. These
drugs and medicines  are collectively  known as pharmaceuticals.  Some of the
pharmaceuticals  are:
79
— @—rwistevormve10
Analgesics: These are substances  that reduce pain. For example:  aspirin and
paracetamol.
Antiseptics: These  are substances  that help to prevent  infections  in wounds  by killing
bacteria;  for example,  acriflavine.
Sedatives: These are drugs  that make a person  go to sleep or make  them feel calm
and relaxed.  Examples  of such type of medicines  are the barbiturates,
which  include  several  important  drugs.
Disinfectants:  These  are substances  used to disinfect  something  or to kill bacteria;  for
example,  Dettol.
Sulphonamides:  These  are medicines  used as antibiotics.  For example:  penicillin.
C. Soaps  and Detergents
Organic  chemicals  are used for the synthesis  of soaps and detergents.  For example,  animal
fat and vegetable  oils are used for manufacturing  soap. Fats and oils are naturally  occurring
esters  of glycerol  and the higher  fatty acids. Long  open-chain  alcohols  and alkyl benzene
sulphonic  acid can be used for the production  of detergents.
Soaps  and detergents  are substances  used  to remove  dirt. They are also called  surfactants
or surface  active agents.  This is because  they reduce  the surface  tension  of water  and
change  the surface  properties.
Soaps  are either  sodium  or potassium  salts of higher  (long-chain)  carboxylic  acids. Soaps
that are sodium  salts are called  hard soaps and those that are potassium  salts are soft
soaps. Soaps  are prepared  by boiling  animal  fat or vegetable  oil with a base. The reaction
that produces  soap 1s called  saponification.

Detergents  contain  either  a sulfate  or a sulphonate  group.  One example  of detergents  is
sodium  lauryl sulfate,  C,, H,, —O—SO,—  ONa. It is prepared  first by reacting
dodecyl  (lauryl) alcohol with sulphuric  acid followed  by reaction  with

Preparation  of SoapExperiment  1.9
Objective:  To prepare  soap from animal  fat or vegetable  oil.
Materials  required:  Animal  fat or vegetable  oil, NaOH,  NaCl,  measuring  cylinder,
beaker,  glass rod, Bunsen  burner,  filter  paper,  funnel,  conical  flask, and
test tube.
Procedure:
Measure  3 mL vegetable  oil or 3 g animal  fat and place it ina 100 mL beaker;  add
3 mL of ethanol  and 3 mL of 5M NaOH.  Stir the mixture  vigorously  with a glass
rod and gently  heat over a flame  for 15 minutes  or until it turns in to a paste. When
the paste begins  to form, stir very carefully  to prevent  frothing.  After  all the paste
has formed,  set the beaker  on the bench  to cool. Add about 15 mL of saturated
NaCl solution  to the paste mixture  and stir thoroughly.  This process  is called  salting
out the soap. Filter  off  the soap mixture  by suction  filtration  and wash  the collected
soap precipitate  with 15 mL of ice water.
Observations  and analysis:
a Why do we add ethanol  during  the preparation?
b What  is the purpose  of adding  saturated  NaCl solution  to the paste mixture?
Write a laboratory  report  and present  to the class.

D. Dry Cleaning
The qualities  of some clothes  decrease  when  they are washed  with water  using ordinary
soap. In order  to avoid  this, other chemicals  are used for washing  purposes  that remove
dirt in the same manner  as soaps. Dry cleaning  refers  to the use of different  chemicals
that are capable  of dissolving  grease  and other dirt stains in a similar  manner  as soaps
without  the use of water.  The most  commonly  used chemicals  in dry cleaning  are organic
chemicals  such as tetrachloromethane,  CCL;  tetrachloroethylene,  Cl,C =CCL,;  benzene
and gasoline.
E. Fuels
The term fuel refers  to any material  that is capable  of burning  to produce  energy,  heat and
light. Most  fuels occurring  in nature  are organic  compounds.  However,  some inorganic
substances  like hydrogen,  producer  gas and water  gas are also used as gaseous  fuels. But,
the most  widely  used fuels at present  are of organic  origin.  This includes  petroleum  which
chiefly  contains  alkanes.  Natural  gas which  is used as a fuel for stoves  contains  mainly
methane.  Gasoline  which  is used as a fuel for internal  combustion  engines  also contains
alkanes.  Paraffin  wax which  is used to make candles  is another  fuel to get light energy  and
itis amixture  of alkanes  containing  more than twenty  carbon  atoms.  Besides  its use as a
constituent  of all alcoholic  beverages,  ethanol  can also be used as a fuel for internal
combustion  engines.  At present,  it is one of the substances  that we can rely on for use as a
fuel for automobiles.  The use of ethanol  as a fuel is now practiced  in our country  by mixing
it with petrol.  Ethanol  and other  plant seed oils can be classified  as bio fuels.
Agricultural  Applications
Organic  compounds  also play an important  role in agriculture,  specially  to increase  crop
productivity  by controlling  the damages  caused  by insects,  rodents,  fungi,  birds and weeds.
So, organic  chemicals  can be used in the manufacture  of pesticides  and herbicides.
What is the distinction  between  herbicides  and  pesticides?
Pesticides  are the chemicals  used for controlling  the damage  that can be caused  by fungi,
insects  and other  pests that attack  crops.  Among  the pesticides,  Bordeaux  mixture  is used
as fungicide.  Other  chemicals  like DDT,  aldrine,  dieldrine,  malathion  are used as insecticides.
Herbicides  are the chemicals  that are applied  on agricultural  lands to remove  unwanted
plants  or weeds.  Some  examples  of compounds  that are used as herbicides  include  paraquat,
diquat,  ammonium  sulphamate,  ammonium  glyphosinate,  sodium  chlorate  etc.
Fertilizers:  In order to increase  crop productivity  we use either synthetic  or natural
fertilizers.  Synthetic  fertilizers  are grouped  into three classes  as nitrogen,  potash  and
phosphate  fertilizers.  Nitrogen  is one of the essential  plant  nutrients.  It is absorbed  by
plants  in the form of nitrate  ion, NO, . Nitrogen  enables  green  plants  to synthesize  amino
acids and proteins,  and it is also a constituent  of DNA  molecules.  To provide  nitrogen  for
~ INTRODUCTION  TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1) >
plants,  nitrogen-containing  fertilizers  are usually  added  to the soil. These  include,  ammonium
salts like NH,CL,  (NH,),SO,,  nitrates  like KNO,  and urea. Urea  is one of  the most  important
nitrogen  fertilizers.  It is a component  of urine. On an industrial  scale, urea is manufactured
by the dehydration  of ammonium  carbamate:
H,N— COO NH, (s) ——> H,NCONH,  (s) + H,0O (g)
It can also be prepared  by direct  combination  of ammonia  and carbon  dioxide  at
180°C  and pressure  of about 140 atm.

Alcohols  are classified  depending  on the number  of hydroxyl  groups they
contain  as monohydric,  dihydric  and trihydric  alcohols.
Monohydric  alcohols  are classified  as primary  (1°), secondary  (2°) and
tertiary  alcohols  (3°).
The names of alcohols  contain  the suffix ‘-ol’ which indicates  the presence
of —OH group in the molecule.
Primary  alcohols  oxidize to give aldehydes  and then carboxylic  acids, and
secondary  alcohols  yield ketones  on oxidation.
Organic  chemicals  have industrial  applications  such as in the production
of alcoholic  beverages  and pharmaceuticals.
Organic  chemicals  are also used in the production  offertilizers,  pesticides
and weed killers  for agricultural  uses.
Organic chemicals  are also used as fuels, and to produce  soaps and

By completing  this section,  you will be able to:
¢ define inorganic  compounds;  and
¢ classify  inorganic  compounds  as oxides, acids, bases and salts.
Activity  2.1
In the laboratory,  take samples  of different  compounds  and classify  them as organic  and
inorganic.  When these compounds  are burnt in air, it has been found that most organic
compounds  burn when heated in air, but most inorganic  compounds  just melt or vaporize;
why? Discuss  your observations  in groups  and share your opinion  with the class.
Inorganic  compounds  are the compounds  consisting  of mineral  constituents  of the earth
or generally  found in non-living  things. The term inorganic  compound  refers to all
compounds  that do not contain  carbon.  Although,  carbon dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,
carbonates  and hydrogen  carbonates  are carbon-containing  compounds,  which are
classified  as inorganic  compounds.  Inorganic  compounds  are mostly  found in nature as
silicates,  oxides, carbonates,  sulphides,  sulphates,  chlorides  and nitrates,  etc.
There are different  ways for the classification  of inorganic  compounds.  They can be
classified  on the bases of their composition.  For example;  they can be classified  on
the basis of the:
i) metal they contain  such as copper  compounds,  aluminium  compounds,  etc.
IMPORTANTINOGANIC  COMPOUNDS  (UNIT2)
ii) non-metal  they contain  such as sulphur  compounds,  nitrogen  compounds,  etc.
iii) group they contain  such as sulphates,  nitrates,  carbonates,  etc.
This unit emphasizes  on the four groups of inorganic  chemicals  namely  oxides, acids,
bases and salts.

Competencies
After Completing  this section,  you will be able to:
¢ define oxides;
¢ classify  oxides as acidic, basic, amphoteric,  neutral and peroxides;
¢ define acidic oxides and give examples;
¢ explain  the chemical  properties  of acidic oxides;
¢ define basic oxides and give examples;
¢ explain  the chemical  properties  of basic oxides;

¢ define neutral oxides and give examples;
¢ define peroxides  and give examples;
¢ explain  the chemical  properties  of peroxides;  and
¢ conduct  an experiment  to distinguish  peroxides  from other oxides.
What are oxides?  Oxygen  reacts directly  with almost all elements  except  the noble
gases and inactive  metals like gold, platinum,  and palladium.  Such compounds  of oxygen
are called oxides. Oxides are binary compounds  containing  oxygen  and any other
element  (metal, non-metal  or metalloid).  Binary compounds  are those consisting  of
— @— cemistayeRADEIO
only two elements.  Examples  of oxides are calcium  oxide, CaO, aluminium  oxide,
AL,O,, sulphur  dioxide,  SO,, and carbon  monoxide,  CO.
The classification  of oxides into different  groups is based on their chemical  behaviour;
they are classified  as:
¢ Acidic  oxides
¢ Basic oxides
¢ Amphoteric  oxides
¢ Neutral  oxides, and
¢ Peroxides

Activity  2.2
1. The oxides,  CO., N,O,, P,O.,, SO, are acidic oxides.
a_ Are these oxides  formed by the combination  of oxygen  with
i) metals ii) non-metals or iii) = metalloids?
b What general  conclusion  can you draw about the composition  of acidic oxides?
2. The presence  of CO, is confirmed  by reacting  CO, with lime water.
a What is lime water? Is it a base or an acid?
b Write a balanced  chemical  equation  for the above reaction.
c What type of oxides react with bases?
Discuss  in your group and present  your findings  to the class.
Acidic  oxides are the oxides formed  by the chemical  combination  of oxygen  with non-
metals. Thus, acidic oxides are non-metal  oxides. These oxides are also called acid
anhydrides,  since they form acidic solutions  when reacted  or dissolved  in water. Acid
anhydride  means acid without  water.
>
Generally  speaking,  acidic oxides are non-metal  oxides. Examples  of acidic oxides
include carbon dioxide,  CO,, nitrogen  dioxide,  NO,, and sulphur dioxide, SO,.
However,  it is very important  to note that all non-metal  oxides are not necessarily
acidic oxides. For example,  carbon  monoxide,  CO, and di-nitrogen  monoxide,  N,O,
are non-metal  oxides,  but they are neutral  oxides which  will be discussed  later.
Chemical  Properties  of Acidic Oxides
Acidic  oxides undergo  the following  reactions:
1. Acidic  oxides (acid anhydrides)  dissolve  in water to form acidic solution  (acid).
Acid anhydride + water — Acid
Examples
CO, + H,O + _— H,CO, (Carbonic  acid)
N,O, + H,O — _— 2HNO,  (Nitrous  acid)
SO, + H,O + — H,SO, (Sulphurous  acid)
2. Acidic oxides react with basic or metallic  oxides to form salt.
Acidic oxide + Basic oxide —- _ Salt

CO, + NaO — Na,CO,
SO; + CaO — CaSO,
3. Acidic oxides react with bases to form salt and water. This reaction  is called
neutralization  reaction.

B. Basic Oxides
Oxides  that are composed  of metals and oxygen  are basic oxides. But, all metal oxides
are not necessarily  basic oxides;  for example  Al,O, and ZnO are amphoteric  oxides,
which will be discussed  in part (C).
Oxides  of metals that dissolve  in water and react with it to form basic or alkaline  solutions
are called basic anhydrides.  There are metallic  oxides which have basic properties  but
are insoluble  in water. These oxides react with acids to give salt and water.
Example
FeO + 2HCl > FeCl, + HO
The oxides of active metals,  group IA and heavier  members  of group ITA, dissolve  in
water and readily  form bases. The term base is used to describe  both soluble and
insoluble  basic oxides. Some examples  of basic oxides are Li,O, Na,O, K,O, MgO,
CaO, BaO, and CuO.
Chemical  Properties  of Basic Oxides
What common  reaction  do basic oxides undergo?  What  products  do they form
in their reactions  with water, acidic oxides and acids?
1. Basic oxides dissolve  in water to form alkaline  solutions.  As they dissolve,  they
react with water to form the corresponding  metal hydroxides.

Procedure:
1. Ignite a small amount  of powdered  sulphur  on a deflagrating  spoon and insert
in a gas jar of oxygen.  Add 10 mL water after ignition  is complete.  Cover  the
gas jar with a lid and shake. Take two test tubes and pour 5 mL of the
solution  to each test tube. Add a few drops of universal  indicator  solution  to
the first test tube and blue litmus paper in the second.
2. Ignite a small amount  of magnesium  or calcium  metal on a deflagrating  spoon and
insert in to a gas jar of oxygen.  Add 10 mL water to the ash formed  and shake. Take
two test tubes and pour 5 mL of the solution  to each of the test tubes. Add a few
drops of universal  indicator  in the first and red litmus paper to the second  test tube.
Observations  and analysis:
a What compounds  are formed  by the combustion  of sulphur  and magnesium  or
calcium?  Write chemical  equations  to show the reactions.
b What happens  when water is added to the gas jars in which sulphur  was burnt?
c What colours  are observed  by adding drops of universal  indicator  and blue or
red litmus to the solutions  in the test tubes?
d Why does the change in the colour of indicators  occur in the various  solutions?
Write a laboratory  report and submit  to your teacher.
Universal  indicator  and litmus paper serve as indicators.  Indicators  are substances
used to identify  whether  a given solution  is acidic or basic by showing  colour changes.
Table 2.1 shows some common  indicators  and the colour  they develop  in acidic and
basic solutions.
Table 2.1 Some common  indicators  and their colours  in acidic  and basic solution.
Universal Indicator Yellow  - Orange  (in weakly acidic) Blue (in weakly  basic)  and
and red (in strongly  acidic) purple  (in strongly  basic)
Litmus Red Blue
Phenolphthalein Colourless Pink (red)
Methyl  orange Red Yellow
In addition  to their effects on indicators,  acidic and basic oxides can be identified  by their
chemical  properties.  Acidic oxides react with bases while basic oxides react with acids.
But acidic oxides do not react with acids and basic oxides do not react with bases.

C. Amphoteric  Oxides
Activity  2.3
1. How would you classify  the oxides of period III elements?
2. What trend do you observe  in the properties  of oxides of the elements  in a period as
you go from left to right in the periodic  table?
Discuss  this in your group and present  to the class.
There are oxides which exhibit  both acidic and basic properties.  These are known as
amphoteric  oxides. In their reaction  with acids, they behave as bases and, in their
reaction  with bases they act as acids. The following  reaction  shows the amphoteric
behaviour  of aluminium  oxide, Al,O,.
Amphoteric  oxide + Acid > salt + water
ALO, (s) + 6HCI (aq) > 2AICl,  (aq) + 3H,0 (1)
Amphoteric  oxide + base > salt + water
ALO, (s) + 2NaQOH  (aq) —> 2NaAlO,  (aq) + H,0 (1)
sodium  aluminate
Some other examples  of amphoteric  oxides are ZnO, PbO, PbO,, SnO, and SnO.,. It
is also important  to realize that hydroxides  which react with both acids and bases are
described  as amphoteric  substances.  For example,  aluminium  hydroxide,  Al(OH),,  reacts
with both acids and bases to form salt and water. So, Al(OH),,  is amphoteric  in nature.
What is the common  characteristic  of acidic, basic and amphoteric  oxides?  Acidic
oxides form salts when reacted  with basic oxides and bases. Basic oxides also produce
salts in their reactions  with acidic oxides and acids. Amphoteric  oxides form salts
when they react with acids and bases. Thus, acidic oxides, basic oxides and amphoteric
oxides are salt-forming  oxides.

Materials  required:
Spatula,  reagent  bottles, beakers,  glass rod, ALO,, HCl, NaOH, Universal
indicator  and water.
Procedure:
1. Prepare  solutions  by:
a mixing  20 mL concentrated  HCl and 80 mL water in one reagent  bottle;
b_ dissolving  8 g NaOH in 100 mL water in another  reagent  bottle.
c Add universal  indicator  to the acid and base, and observe  the colour  change.
Take two beakers  and place a spatula  full of Al,O, in each of the beakers.
Pour the HCI solution  (which  you prepared)  into one of the beakers  and NaOH
solution  into the other. Stir the mixture  with a glass rod.

D. Neutral  Oxides
Neutral  oxides react neither  with acids nor with bases to form salt and water. Hence,
neutral  oxides do not show basic and acidic properties.  Examples  of neutral  oxides
are water, H,O, carbon monoxide,  CO, dinitrogen  monoxide,  N,O, and nitrogen
monoxide,  NO. Neutral  oxides are very few in number.

used to decolorize  hair? Compare  the oxidation  number  of oxygen  in Na,O and MgO
with the oxidation  number  of the compound  used for decolorizing  hair.
Discuss  your findings  in group and present  to the class.
E. Peroxides
In acidic, basic, amphoteric  and neutral oxides,  the oxidation  state of oxygen  is —2,
but in peroxides  it is —1. In peroxides,  the two oxygen  atoms are linked to each other
and with atoms of other elements.  They contain  the peroxide,  “— O — O —” link. In
the oxides discussed  above, oxygen  atoms are linked directly  with atoms of other elements.
Some examples  of peroxides  are hydrogen  peroxide,  H,O,, sodium  peroxide,  Na,O,,
calcium  peroxide,  CaO,, barium  peroxide,  BaO,, and strontium  peroxide,  SrO,,.
Most peroxides  of metals are formed  by burning  the metals in a sufficient  amount  of oxygen.
2Na(s) + O, (g) > Na,O, (s)
Ca (s) + O, (g) = CaO, (Ss)
Chemical  Properties  of Peroxides
What chemical  properties  do the peroxides  exhibit?  Some of the chemical  properties
of peroxides  include:
a Peroxides  are powerful  oxidizing  agents; they react with different  substances
by losing oxygen.
Examples
PbS (s) + 4H,O, (aq) — PbSO,(s) + 4H,O ()
2KI (aq) + H,SO,  (aq) + H,O, (aq) > I, (s) + K,SO,(aq)  + 2H,O (1)
b _Peroxides  react with aqueous  acids to form hydrogen  peroxide.
Examples
Na,O, (s) + 2HCI (aq) — 2NaCl (aq) + H,O, (aq)
CaO, (s) + H,SO, (aq) — CaSO, (s) + H,O, (aq)
Hydrogen  Peroxide
The structure  of the hydrogen  peroxide  molecule  is:
— @&— Gemstevcrvero
Hydrogen  peroxide  decomposes  to release oxygen.  This reaction  is slow but can be
speeded  up by the addition  of manganese  (IV) oxide, MnO,,, as a catalyst.
2H,O,(aq) — 2H,O (I) + O,(g)
Hydrogen  peroxide  is a strong oxidizing  agent. Its oxidizing  power is responsible  for
its effectiveness  as an antiseptic  for mouthwash  and cleansing  wounds.  It is also used
as a bleaching  agent. When hydrogen  peroxide  is added to a coloured  dye, the molecule
responsible  for the colour  will oxidize  and so the colour  will disappear.  For example,
if hydrogen  peroxide  is added to a black dye (paint)  that contains  lead sulphide,  PbS,
the black colour turns white. This is due to the oxidation  of PbS to PbSO,. The
equation  for this process  1s:
PbS (s) + 4H,O, — PbSO, + 4H,0 (1)
Experiment  2.3. TM

life?

In which form does the hydrogen  ion, H*, exist in aqueous  solutions?
Discuss  with your group and present  it to the class.
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS  (UNT2)
Acids are among  the most familiar  of all chemical  compounds.  Acetic acid in vinegar,
citric acid in lemons and other citrus fruits, are among  the acids that we encounter
every day. Hydrochloric  acid is the acid in gastric  juice; it is essential  to digestion.
Phosphoric  acid gives flavour  to many carbonated  beverages.
Definitions  of Acids
a Arrhenius  Definition  of  Acids
The simplest  definition  of acids is suggested  by Savante  Arrhenius,  a Swedish  Chemist.
Arrhenius  defined  an acid as a substance  that releases  hydrogen  ion or proton, H*, or
hydronium  ion, H,O", in aqueous  solution.
Example
HClaq) — Haq) + Cag)
or,
HClag) + H,O0) —> H,O*%(aq) + ~ CF(aq)
Some examples  of Arrhenius  acids are HCl, HNO,, H,SO,,  HI, HBr, and HF. For a
substance  to be called an Arrhenius  acid, it should contain  ionizable  hydrogen.
Despite  its early success  and usefulness,  the definition  of an acid, first proposed  by
Arrhenius  has some limitations.  The Arrhenius  definition  of acids explains  their behaviour
only in aqueous  solution.  In addition,  it does not explain  why some substances  show
acidic behaviour  in the gaseous  state and in non-aqueous  solutions.
For example,  when ammonia  and hydrogen  chloride  gases are brought  together,  they
react to form ammonium  chloride  as follows:
NH,(g) + HCl(g) > NH,CI(s)
In this reaction,  the hydrogen  chloride  provides  hydrogen  ion (or proton),  H*, which
reacts with NH, to form NH,". But, this happens  in the gaseous  state not in aqueous
solution.  Due to the limitations  of Arrhenius’  definition,  chemists  tried to define acids in
a more general  way.
Bronsted-Lowry  Definition  of Acids
A broader  and more general  definition  of acids was provided  independently  in 1923,
by Johannes  Bronsted  and Thomas  M. Lowry.  According  to Bronsted-Lowry  definition;
an acid is a substance  that donates  protons,  H*, to some other substance.
mx¢  © CHEMISTRYGRADE10,
Examples
HCI (aq) + H,O (1) —> H,O* (aq) + CT (aq)
NH, (aq) + H,O () = NH, (aq) + OH (aq)
HPO, (aq) + 2H,O(I) = HPOF (aq) + 2H,O0* (aq)
In the above reactions,  HCI in the first, H,O in the second  and H,PO, in the third
are Bronsted-Lowry  acids because  they are proton donors. Here it is very important
to realize that all Arrhenius  acids are Bronsted-Lowry  acids. However,  the reverse
is not true because  Bronsted-Lowry  acids include substances  that are not acids
according  to Arrhenius.
Although  the Bronsted-Lowry  definition  of an acid is more general  than the definition
proposed  by Arrhenius,  it still depends  on the transfer  of protons.  However,  the
presence  of acids that are not proton-donors,  initiated  chemists  to search for another
definition  of acids.
b Lewis  Definition  of  Acids
In 1923, the American  chemist  Gilbert  Newton  Lewis produced  a definition  of acid
that extends  the concept  of acids even further  than that of Bronsted-Lowry.
According  to Lewis, an acid is a substance  that can form a coordinate  covalent
bond by accepting  an electron  pair from another  substance.  In other words, an
acid is an electron-pair  acceptor.  Consider  the following  reactions:
F F
F—B+QFi ——> |F—B<—F
F F
Lewis acid
In the above reaction,  between  BF, and F-, BF, acts as a Lewis acid since it accepts
a pair of electrons  from F-.
The Lewis definition  of an acid is also valid for the Arrhenius  concept  of an acid.
This is because  as the acid releases  an hydrogen  ion, H*, in aqueous  solution,  the
released  proton or H* accepts a pair of electrons  from a water molecule  to form an
hydronium,  H,O° ion.
a o |aN x |H H H 7H
Lewis acid Hydronium  ion
The Lewis definition  of an acid is also valid for the Bronsted-Lowry  concept  of
acids. Since Bronsted-Lowry  defined  an acid as a proton donor, the donated  proton
can be accepted  by a molecule  or species  that has lone pair of electrons.  So the
proton, HTM, is an electron  pair acceptor  and hence a Lewis acid. Consider  the
following  reaction.
NH; (g) + H,O() = NHj (aq) + _ OH (aq)
In this reaction,  H,O is a proton donor and hence a Bronsted-Lowry  acid. The donated
proton from water to ammonia,  accepts a pair of electrons  from the nitrogen  atom in
NH, to form NH," as shown below:
| |nnd e —» |H-—N—>H
H _
Lewis acid
The Lewis concept  of acids not only includes H” as an acid, but also ions or molecules
capable  of accepting  an electron  pair that neither  release H* in aqueous  solution  nor
donate a proton.
Classification  of Acids
Activity  2.6
Phosphoric  acid, H,PO,, has three hydrogen  atoms and it is a triprotic  acid. Acetic acid,
CH,COOH,  has four hydrogen  atoms and is classified  as a monoprotic  acid. Discuss  the
reason in your group and present  it to the class.
There are different  ways of classifying  acids; they can be classified  depending  on the
number  of replaceable  (ionizable)  hydrogen  atom(s)  they contain  per molecule  as
monoprotic  or polyprotic  acids.
Monoprotic  acids are the acids containing  only one ionizable (replaceable)
hydrogen  atom per molecule  or those acids that can furnish only one hydrogen
107
@—  aemstevcraver0
ion per molecule  in aqueous  solution.  Common  examples  of monoprotic  acids are
HCl, HNO,,  HBr, HI, and CH,COOH.  The ionization  of a monoprotic  acid in aqueous
solution  is presented  using HCl and HNO, as specific  examples,  as shown  below:
HCl (aq) 7- H* (aq) + Cl (aq)
HNO, (aq) > HH’ (aq) + — NO; (aq)
Polyprotic  acids are those acids containing  more than one ionizable  (replaceable)
hydrogen  ion in aqueous  solution.  Example  of acids in this category  includes  H,SO,,
H,CO,, and H,PO,.
The ionization  of polyprotic  acids in aqueous  solution  is shown in the following  chemical
equations:
H,SO, (aq) > 2H* (aq) + SO (aq)
H,CO, (aq) = 2H’ (aq) + CO} (aq)
HPO, (aq) = 3H*(aq) + PO} (aq)
Polyprotic  acids which contain  two ionizable  hydrogen  atoms such as H,SO,,  H,S,
and H,CO, are also called diprotic  acids; those containing  three ionizable  hydrogen
atoms like H,PO, are called triprotic  acids.
Activity  2.7
Ammonia  and phosphoric  acid have three hydrogen  atoms but ammonia  does not behave
as triprotic  acid. Why? Discuss  in your group and present  it to the class.
Acids can also be classified  depending  on the number  of their constituent  elements  as
binary and ternary  acids. Binary acids are those acids composed  of only two elements.
Examples  of binary acids are HCl, HBr, HF, HI, and HS.
Ternary  acids also called oxy-acids  are acids composed  of three different  elements.
They usually  contain  hydrogen,  oxygen  and a non-metal.  Examples  are H,SO,,  H,CO,,
HCIO,, and H,PO,.
General  Properties  of Acids
Activity  2.8
Add a drop of lemon juice on your tongue and try to identify  its taste. Repeat your
observation  with orange  juice. Do the two juices taste bitter or sour? Try to classify  them
as acid or base, depending  on their taste. Share your observations  with the rest of class.
Acids generally  have the following  properties:
1. Acids have a sour taste
Aqueous  solutions  of acids have a sour taste. Lemon  juice and orange  Juice taste
sour due to the presence  of citric acid. Citric acid is harmless.  However,  most
concentrated  acids are corrosive  and poisonous.  So it is strictly  forbidden  to attempt
to identify  such acids by tasting  them.
2. Acids change  the colour  of indicators
The common  indicators  available  in high school laboratories  are litmus,
phenolphthalein,  methyl  orange  or methyl  red and universal  indicator.  The effect of
acids on the colour of indicators  is summarized  in Table2.1,  Section  2.2.

3. Acids react with active metals  to form salt and hydrogen  gas
Metals like magnesium,  zinc, and iron react with dilute acids to form salt and liberate
hydrogen  gas.
Acid + Active metal — Salt + Hydrogen  gas
Examples
2HCl «6+ = Mm 68>) 6M, Ct CU
H,SO, + Mg —> MgSO, + 4H,
Very active metals like sodium,  potassium,  and calcium  react very violently  with dilute
acids. The reaction  is very dangerous  and should  not be performed.
Acids reacting  with metals do not necessarily  produce  hydrogen  gas. For example,
concentrated  nitric acid and hot concentrated  sulphuric  acid react with copper  producing
nitrogen  dioxide  and sulphur  dioxide  gases, respectively,  instead  of hydrogen.  This is
because  concentrated  HNO, and hot concentrated  H,SO, are oxidizing  acids. The
reactions  of these acids with copper  are given by the following  equations:
Cu + 4HNO, -> ~ Cu(NO,), + 2NO, + 2H,0
Cu + 2H,SO, —> CuSO, + SO, + 2H,O
Experiment  2.5
Investigating  the Reactions  of Metals with Dilute Acids
Objective:  To investigate  the reaction  between  active metals and dilute acids.
Materials  required:  Dilute H,SO,, dilute HCI, zinc, magnesium  and iron, test
tubes, test tube holder,  test tube rack, burner,  wooden  splint, spatula.
Procedure:
Take three test tubes and place a spatula-full  of powdered  zinc in the first,
powdered  magnesium  in the second  and iron filings in the third. Pour dilute
HCl into each of the test tubes until the metals are completely  covered  by the
acid. To test the type of gas evolved,  cover one of the test tubes with a piece
of cardboard  for a few seconds.  Bring a burning  splint close to the mouth of
the test tube and remove  the cardboard.
Repeat  the experiment  with dilute H,SO, after placing  each of the three metals
in three different  test tubes.
Observations  and analysis:
a What does the formation  of bubbles  indicate?
b What sound do you hear when the burning  splint is close to the mouth of
the test tube?
c Which  gas is evolved  during the reaction?
d Which  metal’s  reaction  with dilute HCI or H,SO, is the most violent?
Write a laboratory  report on your observations  and present  to the class.
4. Acids react with carbonates  and hydrogen  carbonates  to form salt, water
and carbon  dioxide  gas
Acid + hydrogen  carbonate — salt + water + carbon dioxide
Acid + — carbonate — salt + water + carbon dioxide
Examples

Strength  of Acids (Strong and Weak Acids)
Activity  2.9
1. Add a few drops of citric acid solution  and nitric acid separately  on a piece of waste
cotton cloth; what happens?  Based on your observations,  can you classify  these acids as
weak acid or strong acid?
2. You are allowed  to taste some acids like acetic acid (in the form of vinegar),  and citric
acid at home, but you are never allowed  to taste any kind of acids in the laboratory.
What is the reason?
Discuss  your findings in your group and present  to the class.
Acids can be classified  as strong acids and weak acids depending  on their degree of
ionization  in aqueous  solution,  i.e., the extent to which the acids dissociate  to form
hydrogen  or hydronium  ions when they dissolve  in water. A strong acid is one that
ionizes almost completely  in aqueous  solution.  Examples  of strong acids are HCIO,,
HI, HBr, HCl, HNO,, and H,SO,. These acids dissociate  to a very high extent as
shown  below:
HCI (aq) > H* (aq) + Cl (aq)
HNO, (aq) > HTM (aq) + NO; (aq)
HClO,  (aq) — H*(aq) + ClO; (aq)
A dilute aqueous  solution  of strong acids contains  predominantly  the ions derived  from
the acids instead of the acid molecules.  For example,  HCI and HNO, are almost
completely  ionized  in water.
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS  (UNIT 2)
An acid that releases  few hydrogen  ions in aqueous  solution  is a weak acid. The
aqueous  solution  of a weak acid contains  hydronium  ions, anions and dissolved
molecules  of the acid.
Organic  acids which contain  the acidic carboxyl  group -COOH,  are generally  weak
acids. For example,  CH,COOH,  ionizes slightly  in water to give hydronium  ions and
acetate ions, CH,COOTM.
CH,COOH  (aq) + H,O(l) = CH,COOTM  (aq) + H,0*(aq)
Concentrated  and Diluted  Acids
Activity  2.10
1. In a solution,  if there is 95% H,O and the rest is HCI, what kind of solution  is it?
2. Ina car battery,  the electrolyte  used is 35% of H,SO,.  How many percent  of it is water?
What do you think about  the concentration  of the electrolyte?
“Concentrated”  and “dilute”  are terms used to describe  the relative  amount  of acid in
a given acid solution.
A concentrated  acid contains  a relatively  large amount  (percentage)  of acid and a
small amount  of water. For example,  concentrated  sulphuric  acid is 98% H,SO, and
2% water. Concentrated  acetic acid is 99% acetic acid and 1% water. But, H,SO, is
a strong acid and CH,COOH  a weak acid.
A dilute acid contains  a relatively  small amount  of acid dissolved  in large amount  of
water. For example,  a diluted  solution  of sulphuric  acid may contain 10% H,SO, and
90% H,O.
The concentration  of an acid is the measure  of the number  of moles of the acid in one
litre of acid solution  and is expressed  in mol/L. This unit of concentration  is called
Molarity,  denoted  by M. Mathematically,
Number  of moles  of the substance  dissolved
Molarity  (M) =Volume  of solution  in litres
Mass of the substance  dissolved  in grams
| =Number  of moles of the substance Molar  mass of the substance
For example,  the concentration  of 98% H,SO, is about 18 mol/L. If one litre of this
acid is added to 2 litres of water to make 3 litres of solution,  the concentration  will
@ ceistevcraven0
become  6 mol/L. The new solution  obtained  is a dilute solution  of H,SO,. Thus,
concentrated  acids contains  a greater  number  of moles of acid while dilute acids contain
less number  of moles of the acid per litre of the acid solution.
Example
How many moles of HCl are present  in 0.8 L of a 0.5 7 HCI solution?
Solution:
= 7 = MV= 05 1 x 08 L = 04 mol HCl, where Mf is the
molarity,  7, the number  of moles and V, volume  of solution  in litre.
An important  aspect of the property  of acids is that they conduct  electricity  in aqueous
solutions,  i.e., the acids are electrolytes.  The extent of conduction  of electricity  depends
on the amount  of ions present  in the solution.  Thus, aqueous  solutions  of strong acids
are better conductors  of electricity  than the same concentrations  of weak acid solutions.
The conduction  of electricity  through  acid solution  is also used as one means of
identification  between  weak and strong acids.

Precautions  when Handling  Acids
Concentrated  acids are extremely  corrosive  and poisonous.  They can destroy  metals
and clothes;  produce  a chemical  burn on skin or inside the body. If taken internally
they can be fatal. So acids must be handled  with care.
The following  precautions  are helpful while working  with acids:
a Wear goggles,  gloves and a laboratory  coat.
b Ifaconcentrated  acid is spilled or splashed  on your body, first wash the affected
part with running  water and then with 10% Na,CO,  solution.
c If concentrated  acid is spilled on to cloth, immediately  wash it with running  water.
d Ifan acid enters your eye, wash with water repeatedly  and then consult  a doctor.

e If corrosive  acids are swallowed,  administer  weak bases such as Mg(OH),  or
Al(OH).
f Use bellows  to pipette acid instead  of sucking  using yours lips.
g To dilute concentrated  acids, pour the concentrated  acid in to water and not
water in to the acid.
DH and pH scale
Expressing  acidity as the concentration  of H,O* can be cumbersome  because  the
values tend to be very small. A more convenient  quantity  called pH is used to indicate
the concentration  of H,O°. The letter pH stands for the French words pouvoir
hydrogéne,  meaning  “hydrogen  power”.
pH is defined  as the negative  logarithm  of the Aydrogen  ion concentration  (hydronium
ion concentration).  The mathematical  expression  is:
pH = log = — log [H"]l
[H"]
The square bracket  [ ] means concentration  in mol/L.
To calculate  the hydrogen  ion concentration  of a solution  from its pH we can proceed
as follows.
[H*] = antilog (-pH) = 10-P#
The pH of a solution  can be measured  using universal  indicator  solution,  pH indicator
paper or a pH-meter.  When universal  indicator  solution  or pH indicator  papers are
added to an acid solution,  they develop  different  colours depending  on the pH of the
solution.  So, to identify  the pH, we need to compare  the colour developed  with the
standard  colour chart. A pH meter is an electronic  device,  which reads the pH of a
solution  directly.  (Figure  2.3).

Figure  2.3. a) The colour  of universal  indicator  in solutions  of pH from 1 to 12,
b) ApH  meter  with its electrical  probe  dipped  into an orange.
Acidity  and alkalinity  are usually  expressed  on the pH scale. The range is between  0
and 14.
. Acidity  increases Basicity  increases
Strong  acid Weak  acid Weak base Strong  base
Neutral
A neutral solution  has a pH value of 7 at 298 K. Acidic  solutions  have pH values less
than 7. As the pH value decreases  the acidity of the solution  increases.  For example,
if two solutions  A and B have pH values of 4 and 6, respectively,  then we can conclude
that solution  A is more acidic than solution  B. The hydrogen  ion concentration  in
solution  A is one hundred  times greater  than that in B.
The following  examples  will guide us through  how to calculate  pH values of solutions.
Example
Calculate  the pH of a 0.001 M solution  of HC1?
Solution:
HCI is a strong acid and dissociates  almost  completely.
The dissociation  of 0.001 M (0.001 mol/L) of HCI produces  0.001 mol/L of
H* and 0.001 mol/L of Cl as follows:
HCl (aq) — Haq) + _ CE (aq)
0.001 mol/L 0.001mol/L 0.001 mol/L
Thus, [H*] = 0.001 mol/L = 1 x 107M
pH =-—log [H*] =-— log 1 x 107 =3
Example
The hydrogen  ion concentration  in a dilute solution  of vinegar  is 4.6 x 10° M.
What is the pH of the solution?
Solution:
pH = — log [H*] = — log (4.6 x 10>) =— (log 4.6 + log 10-°)
=~ (log 4.6 — 5) = — (0.663 — 5) = 4.337
Example
The pH of lemon  juice was determined  to be 3. What is the hydrogen  ion
concentration  in the lemon  juice?
Solution:
pH = — log [H"]; —pH = log [H"]
[H*] = antilog (-pH) = 10°" = 103M
Exercise  2.7
1. The pH of a given solution  is 8. What is the hydrogen  ion concentration  of the
solution?
2. Two solutions  A and B have pH values of 2 and 6 respectively.  How many
times greater  is the hydrogen  ion concentration  in solution  A than that of
solution  B?

Preparation  of Acids
Acids can be prepared  by:
1. The reaction  of oxides of non-metals  (acidic  oxides)  and water:
Acidic oxide + Water — Acid
Examples
SO,(g) + HOW -- - HO, (aq)
N,O;(s) + H,O(@) — _ 2HNO,  (aq)
P,O,, (s) + 6H,O() > 4H,PO,  (aq)
2. Direct combination  of some non-metals  like S, Cl, Br with hydrogen:
This method  is mostly  used to prepare  binary acids (acids consisting  only two
elements)
Examples
H,(g) + CL(g) 72 2HCI(g)
H,(g) + #£4Br(g) > — 2HBr(g)
When gaseous  hydrogen  chloride  and hydrogen  bromide  dissolve  in water,
they form hydrochloric  acid and hydrobromic  acid respectively.
3. Using a non-volatile  acid: Volatile  acids can be prepared  by heating  their
salts with a non-volatile  acid such as concentrated  sulphuric  acid, H,SO,.

IMPORTANT  INOGANIC  COMPOUNDS  (UNIT 2) -
Hydrochloric  Acid, HCl is present  naturally  in the gastric  juice of our body and
helps in the digestion  of food. Industrially,  hydrochloric  acid is important  for pickling
of iron and steel (to remove  surface  impurities)  before galvanizing  and tin plating.  It
is also used to produce  aniline dyes, drugs, photographic  films, plastics  like polyvinyl
chloride  (PVC), and to recover  magnesium  from sea water.
Nitric Acid, HNO, is used industrially  in the manufacture  of explosives  such as
trinitrotoluene  (TNT) and trinitroglycerine,  fertilizers  such as KNO, and NH,NO,,
rubber, chemicals,  plastics,  dyes and drugs.
Sulphuric  acid, H,SO,  is the leading  industrial  chemical.  It is widely  used in the
production  of sulphate  and phosphate  fertilizers,  synthetic  fibres, paints, drugs,
detergents,  paper and dyes. It is also used in petroleum  refining,  production  of metals
and as electrolyte  in car batteries.

Bases belong to the class of inorganic  compounds  that include  most oxides and
hydroxides  of metals. They are of great importance  in chemical  industries  and in our
daily lives, directly  or indirectly.  For example,  sodium  hydroxide,  NaOH  is used in the
production  of soap, paper, textile etc. Potassium  hydroxide,  KOH is used to produce
soft soap, fertilizers  etc. Calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH),,  is used to manufacture  mortar
and bleaching  powder,  to remove  soil acidity etc.
Definition  of Bases
There are different  definitions  of bases, as suggested  by different  chemists  namely  Arrhenius,
Bronsted-Lowry  and Lewis.
— @&— Gemstevcrvero
Arrhenius  definition  of bases: A base is any substance  that ionizes (dissociates)  in
aqueous  solution  to release  hydroxide,  OH” ions. Arrhenius  bases are mostly ionic
metal hydroxides  such as, LiOH,  NaOH,  KOH and Ba(OH),.  The dissociation  of a
few bases is shown by the following  equations:
NaOH (aq) > Na’ (aq) + OH (aq)
Ba(OH),  (aq) —> Ba** (aq) + 20H (aq)
Bronsted-Lowry  definition  of bases: A base is a substance  that is capable of
accepting  proton(s),  H’. Thus, a base is a proton, H* acceptor.
Note:
Note that not all Bronsted-Lowry  bases are Arrhenius  bases, but all Arrhenius
bases contain  the hydroxide  ion which is a Bronsted-Lowry  base. This is because
OH: can accept a proton, H*, to form water.
According  to the Bronsted-Lowry  definition,  an acid-base  reaction  is the transfer  of a
proton from an acid to a base.
Example
NH, (aq) + HCl(aq) — NH, (aq) + CT (aq)
Base Acid
HCO, (aq) + OH (aq) = COZ (aq) + HOC)
Acid Base
Lewis Definition  of Bases
The Lewis definition  is a more general  definition  than the Arrhenius  and Bronsted-
Lowry definitions.  According  to Lewis, a base is a substance  that is capable  of
donating  a pair of electrons.  In other words, a base is an electron-pair  donor.
Brensted-Lowry  bases are also bases according  to the Lewis concept.  This is
because  for Bronsted-Lowry  bases to accept a proton, H* they should have a
lone pair. However,  Lewis base include  other species  that can form a coordinate
covalent  bond by sharing  their lone pair with substances  other than a proton,  H”.
It is important  to note that Lewis acid-base  reactions  include  many reactions  that
do not involve protons.  The following  equation  shows an acid-base  reaction
according  to Lewis concept:

General  Properties  of Bases
Activity  2.14
Dissolve  one table-spoon  of washing  soda in a glass of water.  Try to wash your hands with
this solution.  How do you feel? Does it give a soapy touch or an oily touch. Share your
observations  with the rest of the class.
Bases like NaOH,  KOH, and Ba(OH),  are readily soluble in water, while others such as
Mg(OH),  are slightly  soluble.  Bases that are soluble  in water are also called alkalis.
Bases or alkalis show the following  properties:
1. Bases  are slippery  to the touch  and have  a bitter  taste: Bases  have  a bitter
taste; feel slippery  to the skin in dilute aqueous  solutions.  Strong  bases such as
NaOH  and KOH are very corrosive  and poisonous.  So they should  be neither
brought  in to contact  with the skin nor tasted.
2. Soluble  bases change  the colour  of indicators:  Aqueous  solutions  of bases
turn the colour  of red litmus  to blue, phenolphthalein  to pink (red), methyl  red to
yellow  and universal  indicator  blue (purple).
3. Soluble  bases release  hydroxide  ion in aqueous  solution:  The characteristic
properties  of bases in aqueous  solutions  are due to the presence  of the hydroxide
ion, OH” which  they release  on dissolution.
Examples
KOH (aq) > K* (aq) + OH (aq)
Ca(OH),  (aq) == Ca’* (aq) + 2OH- (aq)
4. Bases  neutralize  acids or acidic  oxides  to form salt and water:
Base + Acid (or acidic oxide) — Salt + Water
Examples
2NaOH  (aq) + H,SO, (aq) — NaSO,  (aq) + 2H,O (1)
2KOH (aq) + SO; (g) —> K,SO, (aq) + H,O()
Ca(OH),  (aq) + 2HCl(aq) — CaCl, (aq) + 2H,O (1)
5. Aqueous  solutions  of bases conduct  electricity:  Soluble  bases are electrolytes.
Solutions  of strong  bases are good conductors  while solutions  of weak  bases are
poor conductors.
Strength  of Bases (Strong and Weak Bases)
Activity  2.15
Is a concentrated  base a strong base and a dilute base a weak base? Discuss in your
group and present  to the class.
Both acids and bases are classified  as strong and weak depending  on their degree of
ionization  (dissociation)  in aqueous  solution.
Strong bases are those which ionize (dissociate)  completely  or almost completely  in
water solutions.  Examples  of strong bases include  hydroxides  of alkali (Group IA)
metals and lower members  of alkaline  earth metals such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and
Ba(OR),.
Examples
LiOH (aq) —> Li’ (aq) + OH" (aq)
KOH (aq) —-> K* (aq) + OH" (aq)
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS  (UNIT2)
Weak bases are those bases which ionize (dissociate)  only partially  or slightly  in aqueous
solution.  Examples  of weak bases include  NH,, and Ca(OH)..
The dissociation  of a weak base can be shown as follows  using, NH,, as an example.
NH,(g) + H,O() = NH,*(aq) + OH (aq)
The double arrow shows that the dissociation  of a weak base does not proceed  to
completion.  This means an aqueous  solution  of a weak base contains  only a small
amount  of ions derived  from the dissociation  of the base and a large amount  of the
non-ionized  base. For example,  a solution  of ammonia  containing  0.1 mole NH, per
litre of solution  ionizes  only to the extent of 1.3%.
Concentrated  and Dilute Bases
Concentrated  and dilute solutions  are terms used to describe  the amount  of a substance
present  in a given volume  of solution.  The amount  can be described  in terms of either
percentage  or number  of moles. Concentrated  bases contain  relatively  large amounts
of a base in a given volume  of solution  while dilute base solutions  contain  only a small
amount  of base. The concentration  of a base is the measure  of the number  of moles
of the alkali (base) dissolved  in one litre of solution. The concentration  is expressed
in terms of mole per litre (Molarity).
number  of moles of the base
Molarity of the base = volume of solution in litres
The greater the number  of moles of the base per litre of the solution  the more
concentrated  is the solution.  For example,  a solution  containing  ten moles of NaOH
per litre is more concentrated  than the solution  containing  two moles of NaOH  per
litre. The latter solution  is more dilute than the former.  Thus, both a strong base and a
weak base may be concentrated  or dilute depending  on the number  of moles of the
base present  per litre.
Precautions  when Handling  Bases
Strong bases such as sodium  hydroxide  and potassium  hydroxide  can attack human
skin, and even damage  animal and plant tissues. That is why NaOH and KOH are
named caustic soda and caustic potash respectively.  The word “caustic”  refers to a
substance  that can cause burning.  Thus, it is very important  to avoid the contact  of
bases with any part of our body or clothing.  Not only strong bases but weak bases
are also corrosive.  For example,  concentrated  ammonia  solution  can cause blindness  if
splashed  into the eye.
mud  — CHEMISTRYGRADE  10
The following  safety precautions  are useful in handling  bases in school laboratories  or
anywhere  while working  with them.
a Wear eye goggles,  gloves and a laboratory  coat.
If bases are spilled on your working  table wipe the spillages  immediately.
c Whenever  bases are splashed  on your cloth, wash the affected  part with running
water.
d Ifa base enters your eyes, wash with water repeatedly  as first aid treatment
and seek medical  advice.
e Ifa base is swallowed  by accident,  drink 1-2% acetic acid or lemon  juice
immediately.
f Whenever  bases come in to contact  with your skin, wash the affected  part with
plenty of water and then wash the affected  part with a very dilute solution  (about
1%) of a weak acid such as acetic acid.

Activity  2.16
1. Since water, H,O, has H* and OH,, it is both acidic and basic. Is this true?
2. If [OH] increases  in a solution  what happens  to its [H*]? Share your comments  with
your group.
pH is the measure  of the hydrogen  (H") or hydronium  (H,O") ion concentration  in a
solution.  In the same manner, pOH is the measure  of the hydroxide,  OH” ion
concentration  in a solution.  It also measures  the acidity or alkalinity  of a solution  as
pH does.
pOH is defined  as the negative  logarithm  of hydroxide,  OH’ ion concentration.
pOH = -log [OH]
To calculate  the hydroxide  ion concentration  from a given pOH value, we proceed  as
follows:
[OH-] = antilog (-pOH) = 10-P°°#
Relationship  Between  pH and pOH
How can you derive the mathematical  relationship  between  pH and pOH? To
understand  the relationship  between  pH and pOH let us start from the ionization  of
water. Water undergoes  ionization  to a small extent as follows:
H,O() = H'*(aq) + OH (aq)
= IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS  (UNIT 2) mm
or
2H,O (I) =} H,O*(aq) + OH (aq)
We can write a mathematical  expression  for the ionic product  of water or dissociation
constant  for water, Kas
K, = [H*] [OH-] = [H,0*] [OH] (2.1)
K, = 1.0 x 10-4 (mol/L)  at 25°C
Since water is neutral, [H"] = [OH] or [H,0*] = [OH]. So we can write equation
2.1 as
kK. = [H"] [OH] = [H*? = 1.0 = 10-(mol/L)?
Solving  for [H*]
[H*] = qi.o-10 (mo = 1.0107 mol/L
Thus, in any neutral aqueous  solution  at 25°C,
[H*] = [OH-] = 1.0 x 10-7 mol/L
In an acid solution,  [H*] > [OH7] and in a basic solution,  [OH-] > [H*]. However,
the product  [H*] x [OH] remains  constant,  i.e., 1.0 x 10-!4 at 25°C. Thus, if the
concentration  of either H* or OH” is known  in a given solution,  we can calculate  the
concentration  of the other.
Sw
[H"]’ [oH |
To find the relationship  between  pH and pOH let us begin with equation  2.1.
K,, = [H*] [OH] = 1.0 « 10-4 (mol/L)?
Take the negative  logarithm  of both sides
—log K, =—log  [H*] [OH] =—log 1.0 x 10
—log K. =-log  [H*] + (log [OH])  =—log 1.0 x10
but, -log K,. = pK,
—log [OH] = pOH,
log [H"] = pH
-log 1.0 x 10-4 = 14[OH] = [H"]=
So, the above equation  becomes
pk, = pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C) (2.2)
Thus, the sum of pH and pOH is 14 for any aqueous  solution,  at 25°C. Since pH,
pOH, [HTM] and [OH] are interrelated  through  K, knowing  any one of the values
enables  us to determine  the others.
Table 2.2: Acidity  and Basicity  in relation  to [H*], [OH],  pH and pOH.
Solution [H*] (mol/L) [OH7] (mol/L) pH pOH
Acidic  solution > 107 < 107 <7 >7
Basic solution < 10°” > 107 >7 <7
Example
The hydroxide  ion concentration  in a solution  is 5.0 x 10M?  Calculate:
a pOH b [H'] c pH
Solution:
a To calculate  pOH we proceed  as follows.
pOH = — log [OH"] = — log (5 x10) = — (log10~>  — log 5)
=5-log5=43
b [H’] is calculated  using the relationship

c pH =-log [H*] =-—log 2.0 x 10-!°
= 10 - log 2 = 9.7
Since the pOH of the solution  is found in part (a), we can also calculate  the
pH using the relationship
pH + pOH = 14
pH + 4.3 = 14
pH = 14-43  =9.7

1. Determine  the [OH-] in 3 x 10° M solution  of HCI.
2. Determine  the pH of 2.0 x 10° M Sr(OH),  solution  assuming  complete

Uses of Some Important  Bases
Sodium  hydroxide,  NaOH:  This is known  by the common  name lye or caustic  soda.
It is one of the most important  laboratory  and industrial  chemicals.  It is used in the
laboratory  for absorbing  carbon  dioxide  and other acidic gases, in a number  of organic
reactions  and in chemical  analysis.  Industrially,  it is used in the manufacture  of soaps
and detergents,  pulp and paper, textiles,  dyes, cosmetics,  pharmaceuticals,  in purifying
aluminium  ore and petroleum  refining.  It is also used to clean drains since it dissolves
grease and other organic  matter.
Potassium  hydroxide,  KOH: It is commonly  known  as caustic  potash. It is a stronger
base and is more expensive  than NaOH and has limited  uses. It 1s used as an electrolyte
in some dry cells and to make soft soap.
Calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH),:  It is also called slaked lime or lime water when it is
dissolved  in water. It is a weaker  base than NaOH and KOH, and is widely  used to
remove  soil acidity,  to make mortar (mixture  of lime, sand and water) which serves
as binding  material  for bricks and plastering  walls, to remove  temporary  hardness  of
water and in manufacturing  bleaching  powder.  Its aqueous  solution  is also used to test
for carbon  dioxide  gas.
Ammonia:  A solution  of gaseous  ammonia,  NH, in water is used as household  cleaning
agent and as a laboratory  reagent.  It is used to manufacture  ammonium  fertilizers,

3. Which salts are found in Dalol area, Ethiopia?
Salts are ionic compounds  that contain  positive  ions (cations)  derived  from bases and
negative  ions (anions)  derived  from acids. Salts are also defined  as ionic compounds
formed  when the ionizable  hydrogen  of acids are partly or completely  replaced  by
metal ions or ammonium  ions. For example,  Ca(HCO,),  and CaCO, are salts derived
from the acid H,CO, while the salts Mg(H,PO,),,  MgHPO,  and Mg,(PO,),  are
salts derived  from H,PO,.
¢ A salt is produced  when an acid is neutralized  by a base:
Acid + Base —> ~~ Salt + #£4Water
Examples
HCI (aq) + NaOH (aq) — NaCl(aq) + H,O (1)
H,SO, (aq) + Ca(OH),  (aq) — CaSO,(s) + 2H,0 (1)
Some common  examples  of salts are sodium chloride  (NaCl), calcium  carbonate
(CaCO,),  potassium  nitrate (KNO,),  copper sulfate (CuSO,)  etc.

©IMPORTANTINORGANIC COUMPOUNDS  (UNIT2)
fb What would be the nature  of the salt, if all the base hydroxide  ions are not replaced  by
the anions of the acid?
Discuss  in your group and present  the findings  to the class.
Salts can be classified  as:
¢ Acidic  salts: These  are salts in which  not all of the hydrogen  ions in an acid have
been replaced  by metal ions or ammonium  (NH))  ions.
Example: Sodium  hydrogen  sulphate,  NaHSO,.
When acidic salts are dissolved  to make an aqueous  solution,  they release  H*
ions which make the solution  acidic. For example,  NaHSO, releases  ions in
aqueous  solution  as follows:
NaHSO,  (aq) — Na‘(aq) + H*(aq) + SO? (aq)
* Normal  salts: These are salts in which all of the hydrogen  ions in an acid
have been replaced  by metal ions or ammonium  ions.
Example: Sodium  sulphate,  Na,SO,.
Normal  salts do not contain  ionizable  Ht or OH-.
Example
Na,SO, release ions as follows:
Na,SO,  (aq) — 2Na*(aq) + SO% (aq)
¢ Basic salts: These are salts in which not all of the hydroxide  ions in a base
have been replaced  by the anions of the acid.
Example: Zinc hydroxychloride,  Zn(OH)CL.
When basic salts are dissolved  to make an aqueous  solution,  they release OHTM
ions and this makes the solution  basic.
Zn(OH)Cl  (aq) — Zn** (aq) + OH-(aq) + CI (aq)
Preparation  of Salts
Activity  2.19
List a few methods  to prepare  sodium  chloride  in the laboratory?  Discuss  in groups  and
present  it to the class.
md  _ CHEMISTRYGRADE  10,
Salts can be prepared  by the following  methods:
1. Direct combination  of elements:  This method  is used to prepare  binary
salts, that is, salts consisting  of only two elements.
Examples
2Na(s) + ClL(g) 4 2NaCl (s)
Fe (s) + S() > FeS (s)
Fe (s) + 3CL(g) > = 2FeCl,  (s)
2. Reacting  active metals  with dilute acids:
Active metal + Acid — Salt + Hydrogen  gas
Examples
2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) — 2AICl,(aq) + 3H,(g)
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) 7 MgCl,  (aq) + H, (g)
Zn(s) + H,SO,(aq)  > ZnSO,(aq) + H, (g)
Since, the reactions  of metals of Group IA like sodium  and potassium  are very
vigorous,  it is advisable  not to use the metals of Group IA for the preparation
of salts by this method.
Sometimes,  the reaction  of active metals  with dilute acids to prepare  salts may
not be as successful  as expected.  For example,  calcium  sulphate  is only sparingly
soluble  in water. So in the reaction  with dilute sulphuric  acid, calcium  tends to
become  coated  with calctum  sulphate  which inhibits  the reaction  from proceeding.
3. Reacting  metal oxides with acids (by neutralizing  basic oxides with
dilute acids):
Metal oxide + £Dilute acid — #£Salt + £Water
Examples
CaO (s) + 2HCI (aq) > CaCl, (aq) + H,O (J)
CuO (s) + H,SO, (aq) — CuSO, (aq) + H,0 (I)
ZnO (s) + 2HNO,  (aq) — Zn(NO,),  (aq) + H,O (1)
4. Reacting  metal  hydroxides  with dilute  acids:  This reaction  is commonly  called
neutralization.
Metal hydroxides + Dilute acid — Salt + Water
Examples
NaOH (aq) + HCI (aq) —> NaCl (aq) + HAO ()
2KOH (aq) + H,SO,(aq) — ~~ K,SO, (aq) + 2H,0 (1)
5. Reacting  metal carbonates  or hydrogen  carbonates  with dilute acids:
The reaction  of carbonates  or hydrogen  carbonates  with dilute acids always
releases  carbon dioxide  gas along with the formation  of a salt and water.
Metal carbonates  + Dilute acid — Salt + Water + Carbon  dioxide
Examples
MgCO,  (s) + H,SO, (aq) — MgSO,  (aq) + CO, (g) + H,0()
CuCO, (s) + 2HCl(aq) > CuCl,(aq) + HO) + CO, (@)
Na,CO, (s) + 2HNO,  (aq) > 2NaNO,  (ag) + H,O (1) + CO, (g)
Ca(HCO,),  (s)+ 2HCI(aq) — CaCl, (aq) + 2H,O () + 2C0, (g)
6. Double decomposition  reaction  (double displacement  reaction):  In this
method,  two different  soluble  salts react to form a soluble  and an insoluble  salt
as products  that can be separated  easily.
Examples
Pb(NO,),  (aq) + Nal (aq) — Pbl, (s) + 2NaNO,  (aq)
CaCl, (aq) + Na,CO,  (aq) — CaCO, (s) + 2NaCl (aq)
It may be noted that each method  of preparing  salts cannot  be used to make
every Salt; 1.e., different  methods  may be used to make different  salts.

2. Tendency  to absorb water from the atmosphere  or release water to the
atmosphere.
@ Giemstrycrave10
Depending  on their tendency  to absorb water from or release  water to the
atmosphere,  salts can be classified  as hygroscopic,  deliquescent  and
efflorescent.
Hygroscopic  salts are those which absorb  water from the atmosphere  but remain
solid.
Deliquescent  salts absorb  water from the atmosphere  to form a solution.  The
process  of absorbing  water from the atmosphere  by  a solid to form a solution
is called deliquescence.
Efflorescent  salts lose their water of crystallization  to the atmosphere.  The
loss of water of crystallization  by solid crystals  to the atmosphere  is known  as
efflorescence.
It is very important  to note that all deliquescent  substances  are hygroscopic,
but all hygroscopic  substances  are not necessarily  deliquescent.

3. Aqueous  solutions  of soluble  salts are good conductors  of electricity,  because
they release  mobile positive  and negative  ions in solution.
Examples
NaNO, (aq) — Na‘(aq) + NO; (aq)
CaCl, (aq) — Ca*(aq) + 2Ch (aq)
4. Thermal  stability  of salts: When different  salts containing  the same anion
are heated,  they may not show similar  behaviour.  Some salts are thermally
stable while others undergo  decomposition.  The following  examples  illustrate
this fact.
a Thermal  decomposition  of carbonates:
Carbonates  are salts containing  a carbonate,  as an anion. Carbonates  of Group
IIA and most transition  metals decompose  on heating  to give the metal oxides
and carbon  dioxide:
MgCo,(s) —tt, Meo) + CO,@)
CuCO, (s) _heat_ Guo (s) + CO, (g)
However,  carbonates  of sodium  and potassium  are not decomposed  by heat.
b Thermal  decomposition  of nitrates
Nitrates  are salts containing  a nitrate, as an anion. Heating  nitrates  of Group ITA
and most transition  metals produces  a metal oxide, nitrogen  dioxide  and oxygen:
Nitrate _ heat, Metal oxide + Nitrogen dioxide + Oxygen
Examples
2Mg(NO,),  (s) “> 2MgO(s) + 4NO,(g) + 0,@)
2Pb(NO,),  (s) —w#£s 270 (s) + 4NO,(¢) + 0,@)

oxygen  gas;

The growth  and development  of plants is determined  by various  factors of soil, climate,
and by factors inherent  in the plants themselves.  Minerals  required  by plants for their
growth and development  are called plant nutrients.  For a soil to produce crops
successfully,  it must have an adequate  supply of all the necessary  nutrients  that plants
take from the soil. The required  nutrient  elements  must be present  in the soil in forms
that plants can use and also there should  be a rough balance  among  them in accordance
with the amounts  needed  by plants. When any one of these elements  is lacking  or is in
excess of the required  proportion,  the normal  plant growth  will not take place.
Elements  required  by plants for their growth  and development  are called essential
nutrients.  The elements  considered  as essential  nutrients  are carbon,  hydrogen,  oxygen,
sulphur,  nitrogen,  phosphorus,  potassium,  calcium,  magnesium,  iron, manganese,  boron,
copper, zinc, molybdenum,  cobalt and chlorine.  All these seventeen  elements  have
their own roles in the growth  and development  of plants. Depending  on the amount
required  by plants, these elements  are classified  as macronutrients  and micronutrients.
Activity  2.23
Try to identify  the (a) micronutrients,  (b) macronutrients,  required  for the growth  of wheat,
maize,  and rice crops,  by consulting  the books in your library.  Share your findings  with the
class.
Macronutrients  are the elements  required  in relatively  large amounts  by plants. These
are nitrogen,  phosphorus,  potassium,  calcium,  magnesium,  sulphur,  carbon,  hydrogen  and
oxygen.
Micronutrients  are the elements  required  by plants in relatively  small (t#7ace) amounts.
These elements  are iron, cobalt, zinc, manganese,  molybdenum,  copper,  boron and
chlorine.
The elements  carbon,  hydrogen  and oxygen  are obtained  by plants from air and water.
These are not considered  as mineral  nutrients.  Nitrogen,  phosphorous  and potassium
|IMPORTANTINORGANIC COUMPOUNDS  (UNIT2)
are said to be primary  mineral  nutrients.  The roles of nitrogen,  phosphorus  and potassium
in the plant growth  are discussed  below:
Nitrogen  is a very important  plant nutrient.  It is absorbed  by plants in the form of
nitrate ions (NO,). In the growth  and development  of plants, nitrogen  is utilized  in the
synthesis  of amino acids, proteins,  coenzymes  and nucleic  acids. The proteins  formed
control  the metabolic  processes  that occur in plant cells. Nitrogen  is also involved  in
the synthesis  of chlorophyll  to produce  a deep green colour.
Phosphorus  is an important  element  without  which  the growth  of plants is impossible.
It facilitates  early growth  and root formation,  quick maturity  and promotes  seed or
fruit production.  Phosphorus  is absorbed  by plants mainly  in the form of H,PO,  and
HPO,*  in small amounts.  Phosphorus  has a role in the formation  of some amino
acids and proteins,  coenzymes,  nucleic  acids and high energy phosphate  compounds
like Adenosine  Triphosphate  (ATP).
Potassium  is absorbed  by plants in the form of the K* ion. It is a component  of
enzymes  that facilitate  the process  of photosynthesis  and protein  synthesis.  It also adjusts
stomata  movement.  It is the most important  ion in controlling  the turgidity  of plant
cells. It increases  in the solute potential  (sap concentration)  within the cells which
leads to an increase  in the amount  of water that enters the cells osmotically.
Exercise  2.12
1. What is the importance  of the following  elements  for the growth  of food crops?
a nitrogen b phosphorus c potassium
2. In what form do plants absorb  these elements?
Fertilizers
During  the growth  and development  of plants, the plants consume  the essential  nutrients
from the soil. The concentration  of these nutrients  will decrease  in the soil. If the
plants are specially  food crops, the nutrients  can be lost from the soil when the plants
are removed  on harvest. So for the soil to be suitable  for the growth  of plants in the
next round, the nutrients  lost must be replaced.
How can we replace the nutrients  lost from the soil? How can we increase  the
crop producing  potential  of soils? The nutrients  lost from the soil can be replaced  or
the crop producing  potential  of soils can be increased  by adding  the appropriate  fertilizers
to the soil.
@  Giemstrycrave10
What are fertilizers?  Fertilizers  are materials  that are added to soils to increase  the
growth,  yield or nutrient  value of crops. Fertilizers  are usually  classified  as organic
(natural)  fertilizers  and synthetic  or artificial  fertilizers.
Organic  (natural)  fertilizers  are those derived  from animals  and plants. This includes
animal dung, urine and substances  obtained  from the decay and decomposition  of
plants. These fertilizers  provide  readily available  nutrients  to plants after some period
of decay and decomposition.  These fertilizers  can supply the elements  nitrogen,
phosphorus,  potassium  and various  trace elements  to the soil.
Synthetic  or artificial  fertilizers  contain  all three major plant nutrients  1.e., nitrogen,
phosphorous  and potassium,  and are known  as complete  fertilizers.
A mixed artificial  fertilizer  may contain  nitrogen,  phosphorus  and potassium.  Such a
type of fertiliser  is called a complete  fertiliser.  The term NPK is used to describe
fertilizers  containing  the elements  nitrogen,  phosphorus  and potassium.
Examples  of artificial  fertilizers  are ammonium  sulphate,  (NH,,),SO,,  potassium  nitrate
(KNO,),  ammonium  nitrate (NH,NO,),  and diammonium  hydrogen  phosphate,  DAP
((NH,),HPO,).
The most important  mineral  nutrients  that need to be added to the soil are usually
nitrogen,  phosphorus  and potassium.  All the three elements  are needed  in large quantities.
Commercial  fertilizers  are normally  given a “grade”,  which reflects  the percentages
they contain  of N, P and K by dry weight. For example, a NPK fertilizer  may be
described  as 10:10:10  indicating  that there is 10% of each element  in the fertilizer.  The
suitable  proportions  are best determined  in relation  to the tested fertility  of the soil and
the requirements  of the particular  crop that is being grown on it. This means fertilizers
of the same composition  are not used for different  purposes.  In nitrogen  deficient  soil,
a fertilizer  containing  a higher  percentage  of nitrogen  than phosphorus  and potassium
must be used. In addition  to this, all fertilizers  are not used for treatment  of all kinds
of soil. For example,  ammonium  sulphate  is more suitable  for use in basic soils than in
acidic or neutral soils.
Exercise  2.13
1. Classify  the following  as organic  or synthetic  fertilizers:
a NH,NO, b urea c (NH,),SO,
2. Can the same fertilizer  be applied  to all types of soil? Explain.
Pesticides
Pesticides  are chemicals  that can be applied  to agricultural  crops to kill pests which
affect the growth  and development  of plants. Parasitic  fungi, insects and animals  like
rodents,  rabbits and birds reduce crop yields or even completely  destroy crops.
>
Pesticides  are used to overcome  the damage  caused  by fungi and pests. The majority
of the pesticides  used in agriculture  are organic  compounds.  However,  there are some
inorganic  substances  that serve as pesticides.  These include  fumigant  insecticides  that
exist in the vapour  phase. Examples  of fumigants  are hydrogen  cyanide  (HCN),  sulphur
dioxide  (SO,), carbon disulphide  (CS,) and phosphine  (PH,). These pesticides  are
mostly  used in the treatment  of empty transport  containers,  grain stores, warehouses,
harvested  products  prior to or during storage and to destroy  pests in the soil. The
other inorganic  pesticides  are mostly copper compounds  such as CuCl,, Cu(OH),,
Cu(NO,),,  CuSO,, Cu,O and CuCO,.  Among  the inorganic  compounds,  CuSO,
and Cu,O are used as fungicides  where as HCN, SO,, PH,, CuCl,, Cu(OH),,
Cu(NO,),  and CuCO, are used as insecticides.
Herbicides
Herbicides  are also called weed killers. They are used to control  the damage  caused
by weeds. Inorganic  compounds  used as herbicides  include  ammonium  sulphamate
((NH,)SO,—-NH,),  borax (Na,B,O,-10H,O),  sodium  chlorate  (NaClO,)  and ferrous
sulphate  (FeSO,-7H,O).

Activity  3.1
Discuss the following  in groups  and one of your group members  will present  your ideas
to the class.
Dry cells which we use in portable  radios and flashlights  are energy  converters.
a Peel the external  cover of a dry cell battery  and observe  the components.  How many
different  components  do you see? What are they?
b What type of energy do we get from dry cells? How does the cell generate  this
energy?
Electrochemistry  is a field of chemistry  that deals with the relationship  between
electrical  energy and chemical  energy. It is a field of chemistry  concerned  with
processes  that bring about chemical  reactions  (changes)  using electricity  or generating
electrical  energy from chemical  reactions.  Thus, electrical  energy and chemical  energy
are inter-convertible.
The devices  that convert  chemical  energy  to electrical  energy or electrical  energy to
chemical  energy are called electrochemical  cells. These cells can be classified  as
electrolytic  cells and galvanic  or voltaic cells. Electrolytic  cells use electrical  energy  to
bring about chemical  changes  that produce  many desirable  substances  in our daily
lives. Galvanic  or voltaic cells convert  chemical  energy to electrical  energy. The cells
we use in flashlight  batteries,  wrist watches,  cameras  and car batteries  are examples
of Galvanic  cells. The reactions  between  the chemicals  in these cells are responsible
for the generation  of electricity.
Electrochemistry  has practical  applications  in our modern  world and in everyday  life.
Electrolysis  is used to manufacture  metals like sodium,  aluminium;  non-metals  like
chlorine,  hydrogen  and compounds  like sodium  hydroxide  and sodium  hypochlorite.
Electrochemistry  also has a role in the production  of dry cells and lead storage
batteries  used in the automotive  industry.

¢ explain  electrolytic  conductivity;
¢ distinguish  between  metallic  and electrolytic  conduction;

Why do metals conduct  electricity?  Do you know any non-metal,  which conducts
electricity?  Electrical  conductivity  is the capacity  of a substance  to transmit  electricity.
The materials  that allow the passage  of electricity  through  them are called electrical
conductors.
Conductivity  apparatus  is used to test the conductivity  of different  solid substances  or
that of aqueous solutions of different compounds.  The basic components  of
conductivity  apparatus  include  electric  wires, electrodes,  a d.c. source or dry cells, a
switch and light bulb. The components  of the apparatus  can be connected  to one
another  as shown in Figure 3.1.

Depending  on the nature of the particles  responsible  for the flow of electric  charges
through  conductors,  electrical  conductivity  can be classified  as metallic  conductivity  or
electrolytic  conductivity.
a) Metallic  conductivity
Activity  3.2
1. With the help of your teacher  collect pieces of iron bars, zinc metal, sodium  chloride
crystal,  rubber  stoppers,  rubber  bands,  coins, stone,  glass, pieces of dry wood, a spoon,  a

you think some of the materials  conduct  electricity?  (c) Does graphite  have the same
nature  as the other conductors  of electricity?
Discuss  in groups  and present  it to the class
Why do metals transmit  electric  current?  What are the charge carriers in metals?
Metallic  conductivity  refers to the transmission  of electric  current  through  metals. This
transmission  is directly  related  to the structure  of metals. In atoms of metals, the
valence  electrons  are bounded  very loosely  to their respective  nuclei and move very
easily throughout  the metal. This means metals contain  electrons  that do not have fixed
positions  and are relatively  free to move. These electrons  are called free electrons  or
mobile electrons  or delocalized  electrons.  Thus, the structure  of the metals can be
regarded  as a series of positively  charged  metal ions, or cations,  in a sea of negatively
charged  electrons.
Free Electrons Nucleus
Figure  3.2 Electrical  conductivity  in metals.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY  (UNIT 3) mm
The electrons  entering  the metal displace  (repel)  the freely moving  electrons  at the
point of entry. The displaced  electrons  occupy  new positions  by pushing  neighbouring
electrons  ahead. This will continue  until electrons  are forced out of the wire at the
opposite  end. So, metallic  conductivity  is caused  by the flow of mobile  electrons  due
to repulsion  exerted  on them from the electrons  entering  the metal from the source of
electricity.  The charge carriers  in metallic  conduction  are electrons.  Hence,  metallic
conductivity  is also called electronic  conductivity.
Non-metals  are generally  non-conductors  of electricity,  because  they do not have freely
moving  electrons.  Graphite  is a form of carbon  in which  the carbon  atoms  are bonded  in
trigonal  planar  fashion  to the three other  carbon  atoms,  to form inter-connected  hexagonal
rings, as shown  in Figure3.3.  Electrons  move  freely  through  the hexagonal  layers,  making
graphite  a good conductor  of electricity.
Figure  3.3 Structure  of graphite  (The blue colour  is added  to emphasize  the planarity  of the carbon  layers.)
b) Electrolytic  conductivity
Electrolytes  are substances  that transmit  electricity  in a molten  state or in aqueous
solution.  Based on their degree of ionization  or the extent to which they produce
anions and cations, electrolytes  can be classified  as strong electrolytes  or weak
electrolytes.  Strong electrolytes  ionize almost  completely  in aqueous  solutions.  Weak
electrolytes  ionize only slightly. When electrical  potential  is applied  through  an
electrolyte  solution,  the positive  ions (cations)  move in one direction  and the negative
ions (anions)  move in the opposite  direction.  This movement  of ions through  the
electrolyte,  brought  about by the application  of electricity,  is called electrolytic
conductivity.  Hence,  the charge-carriers  in electrolytic  conductivity  are ions (anions
and cations).

you will need a light bulb, three dry cells, some electric  wire, two graphite

The substances  that do not transmit  electricity  either in solution  or in a molten  state are
called non-electrolytes.  Ionic compounds  are non-conductors  of electricity  in the solid
state. This is because  their ions are held at fixed positions  and cannot  move. Other
examples  of non-electrolytes  include  sugar, ethanol,  oil, benzene,  and liquid nitrogen.

Activity  3.3
Give an opinion  on the following  questions  and present  your ideas to the class.
1. How do you identify  whether  an electrode  is a cathode  or an anode?
2. Can you suggest  why positive  and negative  ions are named as cations and anions
respectively?
Electrolysis  is a process  in which electrical  energy is used to produce  chemical
changes.  This process is carried out in an electrochemical  cell known as an
electrolytic  or electrolysis  cell. A typical electrolysis  cell contains  a source of direct
electric  current, an electrolyte  and connecting  wires that join the source to the
electrodes.
Electrodes  are strips of metal or graphite  that allow electrons  to leave or enter the
electrolytes.  They can be chemically  active or inert. Active electrodes  directly  take
part in reactions.  Examples  include  zinc and magnesium.  Inert electrodes  do not
directly take part in chemical  reactions.  They only serve to transfer electrons.
Examples  include  platinum  and graphite.
The electrode  connected  to the positive  terminal  of the source is positively  charged
and is called the anode. It is the electrode  through  which electrons  leave the cell. The
electrode  connected  to the negative  terminal  of the source is negatively  charged  and is
called the cathode.  It is the electrode  through  which electrons  enter the cell.
During  electrolysis,  the ions of the electrolyte  migrate  to the electrodes  of the opposite
charge. The positive  ions are attracted  to the cathode  and are called cations. Since
the cathode  has excess electrons,  the cations  will discharge  by gaining  electrons.  This
process  of gaining  electrons  is called  reduction.  The negative  ions are attracted  by the
positive  electrode  (anode)  and are called anions. These ions are discharged  by losing
electrons  at the anode. This process  of losing electrons  is called oxidation.
Thus, the cathode  is the electrode  at which reduction  occurs and the anode is the
electrode  at which oxidation  takes place.
CTR CHEMISTRY  UNITS)
The reaction  that takes place at each electrode  is known  as a half-cell  reaction.  Oxidation
half-reactions  occur at the anode and reduction  half reaction  at the cathode.  The net
reaction  that takes place in the electrolytic  cell is known  as a cell reaction.  This overall
reaction  is also referred  to as an oxidation-reduction  reaction  or redox reaction.  So
electrolysis  is a process  in which electric  energy is used to bring about an oxidation-
reduction  reaction.  It is also defined  as the decomposition  of an electrolyte,  using electricity.
The process of electrolysis  includes  electrolyzing  aqueous  solutions  of electrolytes.
However,  at this level, electrolysis  of molten  electrolytes  will be discussed.
Electrolysis  of Molten  (Fused)  Electrolytes
When ionic solids melt, they dissociates  into positive  and negative  ions that are not
held in fixed positions.  To understand  the chemical  reactions  that occur during
electrolysis,  consider  a hypothetical  electrolyte,  MX, that dissociate  into M* and X~.
Mx melting : Mt 4 xX
During  electrolysis,  the cations,  M* ions, move toward  the cathode,  gain one electron
each and become M atoms. The anions,  X- ions, move toward  the anode, lose one
electron  and become  X atoms. The reaction  at each electrode  and the entire reaction
in the electrolytic  cell are represented  by the following  equations.
Cathode  reaction: M* + le’ > M (Reduction-half  reaction)
Anode reac tion: xX> X + le” (Oxidation  half-reaction)
Cell reaction: Mt + XS" 5M + X (Oxidation-reduction)
Anode  (+) Cathode  (—)
Electrolyte
Figure  3.5 Electrolysis  of fused  Electrolyte,  MX.
Here, it is very important  to realize that the number  of electrons  gained  by the cations
at the cathode  is exactly  equal to the number  of electrons  lost by anions at the anode
during electrolysis.  This is true for any oxidation-reduction  (redox) reaction.
Moreover,  oxidation  and reduction  reactions  proceed  simultaneously.  Reduction  and
oxidation  cannot  occur separately.  Oxidation  is always accompanied  by reduction  and
there cannot  be reduction  in the absence  of oxidation,  and vice versa.

Activity  3.4
Discuss  the following  and present  your ideas to the class:
1. Have you seen the expiry date written on dry cells? Can we get the expected  amount
of electric  energy  after the expiry date of the cell; why?
2. Do we throw away car batteries  when they fail to generate  electricity?  Explain.
3. Galvanic  cells available  in the market have positive  and negative  terminals.  Does this
show that they also possess  an anode and cathode?
In the previous  section,  electrolytic  cells were defined  as electrochemical  cells in which
electricity  was used to bring about chemical  reactions.  The chemical  reaction  in an
electrolytic  cell is caused  by electricity  and is a non-spontaneous  redox reaction.  This
means the reaction  can proceed  only in the presence  of electricity.  If we stop passing
electricity  through  the electrolyte,  the reaction  will stop.
In a Galvanic  cell, the reaction  that occurs inside the cell is a spontaneous  redox
reaction.  The reaction  that occurs inside the cell will proceed  on its own without  any
171
@&— cHemistryeraveto
external influence.  This reaction  enables a galvanic  cell to generate  electricity.
Therefore,  Galvanic  cells are electrochemical  cells in which spontaneous  redox
reactions  generate  electricity.  They convert  chemical  energy into electrical  energy.
Galvanic  or voltaic cells are classified  into primary  cells, secondary  cells, and fuel
cells. For this level, only primary  and secondary  cells will be discussed.
Primary  Cells
Primary  galvanic  cells are those cells that are not rechargeable.  This is because  the
electrode  reaction  as well as the entire cell reaction  cannot  be reversed  on recharging.
Once the chemicals  in the cells that serve as reactants  are completely  used up, it is
not possible  to recover  them by charging  the cells. Examples  of primary  cells include
Daniel’s  cell and zinc-carbon  (Leclanche)  dry cells. The common  feature of all
Galvanic  cells is that they contain  two electrodes  in contact  with an electrolyte.  The
electrolyte  in a Galvanic  cell can be in the form of a solution  or a paste. The cells
containing  electrolytes  in the form of solution  are called wet cells, and those containing
electrolytes  in the form of paste are called dry cells.
An example  of a wet primary  cell is the Daniell  cell. It consists  of a zinc strip placed
in ZnSO, solution  in one compartment  and a copper strip placed in copper  sulphate,
CuSO,,  solution  in another  compartment.  Each compartment  is called a half-cell,  and
the reactions  occurring  in each compartment  are called half-cell  reactions.  The
solutions  in the two compartments  are linked by a salt bridge as shown in Figure 3.7.
The salt bridge consists  of a delivery  tube filled with warm mixture  of conc. KCl
solution  and agar solution,  which is then allowed  to cool so that it sets in the form of
a gel.
Alternately,  a porous barrier is used to separate  the solutions.  The zinc atoms from the
zinc electrode  lose two electrons  each and become  zinc ions, Zn**. The ions enter
into the solution,  and the electrons  remain  on the electrode  and flow through  the
external  wire to the copper  electrode.  This situation  causes the zinc electrode  to be
negative  and the solution  to have an overall  positive  charge.
On the other hand, in the compartment  containing  the copper  electrode,  copper  ions,
Cu’, from the solution  move to the cathode  and gain two electrons  each, to become
copper atoms and deposit  on the surface of the copper electrode.  This condition
causes the electrode  to be positive  and the solution  to have a negative  charge.

Note that the anode is the negative  electrode  and the cathode  is the positive  electrode
in galvanic  cells, as opposed  to the situation  in an electrolytic  cell. But, it is always
oxidation  that occurs at the anode and reduction  at the cathode.
The half-cell  reactions  and the cell reaction  in Daniell  cells are represented  as
Anode reaction:  Zn (s) — Zn** (aq) + 2e7
Cathode  reaction:  Cu** (aq) + 2e7 > Cu (s)
Cell reaction:  Zn (s) + Cu** (aq) — Zn?* (aq) + Cu (s)
Due to the oxidation-reduction  reaction  in the cell, the Daniell  cell generates  electricity.
What is the purpose  of the salt bridge in Figure 3.7?
From the preceding  discussion,  it is clear that the solution  in which the zinc electrode
is placed  has an overall  positive  charge while the solution  in the copper  compartment
has a negative  charge. Unless  the two solutions  are neutral,  the cell cannot  produce
electricity.  Thus, the purpose  of the salt bridge is to:
a maintain  electrical  neutrality  between  the two solutions.  In this process  the anions
(negative  ions) from the salt bridge diffuse into the solution  containing  the zinc
electrodes,  and the cations (positive  ions) diffuse into the solution  containing
the copper  electrode  to compensate  for the excess positive  and negative  charges,
respectively;
b__ allow electrical  contact  between  the two solutions;
¢ prevent  mixing  of the electrode  solutions.
Although,  wet cells like the Daniell  cell can serve as a source of electricity,  they are
not portable  since they contain  solutions.  Due to this practical  problem  of using wet
cells, dry cells were developed.
In a dry cell, a moist electrolyte  paste is used instead  of solutions.  This cell was
invented  by Georges  Leclanche,  a French  chemist.
A zinc-carbon  dry cell, which is also called a Leclanche  cell (Figure  3.8) is used in
devices  like portable  radios and flashlights.  The cell consists  of a zinc cup that serves
as the anode. The zinc cup is filled with a paste of manganese  (IV) oxide, zinc
chloride,  ammonium  chloride  and powdered  carbon.  A graphite  rod, immersed  in this
paste, serves as the cathode.

A build up of ammonia  gas around  the cathode  may disrupt  the current.  However,  this
is prevented  by the reaction between Zn?* and NH; to form a complex ion,

There are other examples  of dry cells, such as the alkaline  dry cell, silver oxide cell,
and copper  oxide cell.

Secondary  Cells
Unlike  primary  cells, secondary  cells are rechargeable.  The electrode  reactions  can be
reversed,  and the original  reactants  can be regenerated.  This can be achieved  by passing
a direct current  through  the cell. The process  is called charging  or recharging.
A secondary  cell needs to be recharged  when it stops producing  electricity.  A lead
storage  battery  is an example  of a secondary  cell.
A lead Storage  Battery  is the common  automobile  battery  that usually  delivers  either 6
or 12 volts, depending  on the number  of cells used in its construction.  The inside of
the battery consists  of galvanic  cells connected  in series. A fully-charged  lead-acid  cell
is made up of a stack of alternating  lead and lead (IV) oxide plates isolated  from each
other by porous separators.  The individual  cells contain  a number  of lead anodes
connected  together,  plus a number of cathodes  composed  of PbO,, also joined

electrolyte.
A single lead-storage  cell delivers  2 volts. Therefore,  a 12 V battery  contains  six cells

Figure  3.9 Lead - Storage  Battery.
When  a lead-storage  battery  is in operation  (on discharge),  the following  reactions
occur at the electrodes:
Anode reactions: Pb (s) + SO% (aq) — PbSO, (s) + 2e
Cathode  reactions:  PbO, (s) + 4H* (aq) + SO7 (aq) + 2e” > PbSO, (s) + 2H,O (1)
and the overall  reaction  is:
Pb (s) + PbO, (s) + 4H* (aq) 2SO7 (aq) > 2PbSO,  (s) + 2H,O (I)
From the electrode  reactions  it can be noticed that PbSO, is produced  at both
electrodes.
Unlike primary  cells a lead-storage  battery is rechargeable  when the battery  runs
down. The electrode  reactions  can be reversed  by placing a potential  across the
electrodes  that is slightly  larger than that which the battery  can deliver. The reaction
that takes place on recharging  a lead storage battery is given by the following
equation.
2PbSO,  (s) + 2H,O (1) > Pb (s) + PbO, (s) + 2H,SO,  (aq)

Each day, our lives are touched  directly  or indirectly  by the products  of electrolysis.
Electrolysis  has important  industrial  applications.  It is used for:
a) The production  of chemicals  like sodium hydroxide,  from
electrolysis  of brine (concentrated  NaCl solution),  using
inert electrodes.
The reactions  that take place at the electrodes  (when graphite  electrodes  are used)
are as follows:
Anode reaction:  2CI (aq) — Cl, (g) + 2e
Cathode  reaction:  2H,O (1) + 2e° — H, (g) + 20H (aq)
The overall cell reaction  is:

ELECTROCHEMISTRY  (UNIT 3) >
b) For the production  of metals and non-metals.
The non-metals  like H,, Cl,, F, etc are manufactured  on an industrial  scale by the
process  called electrolysis.  The metal aluminium  is extracted  industrially  by the Hall
Process.  This process  involves  the electrolysis  of molten  alumina  (Al,O,)  mixed with
some amount  of cryolite,  Na,AIF,.  The role of cryolite  is to reduce  the melting  point
of alumina  from 2000°C to 1000°C. The vessel holding the molten mixture
(Figure 3.8) is made up of iron lined with carbon, which serves as the cathode.
Carbon  (graphite)  rods that serve as the anode are inserted  into the melt. When the
molten  mixture  is electrolyzed,  pure aluminium  is produced.  The reactions  at the
electrodes  are:
Anode reaction: 607 (1) — 30, (g) + 12e€
Cathode  reaction:  4Al*(1) + 12e — 4Al(l)
Overall  reaction: 4Al*(1) + 607(1) > 30,(g) + 4Al()

Another  important  application  of electrolysis  is the purification  of metals like copper.
When first separated  from its ore, copper  metal is about 99% pure with nickel, silver,
gold and platinum  as major impurities.  In the refining  process,  the impure copper is
used as the anode, copper  metal of high purity used as cathode,  and copper sulphate,
CuSO, solution  and aqueous  H,SO, as the electrolyte.
When electrolysis  is carried  out, copper  and impurities  that are more easily oxidized
than copper, such as nickel, will go into the solution.  Copper  passes through  the
solution  and deposits  on the cathode,  while the impurities  remain  in solution.  Impurities
like silver and gold are less easily oxidized  and do not dissolve  but fall away from the
anode as ‘sludge’.  The electrode  reaction  in the purification  of copper is the following:
Anode reaction:  Cu(s) > Cu**(aq)+2e
Cathode  reaction:  Cu**(aq)+2e  — Cu(s)
During  the process,  the size of the impure copper anode decreases  and that of the
pure copper cathode  increases.

Always  remember  that, in the purification  of metals by electrolysis,  the impure  metal
should be used as the anode, the pure form of the metal as the cathode and an
electrolyte  should contain  soluble salt (ions) of the metal to be purified.  The process
of purifying  metals by electrolysis  is called electrorefining.

d) Electroplating
Activity  3.8
When zinc electrode  is dipped in copper  sulphate  solution,  part of the electrode  in the
solution  will be covered with a reddish brown layer of copper.  Can this process be
considered  as electroplating?  Explain.  Discuss  in groups  and present  your opinion  to the
class.
What is the purpose  of electroplating?
Electroplating  is a process  of covering  the surface of a metal (metal  article)  with a
thin layer of another  metal. Using this process,  metals that easily corrode  can be
protected  by a thin coating  of another  metal that resists corrosion.  For example,  tin
cans are steel cans with a thin coating  of tin, and chrome-plated  bumpers  are used for
automobiles.  Thus, the main objective  of electroplating  is to protect  an article from
corrosion  and to give articles a beautiful  appearance.  In the process  of electroplating,
the pure plating metal should be used as the anode, the article (metal)  to be plated
the as cathode  and a solution  containing  ions of the plating  metal as the electrolyte.
For example,  to produce  a silver-plated  copper article, say, a medal, one should
use silver as the anode, the copper  medal as the cathode  and silver nitrate solution  as
the electrolyte  (Figure  3.12).

A chemical  industry  is an institution  involved  in the production  of chemical  products.  The
chemical  industry  involves  the use of chemical  processes  such as chemical  reactions  and
refining  methods  to produce  a wide variety  of materials  with desirable  properties  and
quality  to satisfy  social needs. Most of these products,  in turn, can be used by other
chemical  industries  to manufacture  other items or can be used directly  by consumers.
Generally,  chemical  industries:

What are natural resources?ek WRN
Explain the importance  of natural resources  for chemical  industries  with examples.
Discuss  in group and present  your opinion  to the class.
Natural  resources  can be classified  as renewable  and non-renewable  resources.  Renewable
resources  are resources  that can be replenished  (replaced)  by natural  processes.  These
resources  can be renewed  at the same rate at which  they are used. Plants,  animals,  soil and
water  are examples  of renewable  resources.  Non-renewable  resources  are resources  that
are found  in a fixed amount  in nature  and cannot  be replenished.  These  resources  can be
completely  used up within  some decades  and cannot  be replaced  easily.  Examples  of non-
renewable  resources  include  natural  gas, and coal. Generally,  any chemical  industry  utilizes
either  natural  resource  as starting  materials,  or other  substances  obtained  from  natural  resources
after processing,  as araw material,  for its manufacturing  activity.

A. Aluminium
Occurrence  and extraction
Aluminium  is the most  abundant  metal  and the third  most  plentiful  element  after oxygen  and
silicon  in the earth’s  crust.  About  seven  percent  of the earth’s  crust is aluminium.  It is the
second-most  important  metal,  after iron, in terms of consumption.  Aluminium  does not
occur  as a free metal in nature.  Its principal  ore is bauxite  (Al,O,-2H,O).  Other  minerals
containing  aluminium  are orthoclase  (KAISi,O,),  cryolite  (Na,  AIF),  corundum  (AL O,),
beryl (Be,ALSi,O,)  and china  clay (AI,S1,0,-2H,O).
Aluminium  is extracted  industrially  principally,  from bauxite,  Al,O,*2H,O,  by the Hall—
Héroult  process  or simply  the Hall process.  In this process,  first the bauxite  needs  to be
purified  since it is frequently  contaminated  with silica  (SiO.),  iron oxides  and titanium  (IV)
oxide. To isolate  pure Al O, from bauxite,  the powdered  ore is first heated  with sodium
hydroxide  solution  to convert  silica  into a soluble  silicate.
SiO,(s) + 2NaOH(aq) — _ Na,SiO,(aq) + H,O()
At the same time aluminium  oxide is converted  to soluble  sodium  aluminate.
ALO,(s) + 2NaOH(aq) — _ NaAlO,(aq) + HO)
The impurities  like iron oxides  and titanium  (IV) oxide  remain  unaffected  by the base and
are filtered  off. Why are they not affected?
Then  the solution  is treated  with acid to precipitate  aluminium  hydroxide.
AlO, (aq) + H,O*(aq) —> AI(OH),(s)
Aluminium  hydroxide  is collected  by filtration,  washed,  dried, and then heated  strongly  in
a furnace  to get ALO,,.
2A(OH), —,  alo, + 3H,0
Pure aluminium  oxide is mixed  with some cryolite, Na, AIF’, and then melted.  Cryolite  is
added  to AIO,  to reduce  its melting  point  from 2045°C  to 1000°C.  The molten  mixture  is
then electrolyzed  to obtain  aluminium.  The electrolytic  cell, in which  the molten  mass is
electrolyzed,  contains  graphite  electrodes  as both anode  and cathode.
1. Write the balanced  chemical  equation  for the dissociation  of aluminium  oxide in the
molten  state.
2. Identify  the ions that move to the cathode  and the anode during the electrolysis  of
molten aluminium  oxide? Write the half-reactions  at the anode, cathode  and overall
cell reactions.
3. At which electrode  will aluminium  be produced  during the process?

ALO, is converted  to Al, by electrolysis.  We do not use reducing  agents  for reduction
of aluminium  from aluminium  oxide; why?
Physical  Properties:  Aluminium  1s a soft silvery-white  metal having  a density  of 2.7
g/cm’.  It melts at 660°C.  It can be shaped  into wires,  rolled,  pressed  or cast into different
shapes.  It is a good conductor  of heat and electricity.
Chemical  Properties:  Aluminium  is a reactive  metal,  even though  its reactions  are not
vigorous  in comparison  with those of sodium,  potassium,  calcium  and other  metals  of
group  IA and ITA. It undergoes  the following  reactions:
a Reaction  with Oxygen:
Aluminium  has affinity  for oxygen  and reacts  with atmospheric  oxygen  to form a thin
film of aluminium  oxide  on its surface.
4Al(s) + 30,(2) > 2AL,0,()
— @&— cemisraycrapeno
This thin film of oxide inhibits  further  reaction  with oxygen.  The thin film can be
removed  by rubbing  with mercury  or mercury  (II) chloride  solution.
What  type of oxide is Al,O,?
b Reaction  with dilute acids:
Aluminium  reacts  with dilute acids like HCl and H,SO,,  forming  salts and liberating
hydrogen  gas.
2Al(s) + 3H,SO,(aq) — AL(SO,),(aq)  + 3H,(g)
2Al(s) + 6HCI (aq) —> 2AICL,(s) + 3H,(g)
Aluminium  does not react  with dilute  or concentrated  HNO,  due to the formation  of
a protective  oxide  layer  on its surface.
c Aluminium  burns in chlorine  gas to form aluminium  chloride:
2Al(s) + 3CL(g) > 2AlCL,(s)
ad Aluminium  reacts with sodium  hydroxide  solution:
2Al(s) + 2NaOH  (aq) + 6H,O(J) — 2NaAl(OH),(aq)  + 3H,(g)
Uses: Aluminium  is lightweight  and corrosion  resistant,  so it is used  to make light alloys
like duralumin  (mixture  ofAl, Cu and Mg).  Alloys  of aluminium  are extensively  used in the
transport  industry  to make aircraft,  ships and cars. It is used in the manufacture  of  household
cooking  utensils  due to its high thermal  conductivity  and resistance  to corrosion.  It is also
used to make door and window  frames  and roofing  for buildings,  as packaging  material  in
food industries,  and for electrical  transmission  lines.
In the thermite  welding  process,  powdered  aluminium  when  mixed  with iron (IIT) oxide
and ignited,  produces  a temperature  of about  3000°C.  This temperature  is quite sufficient
for welding  metals.  The reaction  in this process  is as follows:
2Al(s) + FeO,(s) — 2Fe(l) + ALO,(s)
The mixture  of powdered  aluminium  and iron oxide is called  thermite.

B. Iron
Occurrence  and Extraction
Iron is the second-most  abundant  metal  next to aluminium,  in the earth’s  crust and it is the
fourth  most abundant  element.  It constitutes  about  4.7%  of the earth’s  crust by weight.  It
is never  found  as a free metal in nature.  It occurs  in nature  only in the form of compounds,
such as oxides,  carbonates  and sulphides.  The chief  ores of iron are hematite  (Fe,O,),
limonite  (Fe,O,-H,O),  magnetite  (Fe,O,,),  and siderite  (FeCO,).  It is also found  in the
form of iron pyrites  (FeS,)  which  is commonly  called  fool’s gold.
Iron is generally  extracted  from hematite  (Fe,O,),  magnetite  (Fe,O,,)  and siderite  (FeCO,).
The extraction  of iron from its ores is carried  out in a blast furnace.  The raw materials  for
the extraction  of iron are iron ore, coke, limestone  and hot air. The furnace  is charged  with
amixture  of iron ore, limestone  and coke at the top and a blast of hot air is blown  in at the
bottom.  The coke burns  to form carbon  dioxide  and the temperature  approaches  2000°C
near the bottom.  As the carbon  dioxide  rises up, the coke reduces  it to carbon  monoxide.
The carbon  monoxide  then reduces  the iron oxide  to iron metal. The overall  reactions  in
the blast furnace  can be summarized  as follows:
1. Oxidation  of coke to carbon  dioxide:
C(s) + Og) > CO,(g) + heat
2. Reduction  of carbon  dioxide  to carbon  monoxide:
CO,(g) + C(s) +> 2CO(g)
3. Reduction  of iron oxides  to metallic  iron by carbon  monoxide:
3Fe,O,(s) + CO(g) > 2Fe,0O,(s) + CO,(g)
Fe,O,(s) + CO(g) + 3FeO(s) + CO,(g)
FeO(s) + CO(g) - Fe(l) + CO,(g)

5. Reaction  of calcium  oxide with impurities  like silica (SiO,) to form calcium  silicate
which  is a glass-like  material  called  slag.
CaO + $10, + CaSiO,
The molten iron flows to the bottom of the blast furnace. The slag is less dense and floats
on the surface of the molten iron. Thus, the molten iron and the molten slag are tapped off
separately.  The slag is used mostly for the manufacture  of cement

The iron obtained  directly  from  the blast  furnace  is called  pig iron. It is impure  and contains
about  2% silicon,  up to 1% phosphorus  and manganese,  and traces  of sulphur.  These
impurities  make  pig iron brittle.  When  pig iron is re-melted  with scrap iron and cast into
moulds,  it forms  cast iron.
Wrought  iron: is the purest  form of commercial  iron. It is obtained  by removing  most of
the impurities  from pig iron. It is manufactured  by heating  impure  iron with hematite  and
limestone  in a furnace.  This increases  the purity  of the iron to 99.5%. Wrought  iron is a
tough,  malleable  and ductile  form of iron.
PROJECT  4.1
Form a group and construct  a model of the blast furnace  from locally available
materials.
Conversion  of Pig Iron to Steel
The relatively  high carbon-content  of the iron recovered  from  the blast furnace  (pig iron)
makes  it very hard and brittle.  The conversion  of  pig iron to steel 1s essentially  a purification
process  in which  impurities  are removed  by oxidation.  This purification  process  is carried
out in a furnace  at high temperatures.  In the conversion  of pig iron to steel, three different
methods  are used. These are the Bessemer  Converter,  Open-hearth  Furnace  and the
Basic  Oxygen  Process.
a The Bessemer  Converter:  In the process  of converting  pig iron to steel, molten
pig iron from the blast furnace  is transferred  to a cylindrical  vessel  containing  a
refractory  lining  of MgCO,  and CaCO,,.  A blast of hot air is blown  through  the
molten  metal from a set of small holes at the bottom  of the vessel.  The oxygen
passing  through  the molten  metal converts  silicon,  phosphorus  and sulphur  to their
oxides,  which  then react  with the lining  to form aslag. The carbon  in the pig iron is
also oxidized  to carbon  monoxide,  so its concentration  is also reduced.  The
conversion  of  the pig iron to steel by this process  requires  only 15 minutes.  However,
the reaction  1s difficult  to control  and the quality  of the steel produced  can be quite
variable.
b The Open-hearth  Furnace:  It has a large, shallow  hearth,  which  is usually  lined
with a basic oxide  refractory  (MgO  and CaO). The furnace  is charged  with a mixture
of pig iron, Fe,O,,  scrap iron and limestone.  A blast of hot air and burning  fuel is
directed  over  the surface  of  the charge  to maintain  it in the molten  state. Impurities  in
the pig iron are oxidized  by the Fe,O, and air. Carbon  dioxide,  and sulphur  dioxide
formed  by the oxidation  of the carbon  and sulphur,  respectively,  in the pig iron
bubble  out of the mixture  as waste  gases.
197
— @&— cemisavcrapeno
The SiO, and other acidic  oxides  like P,O,,, combine  with CaO (from limestone)  and the
refractory  lining  to form aslag.
The impurities  in pig iron are oxidized  in the following  way:
Cc 6+ (OO, > CO,
S + O, > So,
12P + 10Fe,0, > 3P,0, + 20Fe
3Si + 2Fe0, > 3810, + 4Fe
Calcium  oxide,  formed  by the decomposition  of limestone,  reacts  with oxides  of silicon
and phosphorus  to form slag.
PO, + 6Ca0 > 2Ca(PO,),4~ 10
SiO, + CaO > CaSiO,
This entire process  takes 8 to 10 hours  to complete  and the quality  of the steel is much
more easily  controlled.  A calculated  amount  of various  elements  can be added  to the steel
to form steel alloys  with desired  properties.

¢c Basic Oxygen  Process:  This newer procedure  has largely  replaced  the open
hearth, because  of its high speed. It involves  forcing  a mixture  of powdered
calcium  oxide, CaO, and oxygen  gas directly  into the surface of the molten
pig iron. The oxygen  reacts exothermically  with carbon, sulphur,  silicon,
phosphorus  and impurity  metals. Carbon  and sulphur  are oxidized  to CO, and
SO,, respectively,  and are released  as exhaust  gases. The oxides of silicon
(SiO,), phosphorus,  (P,O,,) and impurity  metals combine  with lime (CaO),
forming  slag. The charge in the converter  is maintained  in the molten  state by
the energy  released  in these oxidation  reactions.  The converter  is tilted to
remove  the slag. After a second  blow of oxygen,  the converter  is tilted once
again and the molten  steel is poured  out. This process  takes only about 20
to 25 minutes.

Physical  Properties  of Iron
Do you remember  physical  properties  of iron? Can you mention  some of them?
Iron is a grey, lustrous,  malleable  and ductile  metal.  It is a good conductor  of heat and
electricity.  It has a high melting  point (1580°C)  and a high density  (7.87 g/cm’).  It is a
ferromagnetic  metal,  which  means  it can be permanently  magnetized.
Chemical  Properties  of Tron
Have  you ever noticed  the formation  of a reddish  thin film on the surface  of an
iron object?  Do you know the chemical  nature of this thin film? From  your
observations,  what do you conclude  about  the reactivity  of iron?
Iron is areactive  metal. Its reactivity  is very slow, compared  to group  IA and IIA metals.
Iron rusts in the presence  of air and moisture  to form hydrated  iron (II) oxide.
AFe(s) + 30, (g) moisture y 2Fe,O, .x H,O(s) (rust)
Iron reacts  with dilute acids, like HCI and H,SO,,  forming  iron (II) salts and liberating
hydrogen  gas.
Fe (s) + 2HCl(aq) —- FeCl, (aq) + H,(g)
Fe (s) + H,SO,(aq) — FeSO, (aq) + H,(g)
Like other  transition  metals,  iron also exhibits  different  oxidation  states.  It commonly  exists
as the ferrous  (Fe?") and ferric (Fe**) ions. Iron (ID) and iron (IID) compounds  are coloured.
Aqueous  solutions  of iron (II) compounds  are pale-green  and solutions  of iron (III)
compounds  are yellowish  brown.
Aqueous  solutions  of some iron (II) compounds  are rapidly  oxidized  to the corresponding
iron (IIT) compounds.  For example,  iron (II) hydroxide,  Fe(OH),,  on exposure  to air,
oxidizes  to iron (IIT) hydroxide.

| CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNTT4)
Iron has the ability  to displace  less active  metals  from solutions  of their salts. For example,
when  a piece of iron is placed  in a solution  of CuSO,,  it is oxidized  to Fe** and a reddish
brown  deposit  of copper  metal  forms  on the surface  of the iron.
Fe(s) + Cu’*(aq) > Fe* (aq) + Cu(s)
Uses of Iron
Iron is the most  widely  used metal and takes first position  in worldwide  consumption.  It is
used as a structural  metal in the construction  of buildings  and bridges.  In the form of pig
iron, itis used  to make domestic  boilers,  hot-water  radiators,  railings,  water  pipes, castings,
and mouldings.  As wrought  iron, it is used in making  nails, sheets,  horseshoes,  ornamental
gates, door knockers,  farm machinery  etc. [ron is also used in the manufacture  of alloys
such as carbon  steels and alloy steels. Carbon  steels can be classified  as mild steel, medium
steel and high-carbon  steel, based  on the amount  of carbon.
Mild Steel: contains  up to 0.2%  carbon  and is used in making  screws,  motors,  car batteries,
railway  lines, ships,  bridges,  nuts and bolts.
Medium  Steel: contains  0.3—0.6%  carbon  and is used to make springs  and chains.
High-Carbon  Steel: contains  0.6—1.5%  carbon  and is used to make drill bits, knives,
hammers  and chisels.
Alloy  Steel: contains  iron and a relatively  higher  percentage  of other  metals.  For example,
stainless  steel contains  chromium  (14—18%)  and nickel  (7-9%).  Tool steels include  tungsten
steel and manganese  steel. These  metals  give the alloy hardness,  toughness  and heat
resistance.  They are used in rock drills, cutting  edges and parts of machinery  that are
subjected  to heavy  wear.

Discuss  in your group and give a presentation  to the class.
Occurrence  and extraction
Copper  is occasionally  found  as native  copper.  However,  it is found  mainly  in compounds
such as sulphides,  oxides and the carbonates.  The most important  sulphide  ores are
chalcopyrite  (CuFeS,),  chalcocite  (Cu,S),  covellite  (CuS) and bornite  (Cu.FeS,).  The
principal  oxide ores are cuprite  (Cu,O)  and tenorite  (CuO).  In the carbonate  form, it
exists as malachite  (CuCO,-Cu(OH),).
Copper  is principally  extracted  from chalcopyrite.  Since  the amount  of copper  in the ore is
very small,  the crushed  and ground  sulphide  ore is first concentrated  by froth flotation.  This
treatment  changes  the concentration  of  the ore from  2 % copper  to as high as 30% copper.
The concentrated  ore is then roasted  with a limited  supply  of air (oxygen).
2CuFeS,(s) + 40,(g) — Cu,S(s) + 2FeO(s) + 3S0,(g)
The roasted  mixture  is smelted  by adding  limestone  and sand to form a molten  slag that
removes  many  of the impurities.  FeO present  in the roasted  mixture  can also be removed
as slag in the form  ofiron  silicate  (FeSiO,),  and silica  in the form  of calcium  silicate  (CaSiO,).
CaCO,(s) + SiO,(s) —- CaSiO,  (I) + CO,(g)
FeO (s) + $10,(s) — FeSiO,(1)
The Cu,S obtained  by roasting  chalcopyrite  is then reduced  by heating  it in a limited  supply
of oxygen.
Cu,S (s) + Og) > 2Cu(l) + SO,(g)
The copper  produced  by the above  process  is called  blister  copper  and it has 98.5 — 99.5
% purity.  Blister  copper  contains  iron, silver, gold and sometimes  zinc as impurities.  So it is
refined  further  by electrolysis  as shown  in Figure  4.5. Copper  obtained  by electrolytic
refining  is 99.99%  pure.

Physical  Properties  of Copper
Copper  is a soft, ductile,  malleable,  reddish-brown  metal  with a density  of 8.96 g/cm’.  It
is second  to silver  in electrical  conductivity.  It melts at 1086°C  and boils at 2310°C.
Chemical  properties  of copper
Copper  is less reactive  metal,  that is why it is found  in the native  state.  Although  it is not
very reactive,  it undergoes  the following  reactions:
Powdered  copper,  when  heated  in air forms a black  powder  of copper  (IT) oxide,  CuO.
2Cu(s) + O,(g) — 2CuO(s)
Copper  does not react  with dilute acids like HCI and H,SO.,  It cannot  displace  hydrogen
from acids. However,  it can be oxidized  by oxidizing  acids such as dilute and concentrated
nitric acid and hot concentrated  sulphuric  acid, H,SO.,.

Cu(s) + 2H,SO,(aq) _Hetand  concentrated_,  CySO,  (ag) + 280,(g) + 2H,O (I)
Copper  corrodes  in moist  air over a long period  of time as a result  of oxidation  caused  by
a mixture  of water,  oxygen  and carbon  dioxide.  It turns green, due to the formation  of
verdigris:  a basic copper  carbonate  (CuCO,-Cu(OH),)  or Cu,(OH),CO,,.
2Cu(s) + H,OQG) + O,(g) + CO,(g) — CuCO,-Cu(OH),
Basic copper  carbonate  is responsible  for the green  layer that forms on the surface  of
copper  and bronze  objects.  This layer adheres  to the surface  and protects  the metal from
further  corrosion.
Copper  is a transition  metal and exhibits  different  oxidation  states. It exists as cuprous
(Cu’*) and cupric  (Cu**) ions. Compounds  containing  copper  in the +1 oxidation  state are
stable in insoluble  compounds.  Cu'* is unstable  and cannot  exist in aqueous  solution  since
itreduces  and oxidizes  (disproportionates)  itself  as follows:
2Cu* (aq) — Cu**(aq) + Cu(s)
Soluble  compounds  containing  Cu*, such as CuCl, Cul and CuBr, are all colourless  solids.
The most stable oxidation  state of copper  is +2. Aqueous  solutions  of many copper  (ID)
compounds  are blue, thus copper  forms coloured  compounds  in the oxidation  state of +2.
For example,  hydrated  copper  sulphate,  CuSO,-5H,O,  consists  of blue crystals,  and its
aqueous  solution  is also blue.

Uses of Copper
Copper  is used to manufacture  alloys.  For example,  bronze  is an alloy of copper  and tin,
and it is used to make coins, medals,  bells, machinery  parts, etc. Brass is an alloy of
copper  and zinc, and it is used for hardware  tops, terminals  and pipes. Copper  is widely
used in the electrical  industry  in the form of electric  wires,  cables  etc. Copper  compounds,
such as copper  chloride,  copper  carbonate  and copper  hydroxide,  are used as pesticides.

does nitrogen  form triple bond?
2. Which form of nitrogen  is absorbed  by green plants?
Discuss  in group and give a presentation  to the class.
Occurrence  and Production
Nitrogen  occurs  in nature  in the elemental  form. It also exists in the form  of compounds.  In
the elemental  state, it exists as a diatomic  molecule,  N,, in atmospheric  air. It constitutes
about  80% by volume  of the atmosphere.  In the form of compounds,  it exists as sodium
nitrate  (Chile  salt  peter,  NaNO,)  and potassium  nitrate  (KNO,)  also called  saltpetre.  It is
also found  in DNA  molecules  and proteins  of all living  things.
In the industrial  production  of nitrogen,  the first step is to remove  impurities  like dust and
other  particles  from air. The air is then compressed  under  high pressure  and low temperature
to remove  carbon  dioxide  and water vapour  since they solidify  at a relatively  high
| CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT4)
temperatures  compared  to nitrogen  and oxygen.  As the temperature  continues  to decrease,
the air containing  mainly  nitrogen  and oxygen  condenses  to give a pale-blue  liquid.  Nitrogen
is thus separated  on an industrial  scale by fractional  distillation  of liquid  air. When  liquid  air
is fractionally  distilled,  nitrogen  is collected  and stored  in steel cylinders  under  pressure.
The second  fraction  consists  of argon,  which  distils  off  the mixture  at —186°C,  leaving
behind  a blue liquid  of oxygen  that boils at—183°C.
In the laboratory,  nitrogen  is prepared  by warming  an aqueous  solution  containing  ammonium
chloride  and sodium  nitrite.
NH,Cl  (aq) + NaNO,(aq)  — NaCl(aq) + N,(g) + 2H,O (1)
Physical  Properties  of Nitrogen
Nitrogen  is colourless,  odourless  and tasteless  gas. It is inert  under  ordinary  conditions,  and
that is why it is found  in atmospheric  air as N,. The inertness  of  nitrogen  at low temperatures
is directly  related  to the strength  of  the triple bond,  which  requires  high energy  to break.
Chemical  Properties  of Nitrogen
Is nitrogen  a reactive  or unreactive  non-metal?  Can you suggest  a prooffor your
answer?
However,  nitrogen  reacts  with metals  of group  IA and ITA as well as oxygen  at higher
temperatures.  When  heated  with reactive  metals  like lithium,  calcium  and magnesium,  it
forms compounds,  known  as nitrides.

Nitrogen  also forms  oxides,  like dinitrogen  monoxide,  N,O, (commonly  called  laughing
gas), dinitrogen  trioxide  (N,O,)  and dinitrogen  pentoxide  (N,O,).
Nitrogen  reacts directly  with hydrogen  in the Haber  process  to form ammonia.  In this
process,  a mixture  of N, and H, gas, at a pressure  of 200-300  atm and a temperature  of
400-600°C,  is passed  over a catalyst  of finely  divided  iron.

Uses of Nitrogen
Nitrogen  is used in food packaging  to prevent  oxidation,  and to create  an inert atmosphere
in the production  of semiconductors.  Liquid  nitrogen  is used as arefrigerant  to preserve
bulls’ semen  and blood.  Its major  use is in the production  of ammonia.

B. Phosphorus
Occurrence  and Extraction
Does  phosphorus  exist in the pure  form (elemental  state) as does nitrogen?  If not,
why? Phosphorus  is a relatively  abundant  element,  ranking  12th in the earth’s  crust. It
exists naturally  only in the combined  state, such as in rock phosphate,  Ca,(PO,).,
fluoroapatite,  Ca,,(PO,).F,  or 3Ca,(PO,),.CaF,.  It is also found in teeth, bones and
DNA.
What is allotropy?  What are the two common  allotropes  ofphosphorus?
Allotropes  are different  forms  of the same element  with the same physical  state but with
different  physical  properties.  This is due to the difference  in the arrangement  of atoms.
The two common  allotropic  forms  of phosphorus  are white  phosphorus  and red phosphorus.
White  phosphorus  1s a very poisonous,  white  waxy-looking  substance  that melts at 44.1°C
and boils at 287°C. Its density  is 1.8 g/cm’. It consists  of individual  tetra-atomic  (P,)
molecules  and is an unstable  form of phosphorus.
| CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT4)
Red phosphorus  is denser  (2.16 g/cm*)  and is much  less reactive  than white  phosphorus  at
normal  temperatures.  It consists  of P, molecules  linked  together  to form a polymer  (/arge
molecule)  as shown  below.

White phosphorus Red chosphorus
Industrially,  white phosphorus  is manufactured  by heating  a mixture  of crushed  rock
phosphate,  Ca,(PO,),,  silica, SiO,, and coke in an electric  furnace.  The reaction  in the
furnace  is:
2Ca,(PO,),(s)  + 6SiO,(s) + 10C(s) + 6CaSiO,(I)  + P,(g) + 10CO(g)
The vaporized  phosphorus  (P.,) is condensed,  collected  and stored  under  water. Red
phosphorus  1s prepared  by heating  white  phosphorus  in sunlight  for several  days. White
phosphorus  is stored  under  water  because  it spontaneously  ignites  (bursts  into flames)  in
the presence  of oxygen.  Red phosphorus  is much  less reactive  than white  phosphorus  and
does not need to be stored  under  water.

Oxygen  is the most abundant  element  on earth. It constitutes  about  46.6%  by weight  of  the
earth’s  crust in the form of compounds  such as oxides,  silicates,  carbonates,  phosphates
etc. It exists in nature  in the elemental  state in atmospheric  air constituting  about  20% by
volume.  Oxygen  is manufactured  industrially  by the fractional  distillation  of liquid  air ina
way similar  to that of nitrogen.
Chemical  Properties  of Oxygen
Oxygen  is relatively  reactive  and combines  directly  with most elements  to form oxides.
Oxygen  combines  with metal  to form  metal  oxides  (basic  oxides).  For example,
2Mg(s) + O,(g) 7 2MgO(s)
2Ca(s) + O,(8) — ~ 2CaO (s)
Oxygen  combines  with non-metals  to form acidic  oxides;  for example:
S. (Ss) + 80,(g) > 8SO,(g)
P,(s) + = SO, (8) > — PAOj, (8)
Oxygen  supports  combustion  and is necessary  for the burning  of substances  like charcoal,
hydrocarbon  fuel, etc.

D. Sulphur
Occurrence  and Extraction
Sulphur  is found  in nature  and in the form of compounds  such as galena  (PbS),  pyrites
(FeS,) (fool's  gold  ), cinnabar  (HgS),  sphalerite  (ZnS),  gypsum  (CaSO,-2H,O),  barite
(BaSO,),  and as hydrogen  sulphide  (H,S) in natural  gas and crude oil.
Sulphur  is extracted  from  underground  deposits  of elemental  sulphur  by the Frasch  process
(Figure  4.6). In this process,  three concentric  pipes are sent down  to the sulphur  deposit.
Superheated  water at about 170°C is pumped  through  the outermost  pipes. Hot air is
compressed  in the innermost  tube. A froth of sulphur,  air and water  come out to the surface
of the earth forced  by hot compressed  air in the middle  tube. The molten  sulphur  is then
cooled  and solidified.

Uses:  Nearly  one-half  of  the sulphur  needed  by chemical  industries  is obtained  as a waste
product  of other  industrial  processes.  For example,  sulphur  can be obtained  in the form of
hydrogen  sulphide  (HS) from natural  gas and during  the purification  of crude  oil. It can
also be obtained  in the form of sulphur  dioxide  from  the roasting  of sulphide  ores during  the
manufacture  of metals.  The use of sulphur  obtained  from  waste  products  of other industries
reduces  the demand  for the element  from natural  deposits.  This also reduces  the pollution
of atmospheric  air and the formation  of acid rain.
Sulphur  exhibits  allotropy.  The most important  allotropes  of sulphur  are rhombic  and
monoclinic  sulphur.  Rhombic  sulphur  is the most stable  form of sulphur  consisting  of S,
molecules.
Chemical  Properties  of Sulphur
Sulphur  is relatively  stable and unreactive  at room  temperature.  However,  it reacts  with
metals  and non-metals  when  heated.
Sulphur  combines  with metals  when  heated  to form sulphides.
8Fe (s) + S.(s) > 8FeS (s)
Sulphur  burns in oxygen  to form oxides.

Sulphur  is the raw material  for the production  of sulphuric  acid (H,SO,)  by the Contact
Process.  This process  of sulphuric  acid production  involves  the following  steps.
Step 1: Sulphur  is first oxidized  to produce  sulphur  dioxide:
Sg(s) + 80,(g) — _ 8SO, (g)
Step 2: Sulphur  dioxide  is converted  to sulphur  trioxide  at high  temperatures  in the presence
ofacatalyst:
V,O2S0,(g) + O, —+ => 2S0,(g)
Step 3: Sulphur  trioxide  is absorbed  into concentrated  sulphuric  acid to produce  oleum
(H,S,O.).
SO,(2) + 4H,S0,(l) > H,S,0,()
Step 4: The oleum  is then diluted  with water  to produce  the desired  concentration  of
sulphuric  acid. Commercially  used concentrated  sulphuric  acid is 98% H,SO.,.

and turns normal  after a few minutes.  Many  people  say that the white  colour  we see is due
to chlorine.  Do you agree?  Discuss  in group  and present  your opinion  to the class.
2. What is the purpose  of adding chlorine  to drinking  water?
Occurrence  and Extraction
Chlorine  belongs  to group  VIIA,  known  as the halogens.  It is the most abundant  element
among  the halogens.  It is found  in nature  in the form of compounds  only. Chlorine  is found
in nature  chiefly  in the form of chlorides  of sodium,  potassium,  calcium  and magnesium.
Sodium  chloride  is the chief  source  of chlorine,  and it is obtained  from seawater  or as
deposits  of rock salt.
Commercially,  chlorine  is manufactured  by the electrolysis  ofa concentrated  aqueous  solution
of sodium  chloride.  During  electrolysis  of the concentrated  solution,  chlorine  is formed  at
the anode and the reduction  of water  occurs  at the cathode,  producing  hydrogen  gas and
hydroxide  ions (OH). The electrode  and the overall  cell reactions  are as follows:
Oxidation  at anode: = 2CI (aq) — Cl, (g) + 2e°
Reduction  at cathode:  2H,O (1) + 2e° — H, (g) + 2OH (aq)
Cell reaction: 2NaCl (aq) + 2H,O (1) — 2NaOH  (aq) + CL, (g) + H, (g)
Although  NaOH  forms  at the cathode  compartment  and C1, at the anode,  the two substances
must  be kept apart  from one another.  This is because,  ifthey  come into contact  with each
other,  they can react according  to the following  equation.
NaOH  (aq) + CL(g) — NaOCl(aq)  + HCI (aq)

¢ [tis extremely  poisonous,  causing  inflammation  of  the lungs and mucous  membranes
if inhaled,  even in very small amounts.  It is fatal ifinhaled  in higher  amounts.
Chemical  Properties  of Chlorine
Chlorine  is ahighly  reactive  non-metal.  It reacts directly  with almost  all elements  except
the noble  gases,  carbon  and nitrogen.  It is a powerful  oxidizing  agent  and oxidizes  most  of
the elements  with which  it reacts.  The following  are the main  reactions  of chlorine.

elemental  chlorine  or as chlorine  water,  it is strong  enough  to oxidize  dyes and to bleach
coloured  materials.  For example,  it can be used  to remove  yellow  or brown  colours  from
wood  pulp, paper  and cotton.

PROJECT  4.2
1. Have you ever wondered  how glass retains different  colours?  Consult  books
in your library and make list of the compounds  added to impart colour  to the
glass.
2. Can glass be recycled;  how?
Submit  your findings  to your teacher.
Glass
Glass is an amorphous  or non-crystalline  solid material.  Almost  all glass contains  silica  as
the main component.  Quartz  glass is made  by melting  pure silica, SiO, at a temperature  of
about  2300°C  and then pouring  the molten  viscous  liquid  into moulds.  It is of high strength,
low thermal  expansion  and highly  transparent.
Soda-lime  glass is ordinary  glass which  is amixture  of sodium  silicate  and calcium  silicate.
Itis made  by heating  a mixture  of silica  sand, sodium  carbonate  or sodium  sulphate  and
limestone.  The reactions  that take place in forming  soda-lime  glass are the following:
Na,cO, + SiO, — NaSiO, + CO,
CaCO, + SiO, > CaSiO, + CO,
Soda-lime  glass accounts  for about  90% of manufactured  glass. This type of glass is widely
used for window  panes,  bottles,  dishes  etc.
Borosilicate  glass is commonly  known  as Pyrex.  It is manufactured  using  boron  (III)
oxide,  B,O,, instead  of limestone  or calcium  oxide.  This glass has high  resistance  to chemical
corrosion  and temperature  changes  and is widely  used to make ovenware  and laboratory
equipment  such as flasks,  beakers,  and test tubes.
Steps in glass  production
i) Batch  preparation:  refers  to the preparation  of the raw materials  according  to the
appropriate  combinations.  The raw materials  are mixed  in a proportion  of 60%
sand, 21% sodium  carbonate  and 19% limestone.
ii) Glass  melting:  The raw materials  and recycled  glass (according  to their colour)
are fed into a glass-melting  furnace.  The materials  are then heated  to a temperature
of about 1600°C  to form a molten  viscous  liquid.  Why are glasses  is separated
according  to the colour?
The furnace  operates  continuously,  producing  glass 24 hours a day. Substances  that
give the glass different  colours  or improved  chemical  and physical  properties  such
as transparency,  thermal  and chemical  stability  and mechanical  strength  are added
during  this process.
__ CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
iii) Glass  forming:  This is the stage in which  the melted  glass is made into a required
shape.
iv) Annealing:  This is a process  that involves  the removal  of internal  stresses  by reheating
the glass followed  by a controlled  slow-cooling  cycle during  which  the stresses  are
relieved.
v) Inspection:  It involves  testing  of  the glass product  to check  whether  it fulfils desired
quality  requirements  or not.
vi) Packing  and dispatching  is the final stage before  distribution.
Ceramics
Activity  4.16
1. Are you familiar  with the pottery industry?  Do you know any ceramic factories  in
Ethiopia?
3. Prepare  a list of ceramic  products  used in daily life.
Discuss  in groups  and give presentation  to the class.
Ceramic  is an inorganic,  non-metallic  solid prepared  by the action  of heat and subsequent
cooling.  Traditional  ceramics,  such as porcelain,  tiles and pottery  are formed  from  minerals
such as clay, talc and feldspar.  Most industrial  ceramics,  however,  are formed  from
extremely  pure powders  of specialty  chemicals,  such as silicon  carbide,  alumina,  barium
titanate,  and titanium  carbide.
Manufacturing  of ceramics
The minerals  used to make ceramics  are dug out of the earth and are then crushed  and
ground  into a fine powder.  Manufacturers  often  purify  this powder  by mixing  it ina solution
and allowing  a chemical  precipitate  (a uniform  solid  thatforms  within  a solution)  to
form. The precipitate  is then separated  from  the solution.  The powder  is heated  to drive off
impurities  including  water.
The processes  of manufacturing  ceramics  include:
A Moulding:  After  purification,  small amounts  ofwax are often  added  to bind  the ceramic
powder  and make it more workable.  Plastics  may also be added  to the powder  to
give the desired  pliability  and softness.  The powder  can then be shaped  into different
objects  by various  moulding  processes.
B_ Densification:  The process  of densification  uses intense  heat to condense  a ceramic
object  into astrong,  dense product.  After being  moulded,  the ceramic  object  is
heated  in an electric  furnace  to temperatures  between  1000°C  and 1700°C.  As the
@ chemistrycrave1o
ceramic  heats,  the powder  particles  coalesce,  much  as water  droplets  join at room
temperature.  As the ceramic  particles  merge,  the object  becomes  increasingly  dense,
shrinking  by up to 20 percent  of its original  size. The goal of this heating  process  is
to maximize  the strength  of ceramic  by obtaining  an internal  structure  that is compact
and extremely  dense.
In general,  most ceramics  are hard and wear-resistant,  brittle,  refractory,  thermal  and
electrical  insulators,  non-magnetic,  oxidation-resistant,  and chemically  stable.
Due to the wide range of properties  of ceramic  materials,  they are used for a multitude  of
applications.
¢ Well-known  uses of ceramics:  They are commonly  found  in art sculptures,  dishes,
platters  and other  kitchenware,  kitchen  tiles and bath room structures.
e Lesser-known  uses for ceramics:  They are used as electrical  insulators,
computers  parts,  tools, dental  replacements,  engine  parts, and tiles on space shuttles
and to replace  bones such as the bones in hips, knees and shoulders.
¢ Future  uses of ceramics:  In future,  the ceramics  might  be used  to remove  impurities
from  the drinking  water,  and to replace  diseased  heart  valves.
Cement
Activity  4.17
1. How many cement  factories  do you know in Ethiopia?  Name the regions  where they
are found and share these with your classmates.
2. Why are cement  factories  located in rural areas of Ethiopia?  Give your reasons  to the
class.
Cement  is made  by heating  limestone  (chalk),  alumina  (AI,O,)  and silica-bearing  materials
such as clay to 1450°C  in akiln  using  a process  known  as calcination.  The resulting  hard
substance  called  ‘clinker’  is then ground  with a small amount  of gypsum  into a powder  to
make “ordinary  Portland  cement”  (OPC).
Cement  mainly  consists  of calcium  silicate  (CaSiO,),  calcium  aluminate  (CaALO,), tron
(III) oxide (Fe,O,)  and magnesium  oxide (MgO).
Portland  cement  is a very important  building  material,  and was first discovered  in England.
It received  its name  because,  on setting,  it hardens  to a stone-like  mass and was compared
to the famous  Portland  Rock  of  England.  It is amixture  of calcium  and aluminium  silicates
with gypsum.
Raw Materials:  Limestone  and clay are the chief raw materials  used in the
manufacture  of Portland  cement.
_ CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
Manufacturing  Process:  First, limestone  and clay are crushed  separately.  They are
then mixed in the required  quantities  and finally mixed and ground  together,  which can
be done either by the dry or wet process.  The wet process  is suitable  if the limestone
and clay are soft. If the raw materials  are hard, the dry process  is preferred.  The dry
process  is cost-effective  because  fuel consumption  is less when the raw materials  are
burnt in a rotary kiln.

is due to the formation  of three-dimensional  cross-links  between  -—Si-O-St-  and —Si-O-—
Al- chains.
The first setting  occurs  within  24 hours,  whereas,  the subsequent  hardening  requires  about
two weeks.  In the hardening  process  of cement,  the transition  from plastic  to solid state 1s
called  setting.

Sugar Manufacturing
Activity  4.18
1. Prepare  a list of foods and drinks used at your home in which sugar is an ingredient.
2. Is sugar made only from sugar cane? If no, what are the other sources? Discuss in
group and give a presentation  to the class.
"CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT4)
Sugarcane  is a perennial  herb belonging  to the grass family.  Native  to tropical  and subtropical
regions  of the world,  this tropical  grass is about  3 metres  tall.
Planting:  Sugarcane  is planted  in fields by workers  or mechanical  planters.  Typical  cane
soil is made from the mixture  of silts, clay particles  and organic  matter.  Fertilizers  are
applied  from  the time of  planting  up until the beginning  of  the ripening  period,  depending  on
the region  where  the crop is planted.  Cane seasons  last from 8-22 months.
1.Collecting  the Harvest:  Mature  canes are gathered  by a combination  of manual
and mechanical  methods.  The cane is cut at ground  level,  the leaves  are removed,
the top is trimmed  off  (by cutting  offthe last maturejoint)  the canes and transported
to a sugar  factory.
Cleansing  and Grinding:  The stalks are thoroughly  washed  and cut at the sugar
mill. After  the cleaning  process,  amachine  led by a series  of rotating  knives,  shreds
the cane into pieces.  This is known  as “grinding”.  During  grinding,  hot water  is
sprayed  onto the sugarcane  to dissolve  the remaining  hard sugar. The shredded
cane is then spread  out on a conveyer  belt.
Juicing:  The shredded  sugarcane  travels  on the conveyor  belt through  a series of
heavy-duty  rollers,  which  extractjuice  from  the pulp. The pulp  that remains,  or “bagasse  ”’
is dried and used as a fuel. The raw  juice moves  on through  the mill to be clarified.
Clarifying:  Carbon  dioxide  and milk of lime are added  to the liquid  sugar  mixture,
which  is heated  until boiling.  The process  of clarifying  begins  at this stage.  As the
carbon  dioxide  moves  through  the liquid,  it forms calcium  carbonate,  which  attracts
non-sugar  debris  (fats, gums and waxes)  from the juice, and pulls them away from
the sugar  juice. The juice is then pushed  through a series of filters  to remove  any
remaining  impurities.
Evaporation:  The clear  juice that results  from the clarifying  process  is put under  a
vacuum,  where  the juice boils at a low temperature  and the water  in it begins  to
evaporate.  It is heated  until it forms into thick,  brown  syrup.
Crystallization:  Crystallization  is the process  of evaporating  the water  from the
sugar syrup. Pulverized  sugar is fed into a sterilized  vacuum  pan. As the liquid
evaporates,  crystals  form. The remaining  mixture  is a thick  mass of large crystals.
These  crystals  are sent to a centrifuge  that spins and dries them. The dried product
is raw sugar,  which  is edible.
Refinery:  Raw sugar is transported  to a cane sugar  refinery  for the removal  of
molasses,  minerals  and other  non-sugars  that contaminate  it. This is known  as the
purification  process.  Raw sugar  is mixed  with a solution  of sugar  and water  to loosen
the molasses  from the outside  of the raw sugar crystals,  producing  a thick  matter
known  as “magma”.  Large  machines  then spin the magma,  separating  the molasses
from  the crystals.  The crystals  are promptly  washed,  dissolved  and filtered  to remove
impurities.  The golden  syrup  that is produced  is then sent through  filters,  and SO, is
mux?
passed  through  it to remove  the colour  and water.  The process  of removing  colour
is known  as bleaching. What is left is concentrated,  clear syrup  which  is again  fed
into a vacuum  pan for evaporation.
8. Separation  and packaging:  Once  the final evaporation  and drying  process  is done,
screens  separate  the different-sized  sugar  crystals.  Large and small crystals  are
packaged  and labelled  as white  refined  sugar.

Paper and Pulp
Activity  4.19
Discuss  the following  issues in the group and give a presentation  to your class:
1.
2.Wasting  paper is like chopping  down trees. Comment.
Some papers are relatively  cheap. The paper used for this grade 10 text book, for
example,  is expensive.  Are different  types of paper manufactured  by different
processes?
Wood  is the raw material  for making  wood  pulp and paper. Wood  pulp is a dry fibrous
material  used for making  paper. The timber  resources  used  to make  wood  pulp are referred
to as pulp wood.  Wood  pulp is made from soft-wood  trees, such as spruce,  pine, fir, larch
and hemlock,  and from hard woods,  such as eucalyptus,  aspen  and birch.
Wood  is composed  of cellulose,  lignin,  oils and resins.  Lignin  is used to bind fibres of
cellulose  together.  To provide  wood  pulp, the cellulose  must  be separated  from  the lignin.
Manufacturing  ofpulp and  paper  involves  the following  steps:
1.Harvesting  trees involves  the cutting  down  of trees from their growing  areas and
transporting  the timber  to the paper  and pulp industry.
Preparation  for pulping  is astep  in which  the bark of  the tree is removed  and then
the wood  is chipped  and screened  to provide  uniform  sized chips (pieces).
Pulping  is astep  used to make  wood  pulp from the chipped  wood  pieces.  This can
be accomplished  by either  mechanical  or chemical  means  depending  on the strength
and grade of paper  to be manufactured.
aMechanical  pulping:  It utilizes  steam,  pressure  and high  temperatures  instead
of chemicals  to tear the fibres. The fibre quality  is greatly  reduced  because
mechanical  pulping  creates  short,  weak  fibres  that still contain  the lignin  that bonds
the fibres together.  Paper used for newspapers  are a typical product  of
mechanical  pulping.
Chemical  pulping:  Chemical  pulp is produced  by combining  wood  chips and
chemicals  in large vessels  called  digesters.  Heat and the chemicals  break  down
the lignin  which  binds  the cellulose  fibres  together  without  seriously  degrading
the cellulose  fibres. Chemical  pulp is manufactured  using  the Kraft  process  or
the Sulphite  Process.
i) The Kraft  Process  is the dominant  chemical  pulping  method.  It is the most
widely  used method  for making  pulp from all types of trees. The process  uses
@—  cemistaycrapeno
aqueous  sodium  hydroxide  and sodium  sulphide  as a digestion  solution.  After
digestion  for about  four hours at a temperature  of 170°C,  the pulp is separated
by filtration.  This process  uses a basic digestion  medium.
ii) The Sulphite  Process  uses a cooking  liquor  (digestion)  solution  of sodium
bisulphate  or magnesium  bisulphate  digester  at pH of about 3 ina pulp.
The action  of the hydrogen  sulphide  ions at 60°C over 6 to 12 hours dissolves
the lignin  and separates  it from the cellulose.  After  the process  is complete,
the pulp is recovered  by filtration.
The wood  pulp achieved  from  the Sulphite  or Kraft  processes  is washed  to
remove  chemicals  and passed  through  a series of screens  to remove  foreign
materials.
4. Bleaching:  It is the process  of removing  colouring  matter  from wood  pulp and
increasing  its brightness.  The most common  bleaching  agents  are strong  oxidizing
agents  such as chlorine,  chlorine  oxide,  ozone  and hydrogen  peroxide.
5. Making  paper  from pulp: After  bleaching,  the pulp is processed  into liquid  stock
that can be transferred  to a paper  mill. The suspension  is poured  onto a continuously
moving  screen  belt and the liquor  is allowed  to seep away by gravity  to produce
paper  sheet. The continuous  sheet  then moves  through  additional  rollers  that compress
the fibres and remove  the residual  water  to produce  fine paper.

1. The leather products  of Ethiopia are durable and relatively  cheaper  than the same
products  imported  from outside.  Why do people prefer to buy imported  products?
What can you suggest  to change  this attitude?  Discuss  this matter in class in relation  to
quality  and availability  of resources.
2. Why are leather  products  being replaced  by synthetic  products?
Discuss  in groups  and present  to the class.
Tanning  is a process  of converting  raw animal  hides and skin to leather,  using  tannin.  Leather
is a durable  and flexible  material  created  by the tanning  of animal  hides and skin. Tannin  is
an acidic  chemical  that permanently  alters the protein  structure  ofa skin so that it can never
return  to rawhide  or skin again.
Leather  production  involves  various  preparatory  stages,  tanning,  and crusting
1. Preparatory  stages  are those in which  the hide or skin is prepared  for tanning.
This stage includes  curing,  soaking,  flesh removal,  hair removal,  scudding,  and
deliming.
| CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION  (UNTT4)
Curing:  This process  involves  salting  or drying  the hide once it has been  removed
from the animal.  Curing  is employed  to prevent  putrefaction  of the protein
substance,  collagen,  from  bacterial  infection.  Curing  also removes  excess  water
from  the hide and skin. Brine curing  is the simplest  and fastest  method.
Soaking:  In this process,  cured  hides are soaked  in water  for several  hours  to
several  days to remove  salt, dirt, debris,  blood  and excess  animal  fat from the
skin.
Flesh removal:  In this process,  animal  hides are moved  through  a machine
that strips the flesh from  the surface  of the hide.
Hair removal:  In this step, the soaked  hides and skins are transported  to large
vats where  they are immersed  in a mixture  of lime and water. This process  is
called  liming.  It loosens  the hair from the skin and makes  hair-removal  easier.
After 1-10 days soaking,  the hair is mechanically  removed  from the hide by a
hair-removing  machine.
Scudding:  This is the process  in which  hair and fat missed  by the machines  are
removed  from  the hide with  a plastic  tool or dull knife.
Deliming:  This process  involves  the removal  of lime from  the skin or hide in a
vat of acid. After  this preparatory  process,  the skin or hide is ready  for tanning.
2. Tanning  is a process  that converts  the protein  of the raw hide or skin into a stable
material.  There  are two main  types of tanning:
aVegetable  or natural  tanning:  The skin is placed  in a solution  of  tannin.  Tannins
occur  naturally  in the barks and leaves  of many  plants.  The primary  barks  used in
modern  times are chestnut,  oak, tanoak,  hemlock,  quebracho,  mangrove,
wattle  (acacia)  and myrobalan.  Naturally  tanned  hide is flexible  and is used
for making  shoes,  luggage  and furniture.
Mineral  tanning:  In this process,  the skin is placed  in solutions  of chemicals
such as chromium  sulphate  and other salts of chromium.  Chrome  tanning  1s faster
than natural  (vegetable)  tanning  and requires  only twenty  four hours.  The leather
is greenish-blue  in colour  derived  from the chromium.  This process  produces
stretchable  leather  that is used for making  garments  and handbags.
3. Crusting:  This is the final stage in leather  manufacturing  and includes  dyeing,  rolling
the leather  to make it strong,  stretching  it in a heat-controlled  room and performing
aprocess  that involves  covering  the grain  surface  with chemical  compounds  such as
wax, oil, glazes  etc. to make  the leather  very attractive.

Food Processing  and Preservation
Activity  4.21
1. The rate of spoilage  of food is faster in open air in comparison  to foods kept inside the
refrigerator.  Explain.  Discuss  in group and present  your findings  to the class.
Food  preservation  is the process  of treating  and handling  food to stop or greatly  reduce
spoilage,  loss of quality,  edibility  or nutritive  value caused  or accelerated  by micro-
organisms.
Preservation  usually  involves  preventing  the growth  of bacteria,  fungi and other  micro-
organisms,  as well as reducing  the oxidation  of fats, which  causes  rancidity.
Activity  4.22
1. What are the traditional  methods  used to preserve  food for a long time without
spoilage  at your home?
2. What modern  methods  of food preserving  and processing  do we use in Ethiopia?
Discuss  in groups  and give a presentation  to the class.
Modern  methods  offood  preservation  are:
a Freezing:  This is one of the most commonly  used processes,  commercially  and
domestically,  for preserving  a very wide range  of foods  such as potatoes,  as well as
prepared  foodstuffs  that would  not require  freezing  in their normal  state.
b Freeze-drying:  Water  vapour  has easier  access  through  the cell structure  of any
product  compared  to water-penetrating  the product  and evaporating  from  the surface
of the product  as is the case of other drying  methods.  The gentle  escape  of water
vapour  in the freeze-drying  process  leaves  the product  close to its original  shape,
taste, and colour  and there is no loss of aroma  or flavour.
For example,  liquids  such as coffee,  tea, juices and other extracts,  vegetables,
segments  of fish and meat  products.  Freeze-drying  is a superior  preservation  method
for a variety  of food products  and food ingredients.
¢ Vacuum-packing:  Stores  food ina vacuum  environment,  usually  in an air-tight  bag
or bottle.  The vacuum  environment  strips  bacteria  of  the oxygen  needed  for survival,
slowing  down  the rate of spoiling.  Vacuum-packing  is commonly  used for storing
nuts to reduce  loss of flavour  from oxidation.

@ ciemistrycrave10
Pollution  is any discharge  ofa solid, liquid  or gaseous  substance  or radiation  (energy)  into
an environment  that causes  unwanted  changes.  Pollution  causes  short-term  or long-term
harm that affects  the earth’s  ecological  balance  and lowers  the quality  of life in the
environment.  A pollutant  is any substance  that changes  air, water  or any other  natural
resource  in a way that impairs  the use of the resource.
Pollutants  are discharged  into the environment  as a result  of natural  events  (like a volcanic
eruption)  and as aresult  of human  activities  (such  as the operation  of chemical  industries,
agriculture,  etc.). Pollutants  can be classified  by the type of  pollution  they cause: air pollution,
water  pollution,  and land pollution.
Air Pollution
Activity  4.24
1. Based on the situation  of your locality,  discuss the following  issues in groups and
present  the findings  to the class:
a_ List some human  activities  which contribute  to air pollution.
b How these activities  contribute  to air pollution?
c What solutions  do you recommend  to overcome  these problems?
d What could be your contribution  to reduce  air pollutions?
2. Give your suggestions  on the statement,  ‘Air pollution  any where is a potential  threat
elsewhere.’
Air pollution  is caused  by the presence  of contaminant  gaseous  substances  in the air that
affect  the lives of plants and animals  on earth. Some common  air pollutants  are sulphur
dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides, carbon monoxide,  ozone, hydrocarbons,  particulates,
chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs),  and lead compounds.
Sulphur  dioxide  (SO,):  This enters  the atmospheric  air from  the combustion  of coal and
petroleum,  and during  extraction  of metals  from their sulphide  ores. It causes  coughing,
chest  pains and shortness  of breath. It is thought  to be a cause for bronchitis  and lung
diseases.  It slowly  oxidizes  to SO, by reacting  with the oxygen  in the air.
Oxides  of nitrogen:  These  can be formed  in the atmosphere  by natural  processes  like
thunderstorms.  Combustion  of fossil fuel containing  nitrogen  compounds  as impurities  and
exhaust  gases from furnaces  and engines  increase  the amount  of nitric oxide,  NO, and
nitrogen  dioxide,  NO,, in the atmosphere.  Nitric  oxide,  NO, catalyzes  the decomposition
of ozone  in the upper  layer  of the atmosphere  to oxygen,  thus decreasing  the ozone  layer.
20, (g) 2 > 30,(g)
Nitric  oxide is oxidized  by oxygen  to nitrogen  dioxide  in the presence  of ultraviolet  light.
2NO(g) + O,(g) — 2NO,(g)
SO,, SO, and NO, react  with rainwater  and form sulphurous  acid (H,SO,),  sulphuric
acid (H,SO,)  and nitric acid (HNO,),  respectively  and cause acid rain. Acid  rain accelerates
corrosion  and the deterioration  of metals,  buildings,  statues  and also causes  tree defoliation,
release  of heavy  metal ions from soil into water  courses  and drop in the pH of water  in
rivers and lakes.
Hydrocarbons  and ozone  are responsible  for photochemical  smog.  It is characterized  by
a reddish-brown  haze containing  substances  irritating  to the eye, nose, and lungs, and
causes  extensive  damage  to vegetation.  Considerable  amounts  of  hydrocarbons  are released
into the atmosphere  by the evaporation  of gasoline  as unburnt  hydrocarbons  in auto exhaust.
These substances  react  with ozone  to give compounds  that contribute  to the oxidizing
nature  of photochemical  smog.
Carbon  monoxide:  Most  of the carbon  monoxide  escapes  into the atmosphere  due to
the incomplete  combustion  of fuel. Prolonged  exposure  to carbon  monoxide  impairs  vision,
produces  headaches,  and exerts strain  on the heart. It also reduces  the oxygen-carrying
capacity  of the blood  by reacting  with haemoglobin.
Particulates:  Dust storms,  forest  fires, volcanic  eruptions  and human  activities  such as
mining  and burning  coal and oil increase  the amount  of solid particles  in the air. Industrial
areas contain  particles  of limestone,  fertilizers,  coal, stones,  cement  and silica. These
particulates  irritate  the lungs and deleteriously  affect  breathing.
Chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs):  Chlorofluorocarbons  are used as refrigerants,  solvents
and plastic  foam-blowing  agents.  When  entering  the atmosphere,  they penetrate  into the
upper  layers  and interact  with ultraviolet  radiation  as follows.
crcl, “> crc + cl
The free chlorine,  Cl, reacts  with ozone  to form chlorine  monoxide  and oxygen.
Cl + O, ~ ClO} + O,
These  reactions  result  in the conversion  of ozone  to molecular  oxygen  and contribute  to
depletion  of the ozone  layer. This situation  in the upper  atmosphere  allows  dangerous
ultravioletradiation to reach  the earth’s  surface.  This radiation  causes  skin cancer  in human  beings.
Excess  carbon  dioxide:  The combustion  of coal and petroleum  to generate  electricity,
move  our vehicles,  heat our homes  and supply  power  to our industrial  machinery  causes  a
significant  increase  in the concentration  of carbon  dioxide  in the atmosphere.  Combustion
of these fuels releases  about 20 billion  tonnes of CO, annually.  The increase  in the
concentration  of CO, in the atmosphere  has resulted  in a rise in the average  global
temperature,  owing  to the greenhouse  effect. Carbon  dioxide  and water  vapour  absorb
infrared  radiation,  re-radiated  from  the earth, behaving  like the glass in a green  house.
Since CO, and water  vapour  absorb  heat they are called  green-house  gases. Due to the
227
@&— cHemistryeraveto
absorption  of heat by the green  house  gases in the atmosphere,  the overall  effect  is global
warming  (an increase  in the average  temperature  of our planet).  This rise in global
temperature  causes  melting  of polar ice and thus additional  water  flowing  into the oceans.
This situation,  in turn, results  in the rising  of the levels of seas and oceans,  flooding  of
coastlines  and lowland  areas,  which  can submerge  these areas.
Heavy  metals:  Lead contamination  in the atmosphere  is a result  of vehicle  engines  that
use fuels containing  tetraethyl  lead which  is added  to the fuel to reduce  engine  knocking.
The use of lead paints  also contributes  towards  lead contamination.  High levels of lead
cause damage  to the brain,  kidneys  and liver.

_ CHEMISTRY  IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
Water  pollution  is the degradation  of the quality  of water  brought  about  by the discharge
into it of untreated  sewage,  industrial  and agricultural  waste,  and oil spillage.  In general,
water  is said to be polluted  if it contains  matter  that affects  the health  of living  things  or
causes  damage  to property.  The major  water  pollutants  are nitrate  and phosphate  fertilisers
washed  out of  the soil, phosphate  detergents,  untreated  sewage,  insecticides  and herbicides,
and the heavy  metal ion, acidic  and/or  basic residues  released  by industrial  processes.
Phosphate  and nitrate  fertilisers  washed  out of the soil and phosphate  detergents  from
untreated  water,  enter natural  water  systems,  such as streams,  rivers,  lakes, and seas.
These  dissolved  minerals  are valuable  nutrients  for plants,  and their discharge  into the
water  systems  accelerates  the growth  of surface-water  plants,  such as algae.  As a result,
less light reaches  the bottom-living  plants,  which  reduces  the photosynthesis  they need  to
live, and they die. When  these aquatic  plants die, they rot under  the action  of bacteria
which  multiply  greatly  and consume  the oxygen  dissolved  in the water  at a rate faster  than
natural  aeration  or photosynthesis  can replenish.  Thus,  the amount  of oxygen  in the water
decreases.  This depletion  of oxygen  kills aquatic  animals  like fish. This sequence  of events
is called  eutrophication.
Insecticides  (pesticides)  and herbicides  applied  in agriculture  may also be washed  into
lakes,  rivers,  streams  and seas. Some  of  the insecticides  and herbicides  do not decompose
easily  and are persistent  in the environment.  Residues  of these insecticides  and herbicides
may enter  the food chains  and accumulate  in an organism  that is consumed  by the next
organism.  The increasing  amount  of insecticide  and herbicide  residue  in the bodies  of
animals  causes  health  and behavioural  problems.
The release  of heavy  metal ions, acidic  and/or  basic residues  from industrial  processes  into
natural  water  systems,  such as lakes and rivers,  causes  pH changes  in the water. Water
organisms  need specific  ranges  of water  pH to survive,  so these changes  in pH can kill
them. In the same way, increasing  concentrations  of toxic metal ions kills some aquatic
organisms.
The release  of untreated  sewage  to natural  water  systems  can spread  water-borne  diseases
such as cholera,  typhoid,  hepatitis,  and polio.
Methods  of Reducing  Water  Pollution:
Treatment  of water  before  discharge  into rivers and lakes.
2. Toavoid  unnatural  temperature  changes  in natural  water  systems,  industries  should
not discharge  heat-ladened  water  into them.
Recycling  industrial  and agricultural  wastes.
4. Using  moderate  amounts  of agricultural  chemicals  and increasing  the use of organic
fertilizers  and biological  methods  to control  pests.

Land Pollution
Activity  4.27
Discuss  the following  issues and present  your answer  to your class.
1. Do you observe  any pollution  of land in your environment?
2. What are the causes  of land pollution?
3. Do you observe  soil erosion in your area? What three major things do you believe
elected officials  should take to decrease  soil erosion  in the region you live?
4. What should be your responsibility  in solving  the land pollution  problems?
Land pollution  is caused  by things we put into it. It results from the spillage  of oil,
leaching of harmful chemicals  and heavy metal ions, and dumping  of non-
biodegradable  wastes such as plastics.
Factors  involved  in land  pollution  include:
¢ Spillages  of oil from leaking  pipelines.
¢ Harmful  heavy  metal ions from buried  waste  leaching  into water  systems.
¢ Leaching  of  harmful  chemicals  from corroded  metal drums  which  have been buried
underground.
¢ Dumping  of non-biodegradable  (do not decompose  by the action of bacteria)
wastes  like plastics  which  remain  unchanged  in the soil for decades  or hundreds  of
years. Their  accumulation  in the soil hinders  air and water  movement  and affects  the
growth  of plants.
¢ Excessive  use of synthetic  fertilisers  in agricultural  activities  also contributes  towards
land pollution.
What are the contributions  of commercial  inorganic  fertilizers  to land  pollution?

A. you wander through the supermarket,  some advertising  claims catch
your eye. “Certified  organic”  and “all natural”  are stamped  on the labels
of some foods. Other labels claim that the foods are “chemical  free.” As a
chemistry  student,  you are aware that these labels may be misleading.  Are
all “chemicals”  harmful  in food, as some of the current  advertising  suggests?
Many terms are used inaccurately  in everyday  life. The word “natural”
is often used in a manner  suggesting  that all natural  compounds  are safe
and healthy.  Similarly,  the word “chemical”  is commonly  used to refer to
artificial  compounds  only. The food industry  uses “organic”  to indicate
foods that have been grown  without  the use of pesticides,  herbicides,
fertilizers,  hormones,  and other synthetic  chemicals.  The original  meaning
of the word “organic”  refers to anything  that is or has been alive. In this
sense, all vegetables  are organic,  no matter  how they are grown.
Organic  chemistry  is the study of compounds  that are based on
carbon.  Natural  gas, rubbing  alcohol,  aspirin,  and the compounds  that
give fragrance  to a rose, are all organic  compounds.  In this chapter,  you
will learn how to identify  and name molecules  from the basic families  of
organic  compounds.  You will be introduced  to the shape, structure,  and
properties  of different  types of organic  compounds.

Bonding  and the
Shape of Organic  Molecules
Early scientists  defined  organic  compounds  as compounds  that originate
from living things.  In 1828, however,  the German  chemist  Friedrich  Wohler
(1800-1882)  made an organic  compound  called urea, CO(NHz2)2,  out of an
inorganic  compound  called ammonium  cyanate,  NH,CN.  Urea is found in
the urine of mammals.  This was the first time in history  that a compound
normally  made only by living things  was made from a non-living  sub-
stance.  Since Wohler  had discovered  that organic  compounds  can be made
without  the involvement  of a life process, a new definition  was required.
Organic  compounds  are now defined  as compounds  that are based on
carbon.  They usually  contain  carbon-carbon  and carbon-hydrogen  bonds.
The Carbon  Atom
There are several  million  organic  compounds,  but only about a quarter
of a million  inorganic  compounds  (compounds  that are not based on
carbon).  Why are there so many organic  compounds?  The answer  lies in
the bonding  properties  of carbon.
As shown  in Figure 1.1, each carbon  atom usually  forms a total of
four covalent  bonds. Thus, a carbon  atom can connect  to as many as four
other atoms. Carbon  can bond to many other types of atoms,  including
hydrogen,  oxygen,  and nitrogen.
H
-C’°’+4H’  —~ H:C:H
H
| Figure 1.1 | This Lewis structure  shows methane,  the simplest  organic compound.  The
carbon  atom has four valence  electrons,  and it obtains  four more electrons  by forming  four
covalent  bonds with the four hydrogen  atoms.
In addition,  carbon  atoms can form strong  single, double,  or triple bonds
with other carbon  atoms.  In a single carbon-carbon  bond, one pair of
electrons  is shared  between  two carbon  atoms.  In a double  bond, two
pairs of electrons  are shared  between  two atoms.  In a triple bond, three
pairs of electrons  are shared  between  two atoms.
Molecules  that contain  only single carbon-carbon  bonds are saturated.
In other words,  all carbon  atoms are bonded  to the maximum  number  of
other atoms: four. No more bonding  can occur. Molecules  that contain
double  or triple carbon-carbon  bonds are unsaturated.  The carbon  atoms
on either side of the double  or triple bond are bonded  to less than four
atoms each. There is potential  for more atoms to bond to each of these
carbon  atoms.
Carbon’s  unique  bonding  properties  allow the formation  of a
variety  of structures,  including  chains  and rings of many shapes  and
sizes. Figure 1.2 on the next page illustrates  some of the many shapes
that can be formed  from a backbone  of carbon  atoms. This figure includes
examples  of three types of structural  diagrams  that are used to depict
organic  molecules.  (The Concepts  and Skills Review  contains  a further
review  of these types of structural  diagrams.)1.1

In the chapter  opener,  you
considered  how the terms
“natural”  and “chemical”  are
used inaccurately.  A natural
substance  is a substance  that
occurs in nature and is not
artificial. A chemical  is any
substance  that has been made
using chemical  processes  in
a laboratory.  A chemical  can
also be defined  as any sub-
stance  that is composed  of
atoms.  This definition  covers
most things on Earth. Go to the

Carbon  compounds  in which  carbon  forms only single bonds have a

affects  the shape of a molecule.

The type of bonding  affects  the shape and
movement  of a molecule.  In this ExpressLab,
you will build several  molecules  to examine  the
shape and character  of their bonds.

3. Molecular  model kits are a good representation
of real atomic  geometry.  Are you able to make a
quadruple  bond between  two atoms  with your
model kit? What does this tell you about real
carbon bonding?
As you observed  in the ExpressLab,  the shape of a molecule  depends  on
the type of bond. Table 1.1 describes  some shapes  that you must know for
your study of organic  chemistry.  In Unit 2, you will learn more about why
different  shapes  and angles form around  an atom.

single  bonds An oxygen  atom also has two pairs of non-bonding
electrons,  called  lone pairs. Since there are a total
of four electron  pairs around  a single-bonded
oxygen  atom, the shape around  this oxygen  atom
is a variation  of the tetrahedral  shape. Because
there are only two bonds,  however,  the shape
around  a single-bonded  oxygen  atom is usually
referred  to as bent.
Three-Dimensional  Structural  Diagrams
Two-dimensional  structural  diagrams  of organic  compounds,  such as
condensed  structural  diagrams  and line structural  diagrams,  work well
for flat molecules.  As shown  in the table above, however,  molecules
containing  single-bonded  carbon  atoms are not flat.
You can use a three-dimensional  structural  diagram  to draw the tetra-
hedral shape around  a single-bonded  carbon  atom. In a three-dimensional
diagram,  wedges  are used to give the impression  that an atom or group is
coming  forward,  out of the page. Dashed  or dotted  lines are used to show
that an atom or group is receding,  or being pushed  back into the page. In
Figure 1.3, the Cl atom is coming forward, and the Br atom is behind. The CONCEPT  CHECK

CONCEPT  CHECK
In this unit, you will encounter
the following  polar bonds:
C—|, C—F, C—O, O—H,
N—H, and C—N. Use the
electronegativities  in the
periodic  table to discover
which atom in each bond has
a partial negative  charge,  and
which has a partial positive
charge.
8Molecular  Shape and Polarity
The three-dimensional  shape of a molecule  is particularly  important  when
the molecule  contains  polar covalent  bonds.  As you may recall from your
previous  chemistry  course,  a polar covalent  bond is a covalent  bond
between  two atoms with different  electronegativities.
Electronegativity  is a measure  of how strongly  an atom attracts
electrons  in a chemical  bond. The electrons  in a polar covalent  bond are
attracted  more strongly  to the atom with the higher  electronegativity.  This
atom has a partial  negative  charge,  while the other atom has a partial  posi-
tive charge.  Thus, every polar bond has a bond dipole:  a partial  negative
charge  and a partial  positive  charge,  separated  by the length  of the bond.
Figure 1.4 illustrates  the polarity  of a double  carbon-oxygen  bond. Oxygen
has a higher  electronegativity  than carbon.  Therefore,  the oxygen  atom in
a carbon-oxygen  bond has a partial  negative  charge,  and the carbon  atom
has a partial  positive  charge.

GFETISEE  Dipoles  are often represented  using vectors.  Vectors  are arrows  that have
direction  and location  in space.
Other examples  of polar covalent  bonds include  C—O, O—H,
and N—H.  Carbon  and hydrogen  attract  electrons  to almost  the same
degree.  Therefore,  when carbon  is bonded  to another  carbon  atom or
to a hydrogen  atom, the bond is not usually  considered  to be polar. For
example,  C—C bonds are considered  to be non-polar.
Predicting  Molecular  Polarity
A molecule  is considered  to be polar, or to have a molecular  polarity,
when the molecule  has an overall  imbalance  of charge.  That is, the
molecule  has a region  with a partial  positive  charge,  and a region  with a
partial  negative  charge.  Surprisingly,  not all molecules  with polar bonds
are polar molecules.  For example,  a carbon  dioxide  molecule  has two
polar C=O bonds,  but it is not a polar molecule.  On the other hand, a
water molecule  has two polar O—H  bonds,  and it is a polar molecule.
How do you predict  whether  or not a molecule  that contains  polar bonds
has an overall  molecular  polarity?  To determine  molecular  polarity,  you
must consider  the shape of the molecule  and the bond dipoles  within  the
molecule.
If equal bond dipoles  act in opposite  directions  in three-dimensional
space, they counteract  each other. A molecule  with identical  polar bonds
that point in opposite  directions  is not polar. Figure 1.5 shows  two
examples,  carbon  dioxide  and carbon  tetrachloride.  Carbon  dioxide,  COz,
has two polar C=O bonds acting in opposite  directions,  so the molecule
is non-polar.  Carbon  tetrachloride,  CCli, has four polar C—Cl  bonds in
a tetrahedral  shape. You can prove mathematically  that four identical
dipoles,  pointing  toward  the vertices  of a tetrahedron,  counteract  each
other exactly.  (Note that this mathematical  proof  only applies  if all four
bonds are identical.)  Therefore,  carbon  tetrachloride  is also non-polar.
MEHR ¢ Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
GGETEERED  The red colour indicates  a region of negative  charge,  and the blue colour
indicates  a region of positive  charge.  In non-polar  molecules,  such as carbon dioxide  (A) and
carbon  tetrachloride  (B), the charges  are distributed  evenly  around  the molecule.
If the bond dipoles  in a molecule  do not counteract  each other exactly,  the
molecule  is polar. Two examples  are water, H2,O, and chloroform,  CHCl;,
shown  in Figure 1.6. Although  each molecule  has polar bonds,  the bond
dipoles  do not act in exactly  opposite  directions.  The bond dipoles  do not
counteract  each other, so these two molecules  are polar.
HY Su ae ae cl’
Cl
(GETISEE  In polar molecules,  such as water (A) and chloroform  (B), the charges  are
distributed  unevenly  around  the molecule.  One part of the molecule  has an overall negative
charge,  and another  part has an overall positive  charge.
The steps below summarize  how to predict  whether  or not a molecule
is polar. The Sample  Problem  that follows  gives three examples.
Note: For the purpose  of predicting  molecular  polarity,  you can assume
that C—H  bonds are non-polar.  In fact, they have a very low polarity.
Step1 Does the molecule  have polar bonds?  If your answer  is no, see
below.  If your answer  is yes, go to step 2.
If a molecule  has no polar bonds,  it is non-polar.
Examples:  CH;CH,CH;,  CH, == CH,
Step 2 Is there more than one polar bond?  If your answer  is no, see below.
If your answer  is yes, go to step 3.
Ifa molecule  contains  only one polar bond, it is polar.
Examples:  CH3;Cl,  CH3CH,CH,Cl
Step 3 Do the bond dipoles  act in opposite  directions  and counteract  each
other? Use your knowledge  of three-dimensional  molecular  shapes
to help you answer  this question.  If in doubt, use a molecular  model
to help you visualize  the shape of the molecule.
If a molecule  contains  bond dipoles  that do not counteract  each
other, the molecule  is polar.
Examples:  H,0, CHCl,
If the molecule  contains  dipoles  that counteract  each other, the
molecule  is non-polar.

12Hydrocarbons
In this section,  you will review  the structure  and names  of hydrocarbons.
As you may recall from your previous  chemistry  studies,  hydrocarbons
are the simplest  type of organic  compound.  Hydrocarbons  are composed
entirely  of carbon  and hydrogen  atoms, and are widely  used as fuels.
Gasoline,  propane,  and natural  gas are common  examples  of hydrocarbons.
Because  they contain  only carbon  and hydrogen  atoms,  hydrocarbons  are
non-polar  compounds.
Scientists  classify  hydrocarbons  as either  aliphatic  or aromatic.  An
aliphatic  hydrocarbon  contains  carbon  atoms that are bonded  in one or
more chains  and rings. The carbon  atoms have single, double,  or triple
bonds.  Aliphatic  hydrocarbons  include  straight  chain and cyclic alkanes,
alkenes,  and alkynes.  An aromatic  hydrocarbon  is a hydrocarbon  based
on the aromatic  benzene  group. You will encouter  this group later in
the section.  Benzene  is the simplest  aromatic  compound.  Its bonding
arrangement  results  in special  molecular  stability.
Alkanes,  Alkenes,  and Alkynes
An alkane  is a hydrocarbon  that has only single bonds.  Alkanes  that do not
contain  rings have the formula  C,H2,+42.  An alkane  in the shape of a ring is
called a cycloalkane.  Cycloalkanes  have the formula  C,H2,. An alkene  is a
compound  that has at least one double  bond. Straight-chain  alkenes  with
one double  bond have the same formula  as cycloalkanes,  C,Hon.
A double  bond involves  two pairs of electrons.  In a double  bond, one
pair of electrons  forms a single bond and the other pair forms an addition-
al, weaker  bond. The electrons  in the additional,  weaker  bond react faster
than the electrons  in the single bond. Thus, carbon-carbon  double  bonds
are more reactive  than carbon-carbon  single bonds.  When an alkene
reacts, the reaction  almost  always  occurs at the site of the double  bond.
A functional  group is a reactive  group of bonded  atoms that appears
in all the members  of a chemical  family.  Each functional  group reacts in a
characteristic  way. Thus, functional  groups  help to determine  the physical
and chemical  properties  of compounds.  For example,  the reactive  double
bond is the functional  group for an alkene.  In this course,  you will
encounter  many different  functional  groups.
An alkyne  is a compound  that has at least one triple bond. A straight-
chain alkyne  with one triple bond has the formula  C,,H2,_  2. Triple bonds
‘ are even more reactive than double bonds. The functional  group for an
alkyne  is the triple bond.
Figure 1.7 gives examples  of an alkane,  a cycloalkane,  an alkene,  and
an alkyne.

General  Rules for Naming  Organic  Compounds
The International  Union  of Pure and Applied  Chemistry  (IUPAC)  has set
standard  rules for naming  organic  compounds.  The systematic  (or IUPAC)
names  of alkanes  and most other organic  compounds  follow  the same
pattern,  shown  below.
prefix ++ root + suffix
The Root: How Long Is the Main Chain?
The root of a compound’s  name indicates  the number  of carbon  atoms in
the main (parent)  chain or ring. Table 1.2 gives the roots for hydrocarbon
chains  that are up to ten carbons  long. To determine  which  root to use,
count the carbons  in the main chain, or main ring, of the compound.  If the
compound  is an alkene or alkyne,  the main chain or ring must include  the
multiple  bond.

CHs
(A) There are six carbons  in the main chain. The root is -hex-. (B) There are five
carbons  in the main ring. The root is -pent-.
The Suffix:  What Family  Does the Compound  Belong  To?
The suffix indicates  the type of compound,  according  to the functional
groups  present.  (See Table 1.4 on page 22.) As you progress  through  this
chapter,  you will learn the suffixes  for different  chemical  families.  In your
previous  chemistry  course,  you learned  the suffixes  -ane for alkanes,  -ene
for alkenes,  and -yne for alkynes.  Thus, an alkane  composed  of six carbon
atoms in a chain is called hexane.  An alkene  with three carbons  is called
propene.

butylThe Prefix:  What Is Attached  to the Main Chain?
The prefix  indicates  the name and location  of each branch  and functional
group on the main carbon  chain. Most organic  compounds  have branches,
called alkyl groups,  attached  to the main chain. An alkyl group is obtained
by removing  one hydrogen  atom from an alkane.  To name an alkyl! group,
change  the -ane suffix to -yl. For example,  — CH; is the alkyl group that is
derived  from methane,  CHg. It is called the methyl  group,  taken from the
root meth-. Table 1.3 gives the names of the most common  alkyl! groups.

How to Name Hydrocarbons
Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
Step 4
Step 5
MEHR * Unit 1 Organic  ChemistryFind the root: Identify  the longest  chain or ring in the hydrocarbon.
If the hydrocarbon  is an alkene or an alkyne,  make sure that you
include  any multiple  bonds in the main chain. Remember  that the
chain does not have to be in a straight  line. Count  the number  of
carbon  atoms in the main chain to obtain  the root. If it is a cyclic
compound,  add the prefix -cyclo-  before the root.
Find the suffix: If the hydrocarbon  is an alkane,  use the suffix -ane.
Use -ene if the hydrocarbon  is an alkene.  Use -yne if the hydrocarbon
is an alkyne.  If more than one double  or triple bond is present,  use
the prefix di- (2) or tri- (3) before  the suffix to indicate  the number
of multiple  bonds.
Give a position  number  to every carbon  atom in the main chain.
Start from the end that gives you the lowest  possible  position
number  for the double  or triple bond, if there is one. If there is no
double  or triple bond, number  the compound  so that the branches
have the lowest  possible  position  numbers.
Find the prefix: Name each branch  as an alkyl group, and give it
a position  number.  If more than one branch  is present,  write the
names  of the branches  in alphabetical  order. Put the position
number  of any double  or triple bonds after the position  numbers
and names of the branches,  just before the root. This is the prefix.
Note: Use the carbon  atom with the /Jowest  position  number  to give
the location  of a double  or triple bond.
Put the name together:  prefix + root + suffix.
Naming  Alkanes
Problem
Name the following  alkanes. 4
5 3
(a) CH3 — CH—CH3 (b)
3 2 1 1 2
CH; CH,CH3
Solution
(a) Step 1 Find the root: The longest  chain has three carbon  atoms,  so the
root is -prop-.
Step 2 Find the suffix: The suffix is -ane.
Steps 3 and 4 Find the prefix: A methyl  group is attached  to carbon
number  2. The prefix is 2-methyl.
Step 5 The full name is 2-methylpropane.
(b) Steps1 and2 Find the root and suffix: The main ring has five carbon
atoms, so the root is -pent-. Add the prefix -cyclo-.  The suffix is -ane.
Steps 3 and 4 Find the prefix: Start numbering  at the ethyl branch.  The
prefix is 1-ethyl,  or just ethyl.
Step5 The full name is 1-ethylcyclopentane.
Naming  an Alkene
Problem
Name the following  alkene.
CHs
1 2 |3 4 5 6 7
CH; CH2CHs
Solution
Step 1 Find the root: The longest  chain in the molecule  has seven carbon
atoms. The root is -hept-.
Step 2 Find the suffix: The suffix is -ene. The root and suffix together  are
-heptene.
Step 3 Numbering  the chain from the left, in this case, gives the smallest
position  number  for the double  bond.
Step 4 Find the prefix: Two methyl  groups  are attached  to carbon  number
2. One ethyl group is attached  to carbon  number  3. There is a
double  bond at position  3. The prefix is 3-ethyl-2,2-dimethyl-3-.
Step5 The full name is 3-ethyl-2,2-dimethy]-3-heptene.
\ SPROBLEM  TIPS
e Use hyphens  to separate
words  from numbers.
Use commas  to separate
numbers.
If there is a ring, itis
usually  taken as the main
chain. Follow  the same
rules to name cyclic
compounds  that have
branches  attached.
Include  the prefix -cyclo-
after the names and
position  numbers  of the
branches,  directly  before
the root: for example,
2-methyl-1-cyclohexene.

To draw a condensed  structural  diagram  of a hydrocarbon,  follow  the
steps below. Then examine  the Sample  Problem  that follows.
How to Draw Hydrocarbons
Step1 Draw the carbon  atoms of the main chain. Leave space after each
carbon  atom for bonds and hydrogen  atoms to be added later.
Number  the carbon  atoms.
Step 2 Draw any single, double,  or triple bonds  between  the carbon  atoms.
Step 3 Add the branches  to the appropriate  carbon  atoms of the main chain.
Step 4 Add hydrogen  atoms so that each carbon  atom forms  a total of
4 bonds.  Remember  that double  bonds count as 2 bonds and triple
bonds count as 3 bonds.
Drawing  an Alkane
Problem
Draw a condensed  structural  diagram  for 3-ethyl-2-methylhexane.
Solution
Step1 The main chain is hexane.  Therefore,  there are six carbon  atoms.
Step 2 This compound  is an alkane,  so all carbon-carbon  bonds are single.
Step 3 The ethyl group is attached  to carbon  number  3. The methyl  group
is attached  to carbon  number  2.
Step 4 Add hydrogen  atoms so that each carbon  atom forms 4 bonds.

The Art and Science  of Perfumery
Since 1932, The Quiggs  have manufactured  perfume
compounds  for cosmetics,  toiletries,  soaps, air fresh-
eners, candles,  detergents,  and industrial  cleaning
products.
Jeff Quigg says the mixing  of a perfume  is “a
trial and error process.”  An experienced  perfumer
must memorize  a vast library  of hundreds  or even
thousands  of individual  scents and combinations  of
scents.  Perfume  ingredients  can be divided  into
natural  essential  oils (derived  directly  from plants)
and aromatic  chemicals  (synthetically  produced
fragrance  components).
Essential  oils are organic  compounds  derived
from flowers,  seeds, leaves,  roots, resins, and citrus
fruits. The structures  of many fragrant  compounds
have been studied,  and processes  for making  these
valuable  compounds  in a laboratory  have been
developed.  There are now approximately  5000
synthetically  produced  chemicals  that are available
to a perfumer.  These chemicals  include  vanillin,
rose oxides,  and the damascones,  or rose ketones.
An aspiring  perfumer  must have  a discrimi-
nating sense of smell. As well, a perfumist  should
obtain at least a bachelor  of science  degree  in
chemistry,  or a degree  in chemical  engineering.
There are few formal schools  for perfumers,  socompanies  usually  train perfumers  in-house.
The training  takes five to ten years to complete.
Although  inventors  are trying to develop
electronic  and artificial  noses to detect odours,  they
have not yet been able to duplicate  the sensitive
nose of a skilled,  trained,  and talented  perfumer.
Making  Career  Connections
1. Perfume  schools  exist, but admission  is very
competitive.  One of these schools  is the Institut
Supérieur  International  du Parfum,  de la
Cosmétique  et de l’Aromatique  Alimentaire
(ISIPCA,  or International  High Institute  of
Perfume,  Cosmetic  and Food Flavouring).  The
ISIPCA  is located  in Versailles,  France.  You can
find out more about the ISIPCA  by logging  onto
www.mcgrawhill.ca/links/chemistry12  and
clicking  on Web Links. Use the Internet  or a
library  to find out more about perfume  schools
and training  for perfumers.
2. The fragrance  industry  is closely  linked to the
flavour  industry.  Many of the skills required  of a
perfumer  are also required  of a flavourist.  Find
out more about the flavour  industry.  Contact  the
chemistry  department  of a university  to find out
more about flavour  chemistry.

If you completed  the Concept  Check  activity  on page 12, you drew a
possible  structure  for benzene.  For many years, scientists  could not
determine  the structure  of benzene.  From its molecular  formula,  CgHe.,
scientists  reasoned  that it should  contain  two double  bonds and one triple
bond, or even two triple bonds.  Benzene,  however,  does not undergo  the
same reactions  as other compounds  with double  or triple bonds.
We know today that benzene  is a cyclic compound  with the equivalent
of three double  bonds and three single bonds,  as shown  in Figure 1.9(A).
However,  the electrons  that form the double  bonds in benzene  are spread
out and shared  over the whole molecule.  Thus, benzene  actually  has six
identical  bonds, each one half-way  between  a single and a double  bond.
These bonds are much more stable than ordinary  double  bonds and do
not react in the same way. Figure 1.9(B) shows a more accurate  way to
represent  the bonding  in benzene.  Molecules  with this type of special
electron  sharing  are called aromatic  compounds.  As mentioned  earlier,
benzene  is the simplest  aromatic  compound.
Figure 1.10 illustrates  some common  aromatic  compounds.  To name
an aromatic  compound,  follow  the steps below. Figure 1.11 gives an
example.

explosives,  such as trinitrotoluene  (TNT). Phenylethene,  with the common  name styrene,  is an
important  ingredient  in the production  of plastics  and rubber.
Naming  an Aromatic  Hydrocarbon
Step1 Number  the carbons  in the benzene  ring. If more than one type of
branch  is attached  to the ring, start numbering  at the carbon  with
the highest  priority  (or most complex)  group. (See the Problem  Tip.)
Step 2 Name any branches  that are attached  to the benzene  ring. Give
these branches  position  numbers.  If only one branch  is attached  to
a benzene  ring, you do not need to include  a position  number.
Step3 Place the branch  numbers  and names as a prefix before the root,
benzene.

name of this compound  is 1,3-diethylbenzene.

Single-Bonded  Functional  Groups
When  you cut yourself,  it is often a good idea to swab the cut with
rubbing  alcohol  to disinfect  it. Most rubbing  alcohols  that are sold in
drugstores  are based on 2-propanol  (common  name: isopropanol),  C;3HsO0.
You can also swab a cut with a rubbing  alcohol  based on ethanol,  C,H,O.
Often it is hard to tell the difference  between  these two compounds.  Both
have a sharp smell, and both evaporate  quickly.  Both are effective  at
killing  bacteria  and disinfecting  wounds.  What is the connection  between
these compounds?  Why is their behaviour  so similar?
Functional  Groups
Both 2-propanol  and ethanol  contain  the same functional  group, an
— OH (hydroxyl)  group,  as shown  in Figure 1.12. Because  ethanol  and
2-propanol  have the same OH functional  group,  their behaviour  is similar.
OH
2-propanol ethanol
| Figure 1.12, Ethanol and 2-propanol  both belong to the alcohol family.
The general  formula  for a family  of simple  organic  compounds  is
R + functional  group.  The letter R stands for any alkyl group. (If more
than one alkyl group is present,  R’ and R” are also used.) For example,
the general  formula  R—OH  refers to any of the following  compounds:
Organic  compounds  are named  according  to their functional  group.
Generally,  the suffix of a compound’s  name indicates  the most important
functional  group in the molecule.  For example,  the suffix -ene indicates
the presence  of a double  bond, and the suffix -ol indicates  the presence
of a hydroxyl  group.
Functional  groups  are a useful way to classify  organic  compounds,
for two reasons:
1. Compounds  with the same  functional  group often have similar
physical  properties.  In the next two sections,  you will learn to
recognize  various  functional  groups.  You will use functional  groups
to help you predict  the physical  properties  of compounds.
2. Compounds  with the same  functional  group react chemically  in very
similar  ways. In Chapter  2, you will learn how compounds  with each
functional  group react.
Table 1.4, on the next page, lists some of the most common
functional  groups.1.3

Physical  Properties  and Forces Between  Molecules
Organic  compounds  that have the same functional  group often have
similar  physical  properties,  such as boiling  points,  melting  points,  and
solubilities.  Physical  properties  are largely  determined  by intermolecular
forces,  the forces of attraction  and repulsion  between  particles.  Three
types of intermolecular  forces are introduced  below.  You will examine
these forces further  in Chapter  4.
e Hydrogen  bonding  is a strong  intermolecular  attraction  between  the
hydrogen  atom from an N—H,  O—H, or F—H group on one molecule,
and a nitrogen,  oxygen,  or fluorine  atom on another  molecule.
e The attractive  forces between  polar molecules  are called dipole-dipole
interactions.  These forces cause polar molecules  to cling to each other.
e Dispersion  forces are attractive  forces that occur between  all covalent
molecules.  These forces are usually  very weak for small molecules,  but
they strengthen  as the size of the molecule  increases.
The process  that is outlined  on the next page will help you to predict  the
physical  properties  of organic  compounds  by examining  the intermolecular
forces between  molecules.  As you progress  through  the chapter,  referring
back to this process  will enable  you to understand  the reasons  behind
trends  in physical  properties.
22 MHR-* Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
Intermolecular  Forces  and Physical  Properties
Draw two or three molecules  of the same organic  compound  close
together  on a page. If you are considering  the solubility  of one com-
pound  in another,  sketch  the two different  molecules  close together.
Ask the following  questions  about the intermolecular  interactions
between  the molecules  of each compound:
1. Can the molecules  form hydrogen  bonds?
If the molecules  have O—H,  N—H,  or
H—F bonds,  they can form hydrogen O O
bonds with themselves  and with water. HW Nu HW’ Nu
The diagram  to the right illustrates Oe
hydrogen  bonding  between  water / Nu
molecules.  If the molecules  contain
O, N, or F atoms that are not bonded
to hydrogen  atoms,  they may accept  hydrogen  bonds from water,
even though  they cannot  form hydrogen  bonds with themselves.
Molecules  that can form hydrogen  bonds with themselves  have
a higher  boiling  point than similar  molecules  that cannot  form
hydrogen  bonds with themselves.  For example,  alcohols  can form
hydrogen  bonds,  but alkanes  cannot.  Therefore,  alcohols  have
higher  boiling  points than alkanes.
Molecules  that can form hydrogen  bonds with water, or can
accept  hydrogen  bonds  from water, are usually  soluble  in water.
For example,  many alcohols  are soluble  in water because  they can
form hydrogen  bonds with water.
2. Are the molecules  polar?
The molecules  are polar if they have polar bonds,  and if these
bonds do not act in opposite  directions  and counteract  each other.
Polar molecules  are attracted  to each other by dipole-dipole  forces.
Polar  molecules  usually  have a higher  boiling  point than
similar  non-polar  molecules.  Also, polar  molecules  that can form
hydrogen  bonds  have an even higher  boiling  point than polar
molecules  that cannot  form hydrogen  bonds. For example,  ethanol,
CH3CH,0H,  is polar. Its molecules  can form hydrogen  bonds.
Methoxymethane,  CH;0CHs3,  is an isomer  of ethanol.  It is also
polar, but its molecules  cannot  form hydrogen  bonds.  Thus,
ethanol  has a higher  boiling  point than methoxymethane.  Both of
these compounds  have a higher  boiling  point than the non-polar
molecule  ethane,  CH3;CH3.
Polar  molecules  with a large non-polar  hydrocarbon  part are
less polar than polar  molecules  with a smaller  non-polar  hydrocar-
bon part. For example,  octanol,  CH;CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,0OH,
is less polar than ethanol,  CH;CH,OH.
Polar  molecules  with a large hydrocarbon  part are less soluble
in water than polar  molecules  with a smaller  hydrocarbon  part.
For example,  octanol,  CH3CH,CH,CH,CH2,CH,CH2CH,20H,  is less

ThoughtLab3. How strong  are the dispersion  forces?
Dispersion  forces are weak intermolecular  forces.  They are stronger,
however,  when the hydrocarbon  part of a molecule  is very large.
Thus, a large molecule  has stronger  dispersion  interactions  than a
smaller  molecule.
A molecule  with a greater  number  of carbon  atoms usually  has
a higher  boiling  point than the same type of molecule  with fewer
carbon  atoms. For example,  hexane,  CH;CH,CH,CH,CH.CH;  has a
higher  boiling  point than ethane,  CH3CH3.
The melting  points of organic  compounds  follow  approximately
the same trend as their boiling  points.  There are some anomalies,
however,  due to more complex  forces of bonding  in solids.
In the following  ThoughtLab  you will use the process  in the box above to
predict  and compare  the physical  properties  of some organic  compounds.

Compounds  With Single-Bonded  Functional  Groups
Alcohols,  alkyl halides,  ethers,  and amines  all have functional  groups
with single bonds.  These compounds  have many interesting  uses in
daily life. As you learn how to identify  and name these compounds,  think
about how the intermolecular  forces between  their molecules  affect their
properties  and uses.
Alcohols
An alcohol  is an organic  compound  that contains  the —OH functional
group. Depending  on the position  of the hydroxyl]  group, an alcohol
can be primary,  secondary,  or tertiary.  Figure 1.13 gives some examples
of alcohols.

Step1 Locate  the longest  chain that contains  an —OH  group attached  to
one of the carbon  atoms. Name the parent  alkane.
Step 2 Replace  the -e at the end of the name of the parent  alkane  with -ol.
Step 3 Add a position  number  before  the root of the name to indicate  the
location  of the —-OH  group. (Remember  to number  the main chain
of the hydrocarbon  so that the hydroxyl  group has the lowest  possi-
ble position  number.)  If there is more than one —OH  group, leave
the -e in the name of the parent  alkane,  and put the appropriate
prefix (di-, tri-, or tetra-) before the suffix -ol.
Step 4 Name and number  any other branches  on the main chain. Add the
name of these branches  to the prefix.
Step5 Put the name together:  prefix + root + suffix.
Naming  an Alcohol
Problem
Name the following  alcohol.  Identify  it as primary,  secondary,
or tertiary.
Solution
Step1 The main chain has six carbon  atoms. The name of the parent
alkane  is hexane.
Step 2 Replacing  -e with -ol gives hexanol.
Step 3 Add a position  number  for the —OH  group, to obtain 1-hexanol.
Step 4 A methyl!  group is present  at the third carbon.  The prefix
is 3-methyl.
Step5 The full name is 3-methyl-1-hexanol.  This is a primary  alcohol.

Table 1.6 lists some common  physical  properties  of alcohols.  As
you learned  earlier  in this chapter,  alcohols  are polar molecules  that
experience  hydrogen  bonding.  The physical  properties  of alcohols
depend  on these characteristics.
Table 1.6 Physical  Properties  of Alcohols
Polarity  of functional  group |The O—H  bond is very polar. As the number  of carbon
atoms in an alcohol  becomes  larger, the alkyl group’s
non-polar  nature  becomes  more important  than the polar
O—H  bond. Therefore  small alcohols  are more polar
than alcohols  with large hydrocarbon  portions.
Hydrogen  bonding Alcohols  experience  hydrogen  bonding  with other
alcohol  molecules  and with water.
Solubility  in water The capacity  of alcohols  for hydrogen  bonding  makes
them extremely  soluble  in water. Methanol  and ethanol
are miscible  (infinitely  soluble)  with water. The
solubility  of an alcohol  decreases  as the number  of
carbon  atoms increases.
Melting  and boiling  points | Due to the strength  of the hydrogen  bonding,  most
alcohols  have higher  melting  and boiling  points than
alkanes  with the same number  of carbon  atoms.  Most
alcohols  are liquids  at room temperature.
Additional  Characteristics  of Alcohols
e Alcohols  are extremely  flammable,  and should  be treated  with caution.
e Most alcohols  are poisonous.  Methanol  can cause blindness  or death
when consumed.  Ethanol  is consumed  widely  in moderate  quantities,
but it causes  impairment  and/or  death when consumed  in excess.

28Alkyl Halides
An alkyl halide (also known  as a haloalkane)  is an alkane  in which  one
or more hydrogen  atoms have been replaced  with halogen  atoms, such
as F, Cl, Br, or I. The functional  group of alkyl halides  is R—X,  where  X
represents  a halogen  atom. Alkyl! halides  are similar  in structure,  polarity,
and reactivity  to alcohols.  To name an alkyl halide,  first name the parent
hydrocarbon.  Then use the prefix fluoro-,  chloro-,  bromo-,  or iodo-, with a
position  number,  to indicate  the presence  of a fluorine  atom, chlorine
atom, bromine  atom, or iodine atom. The following  Sample  Problem
shows how to name an alky] halide.
Naming  an Alkyl Halide
Problem
Name the following  compound.
Solution
The parent  hydrocarbon  of this compound  is cyclohexane.  There are two
bromine  atoms attached  at position  numbers  1 and 3. Therefore,  part
of the prefix is 1,3-dibromo-.  There is also a methyl  group at position
number  4. Because  the groups  are put in alphabetical  order, the full
prefix is 1,3-dibromo-4-methyl-.  (The ring is numbered  so that the
two bromine  atoms have the lowest  possible  position  numbers.  See
the Problem  Tip on page 18.) The full name of the compound  is
1,3-dibromo-4-methylcyclohexane.

Ethers
Suppose  that you removed  the H atom from the — OH group of an
alcohol.  This would  leave space for another  alkyl group to attach  to the
oxygen  atom.
The compound  you have just made is called an ether. An ether is an
organic  compound  that has two alkyl groups  joined  by an oxygen  atom.
The general  formula  of an ether is R—O—R.  You can think of alcohols
and ethers as derivatives  of the water molecule,  as shown  in Figure 1.14.

Table 1.7 describes  some physical  properties  of ethers. Like alcohols,
ethers are polar molecules.  Ethers, however,  cannot  form hydrogen  bonds
with themselves.  The physical  properties  of ethers depend  on these
characteristics.
MHR « Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
Table 1.7 Physical  Properties  of Ethers
Polarity  of functional  group | The bent shape around  the oxygen  atom in an ether
means  that the two C—O dipoles  do not counteract  each
other. Because  a C—O bond is less polar than an O—H
bond, an ether is less polar than an alcohol.
Hydrogen  bonding Because  there is no O—H  bond in an ether, hydrogen
bonding  does not occur between  ether molecules.  Ethers
can accept  hydrogen  bonding  from water molecules.
Solubility  in water Ethers  are usually  soluble  in water. The solubility  of an
ether decreases  as the size of the alkyl groups  increases.
Melting  and boiling  points | The boiling  points  of ethers are much lower than the
boiling  points  of alcohols  with the same number  of
carbon  atoms.
Additional  Characteristics  of Ethers
e Like alcohols,  ethers are extremely  flammable  and should  be used
with caution.
Amines
An organic  compound  with the functional  group —NH2, —NHR,  or
—NR,; is called an amine. The letter N refers to the nitrogen  atom. The
letter R refers to an alkyl group attached  to the nitrogen.  The general
formula  of an amine is R—NR’:.  Amines  can be thought  of as derivatives
of the ammonia  molecule,  NH3. They are classified  as primary,  secondary,
or tertiary,  depending  on how many alkyl groups  are attached  to the
nitrogen  atom. Note that the meanings  of “primary,”  “seconday,”  and
“tertiary”  are slightly  different  from their meanings  for alcohols.

To name an amine,  follow  the steps below. The Sample  Problem

How to Name an Amine
Step1 Identify  the largest  hydrocarbon  group attached  to the nitrogen  atom
as the parent  alkane.
Step2 Replace  the -e at the end of the name of the parent  alkane  with
the new ending  -amine.  Include  a position  number,  if necessary,  to
show the location  of the functional  group on the hydrocarbon  chain.
Step 3 Name the other alkyl group(s)  attached  to the nitrogen  atom. Instead
of position  numbers,  use the letter N- to locate the group(s).  (If two
identical  alkyl groups  are attached  to the nitrogen  atom, use N,N-.)
This is the prefix.
Step 4 Put the name together:  prefix + root + suffix.

Amines  are polar compounds.  Primary  and secondary  amines  can form
hydrogen  bonds,  but tertiary  amines  cannot.  Table 1.8 lists some common
physical  properties  of amines.
Table 1.8 Physical  Properties  of Amines
Polarity  of functional  groupC—N  and N—H  bonds are polar. Thus, amines  are
usually  polar.
Hydrogen  bonding The presence  of one or more N—H  bonds allows
hydrogen  bonding  to take place.
Solubility  in water Because  of hydrogen  bonding,  amines  with low
molecular  masses  (four or less carbon  atoms)  are
completely  miscible  with water. The solubility
of an amine decreases  as the number  of carbon
atoms increases.
Melting  and boiling  points The boiling  points of primary  and secondary  amines
(which  contain  N—H  bonds)  are higher  than the boiling
points of tertiary  amines  (which  do not contain  an N—H
bond). The higher  boiling  points are due to hydrogen
bonding  between  amine  molecules.
Additional  Characteristics  of Amines
e Amines  are found widely  in nature.  They are often toxic. Many
amines  that are produced  by plants have medicinal  properties.
(See Figure 1.17.)
e Amines  with low molecular  masses  have a distinctive  fishy smell.
Also, many offensive  odours  of decay and decomposition  are caused
by amines.  For example,  cadavarine,  H,.NCH,CH,CH2,CH2CH2NHz2,
contributes  to the odour of decaying  flesh. This compound  gets its
common  name from the word “cadaver,”  meaning  “dead body.”
e Like ammonia,  amines  act as weak bases. Since amines  are bases,
adding  an acid to an amine produces  a salt. This explains  why
vinegar  and lemon  juice (both acids) can be used to neutralize  the
fishy smell of seafood,  which  is caused  by basic amines.

Functional  Groups
With the C—O Bond
Some of the most interesting  and useful organic  compounds  belong  to
families  you are about to encounter.  For example,  the sweet taste of
vanilla  and the spicy scent of cinnamon  have something  in common:
a carbonyl!  group. A carbonyl  group is composed  of a carbon  atom double-
bonded  to an oxygen  atom. In this section,  you will study the structures
and properties  of organic  compounds  that have the C—O group.
Aldehydes  and Ketones
Aldehydes  and ketones  both have the carbonyl  functional  group. An
aldehyde  is an organic  compound  that has a double-bonded  oxygen  on
the last carbon  of a carbon  chain. The functional  group for an aldehyde  is
|—CH
The general  formula  for an aldehyde  is R—CHO,  where  R is any alkyl
group. Figure 1.18 shows  the first two aldehydes.

formaldehyde)
Methanal  is made from methanol.  It is used to preserve  animal tissues  and
to manufacture  plastics.  Ethanal  is also used as a preservative,  and in the manufacture  of
resins and dyes.
When  the carbonyl!  group occurs  within  a hydrocarbon  chain, the
compound  is a ketone.  A ketone  is an organic  compound  that has a
double-bonded  oxygen  on any carbon  within  the carbon  chain. The
functional  group of a ketone  is
|—C  —
The general  formula  for a ketone  is RCOR’,  where R and R’ are alkyl
groups.  Figure 1.19 shows  the simplest  ketone,  propanone.
Like the other organic  compounds  you have encountered,  the names
of aldehydes  and ketones  are based on the names of the parent  alkanes.
To name an aldehyde,  follow  the steps below.
How to Name an Aldehyde
Step1 Name the parent  alkane.  Always  give the carbon  atom of the
carbonyl  group the position  number  1.
Step2 Replace  the -e at the end of the name of the parent  alkane  with -al.
The carbonyl!  group is always  given position  number  1. Therefore,
you do not need to include  a position  number  for it.
To name a ketone,  follow  the steps on the next page. The Sample  Problem
that follows  gives examples  for naming  both aldehydes  and ketones.

How to Name a Ketone
Step1 Name the parent  alkane.  Remember  that the main chain must
contain  the C=O group.
Step 2 If there is one ketone  group,  replace  the -e at the end of the name of
the parent  alkane  with -one. If there is more than one ketone  group,
keep the -e suffix and add a suffix such as -dione or -trione.
Step 3 For carbon  chains  that have more than four carbons,  a position
number  is needed  for the carbonyl  group. Number  the carbon  chain
so that the carbonyl  group has the lowest  possible  number.

soluble  in water. Aldehydes  and ketones  with a large non-polar
hydrocarbon  part are less soluble  in water.
Melting  and The boiling  points of aldehydes  and ketones  are lower
boiling points than the boiling  points of the corresponding  alcohols.  They are
higher  than the boiling  points of the corresponding  alkanes.
Additional  Characteristics  of Aldehydes  and Ketones
e In general,  aldehydes  have a strong  pungent  smell, while ketones
smell sweet. Aldehydes  with higher  molecular  masses  have a pleasant
smell. For example,  cinnamaldehyde  gives cinnamon  its spicy smell.
(See Figure 1.20.) Aldehydes  and ketones  are often used to make
perfumes.  The rose ketones  (shown  in Figure 1.21) provide  up to 90%
of the characteristic  rose odour. Perfumers  mix organic  compounds,
such as the rose ketones,  to obtain distinctive  and attractive  scents.
e Since aldehydes  and ketones  are polar, they can act as polar solvents.
Because  of the non-polar  hydrocarbon  part of their molecules,  aldehydes
and ketones  can also act as solvents  for non-polar  compounds.  For
example,  2-propanone  (common  name: acetone)  is an important  organic
solvent  in the chemical  industry.
e Table 1.10 compares  the boiling  points  of an alkane,  an alcohol,  and an
aldehyde  with the same number  of carbon  atoms. You can see that the
boiling  point of an alcohol  is much greater  than the boiling  point of an
alkane or an aldehyde.

38Infrared  Spectroscopy
How do researchers  know when they have produced
or discovered  a new compound?  How do they
analyze  the structure  of a molecule?
A technique  called infrared  (IR) spectroscopy
is valuable  in the study of organic  compounds.  This
technique  allows researchers  to determine  the kinds
of bonds and functional  groups  that are present
in a molecule.  Using a more advanced  analysis,
researchers  are even able to determine  other groups
and bonds  that are nearby.  This information,  paired
with the molecular  formula  of a compound,  helps
researchers  puzzle out the precise  structure  of an
unknown  molecule.
An infrared  spectrometer  works by shining
infrared  light through  a sample  of a compound.
Organic  molecules  absorb  light at certain  frequencies
in the range of 450 nm to 4000 nm. A sensor  on the
other side of the sample  detects  the amount  of light
that is absorbed  by the sample  at each wavelength.
When a molecule  absorbs  light at a certain
frequency,  it means  that a specific  bond is stretch-
ing, bending,  or vibrating.  The frequency  where
each bond absorbs  light energy  to stretch,  bend,
or vibrate  is very specific.  The absorption  results  in
a decrease  in intensity  of the light transmitted,  as
measured  by the sensor.  This is how an infraredspectrum  is formed  for a molecule.  The spectrum  is
as specific  to a certain molecule  as your fingerprint
is to you. The table below  shows  some typical loca-
tions for peaks on an infrared  spectrum.

The shape of the peak for each functional  group is
affected  by other groups  and atoms in the vicinity.
Examine  the spectrum  for 2-pentanone,  shown
below.  This compound  has many C —H bonds,  and
one C—O bond. The jagged  peak in the range of 3.4
Lm to 3.5 um is caused  by the various  C— H bonds
in the molecule  absorbing  light and stretching.  The
peak between  5.8 44m and 5.9 im is caused  by the
C=O bond stretching.  The peaks between  6.7 “um
and 7.7 4m represent  the C—H bonds bending.

Additional  Characteristics  of Carboxylic  Acids
¢ Carboxylic  acids often have unpleasant  odours.  For example,  butanoic
acid has the odour of stale sweat.
e The —OH group in a carboxylic  acid does not behave  like the basic
hydroxide  ion, OH. Oxygen  has a high electronegativity  (attraction
to electrons)  and there are two oxygen  atoms in the carboxylic  acid
functional  group. These electronegative  oxygen  atoms help to carry the
extra negative  charge that is caused  when  a positive  hydrogen  atom
dissociates.  This is why the hydrogen  atom in a carboxylic  acid is able
to dissociate,  and the carboxylic  acid behaves  like an acid.

Procedure
1. Before starting  the investigation,  read through
the Procedure.  Then prepare  your equipment
as follows.
(a) Make sure that all the glassware  is very
clean and dry.
(b) Prepare  a hot-water  bath. Heat about
125 mL of tap water in a 250 mL beaker
on the hot plate to 60°C. Adjust  the hot
plate so the temperature  remains  between
50°C and 60°C.
(c) Prepare  a cold-water  bath. Place about
125 mL of a mixture  of water and ice
chips in the second  250 mL beaker.
As long as there are ice chips in the
water, the temperature  of the cold-water
bath will remain  around  0°C.
(d) Place about 5 mL of distilled  water in a
small beaker  (or graduated  cylinder).  You
will use this in step 8.
(e) Set up the retort stand beside  the hot-water
bath. Use one clamp to hold the thermo-
meter in the hot-water  bath. Make sure that
the thermometer  is not touching  the walls
or the bottom  of the beaker.  Use a stopper
or wrap a piece of paper  towel around  the
thermometer  to hold the thermometer  in
place carefully  but firmly. You will use the
other clamp to steady  the micropipettes
after you fill them with reaction  mixture
and place them in the hot-water  bath.
(f) Label three pipettes  according  to each trial:
e ethanoic  acid + ethanol
e ethanoic  acid + 1-propanol
e butanoic  acid + ethanol
(g) Cut off the bulb of one of the micropip-
pettes,  halfway  along the wide part of the
bulb (see the diagram  below.)  You will use
the bulb as a cap to prevent  vapours  from
escaping  during  the reactions.
. Use the graduated  cylinder  to measure  1.0 mL
of ethanol  into the 100 mL beaker.  As you do
so, you will get a whiff  of the odour of the
alcohol.  (@GEP  Do not inhale the alcohol
vapour  directly.)  Record  your observations.
. Use the graduated  cylinder  to add 1.0 mL
of ethanoic  acid to the ethanol.  As you do so,
you will get a whiff of the odour of the acid.
(CGD  Do not inhale the acid directly.)
Record  your observations.
. Your teacher  will carefully  add 4 drops of
sulfuric  acid to the alcohol/acid  mixture.
. Suction  the mixture  up into the appropriately
labelled  micropipette.  Invert  the micropipette.
Place it, bulb down, in the hot-water  bath.
(See the diagram  below.)  Place the cap over
the tip of the pipette.  Use a clamp to hold the
pipette  in place.

. Leave the pipette  in the hot water for about
10 min to 15 min. Use the thermometer  to
monitor  the temperature  of the hot water.
The temperature  should  stay between  50°C
and 60°C.7.
10.After 10 to 15 min in the hot-water  bath, place
the pipette  in the cold-water  bath. Allow  it to
cool for about 5 min.
. Carefully  squeeze  a few drops of the product
onto a watch  glass. Mix it with a few drops
of distilled  water. To smell the odour of the
compound,  take a deep breath.  Use your hand
to wave the aroma  toward  your nose as you
breathe  out. Record  your observations  of
the aroma.
. Repeat  the procedure  for the other two trials.
(CGT  Butanoic  acid has a strong odour.
Do not attempt  to smell it.)
Note: While the first reaction  mixture  is being
heated,  you may wish to prepare  the other
mixtures  and put them in the hot-water  bath.
Working  carefully,  you should  be able to
stabilize  more than one micropipette  with
the clamp.  If you choose  to do this, make sure
that your materials  are clearly  labelled.  Also
remember  to keep a record  of the time at which
each micropipette  was introduced  to the
hot-water  bath.
Dispose  of all materials  as your teacher  directs.
Clean all glassware  thoroughly  with soap
and water.

If you have access  to

Investigation  1-A, or a similar
investigation  from a
probeware  company.Carboxylic  Acid Derivatives
The strong-smelling  compounds  you prepared  in Investigation  1-A do not
fit into any of the organic  families  you have studied  so far. According  to
their molecular  formulas,  however,  they are isomers  of carboxylic  acids.
They are esters. Because  an ester is obtained  by replacing  the — OH
group of a carboxylic  acid with a different  group, it is called a derivative
of a carboxylic  acid. Carboxylic  acids have several  important  derivatives.
In this section,  you will study two of these derivatives:  esters and amides.
Esters
An ester is an organic  compound  that has the following  functional  group:
O
R—C—O—R’
The general  formula  for an ester is RCOOR’,  where  R is a hydrogen  atom
or a hydrocarbon,  and R’ is a hydrocarbon.  You can think of an ester as
the product  of a reaction  between  a carboxylic  acid and an alcohol,  as
shown  in Figure 1.26.
O O
carboxylic  acid alcohol ester water
GFETESRET3  When heated, butanoic  acid reacts with ethanol  to produce  an ester called
ethyl butanoate.
To name an ester, you must recognize  that an ester can be thought  of as
having  two distinct  parts. The main part of the ester contains  the — COO
group. This part comes from the parent  acid. When numbering  the main
chain of a carboxylic  acid, the carbon  atom in the carboxyl]  group is always
given position  number  1. The second  part of an ester is the alkyl group.
To name an ester, follow  the steps below.
How to Name an Ester
Step1 Identify  the main part of the ester, which  contains  the C—O group.
This part comes from the parent  acid. Begin by naming  the parent
acid.
Step 2 Replace  the -oic acid ending  of the name of the parent  acid with
-oate.
Step 3 The second  part of an ester is the alkyl group that is attached  to the
oxygen  atom. Name this as you would  name any other alkyl group.
Step 4 Put the two names  together.  Note that esters are named  as two
words. (See Figure 1.27.)

Table 1.13, on the next page, describes  some of the physical  properties
of esters. As you will see, esters have different  physical  properties  than
carboxylic  acids, even though  esters and carboxylic  acids are isomers  of
each other.
Chapter  1 Classifying  Organic  Compounds»  MHR 45
Table 1.13 Physical  Properties  of Esters
Polarity  of functional  group Like carboxylic  acids, esters are usually  polar molecules.
Hydrogen  bonding Esters do not have an O—H bond. Therefore,  they cannot
form hydrogen  bonds  with other ester molecules.
Solubility  in water Esters can accept  hydrogen  bonds  from water. Therefore,
esters with very low molecular  masses  are soluble  in
water. Esters with carbon  chains  that are longer  than
three or four carbons  are not soluble  in water.
Melting  and boiling  points Because  esters cannot  form hydrogen  bonds,  they have
low boiling  points.  They are usually  volatile  liquids  at
room temperature.
Additional  Characteristics  of Esters
e Esters often have pleasant  odours  and tastes, so they are used to
produce  perfumes  and artificial  flavours.  In fact, the characteristic  tastes
and smells of many fruits come from esters. (See Figure 1.28.)
Amides
An ester can be thought  of as the combination  of a carboxylic  acid and
OA ARAN of amides.an alcohol.  Similarly,  you can think of an amide as the combination  of
a carboxylic  acid and ammonia  or an amine.  An amide is an organic
compound  that has a carbon  atom double-bonded  to an oxygen  atom and
single-bonded  to a nitrogen  atom.
Amides  have the functional  group below:
O
The general  formula  for an amide is R—CO—NRz.  R can stand for a
hydrogen  atom or an alkyl group. Figure 1.29 gives some examples

To name an amide,  follow  the steps on the next page. The Sample
Problem  that follows  illustrates  how to use these steps. Later, Table 1.14
describes  some physical  properties  of amides.
46 MHR-* Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
How to Name an Amide
Step1 Locate the part of the amide that contains  the C—O group. Name
the parent  carboxylic  acid that this part derives  from. Note: The
carbon  in the C=O group is always  given position  number  1.
Step 2 Replace  the -oic acid ending  of the name of the parent  acid with the
suffix -amide.
Step 3 Decide  whether  the compound  is a primary,  secondary,  or tertiary
amide:
e If there are two hydrogen  atoms (and no alkyl groups)  attached
to the nitrogen  atom, the compound  is a primary  amide and
needs no other prefixes.
e If there is one alkyl group attached  to the nitrogen  atom, the
compound  is a secondary  amide.  Name the alkyl group, and
give it location  letter N- to indicate  that it is bonded  to the
nitrogen  atom.
e If there are two alkyl groups,  the compound  is a tertiary  amide.
Place the alkyl groups  in alphabetical  order. Use location  letter
N- before each group to indicate  that it is bonded  to the nitrogen
atom. If the two groups  are identical,  use N,N-.
Step 4 Put the name together:  prefix + root + suffix.

Table 1.14 Physical  Properties  of Amides
Polarity  of functional  group | Because  the nitrogen  atom attracts  electrons  more
strongly  than carbon  or hydrogen  atoms,  the C—N and
N-H bonds  are polar. As a result,  the physical
properties  of amides  are similar  to the physical
properties  of carboxylic  acids.
Hydrogen  bonding Because  primary  amides  have two N—H  bonds,  they have
even stronger  hydrogen  bonds  than carboxylic  acids.
Secondary  amides  also experience  hydrogen  bonding.
Solubility  in water Amides  are soluble  in water. Their solubility  decreases
as the non-polar  hydrocarbon  part of the molecule
increases  in size.
Melting  and boiling  points =| Primary  amides  have much higher  melting  and boiling
points  than carboxylic  acids. Many simple  amides  are
solid at room temperature.
Additional  Characteristics  of Amides
e An amide called acetaminophen  is a main component  of many
painkillers.
e Urea, another  common  example  of an amide,  is made from the reaction
between  carbon  dioxide  gas, CO2, and ammonia,  NH3. Urea was the first
organic  compound  to be synthesized  in a laboratory.  It is found in the
urine of many mammals,  including  humans,  and it is used as a fertilizer.
Comparing  Physical  Properties
In this chapter,  you have learned  how to recognize  many different  types
of organic  compounds.  In the first section,  you learned  how to use polar
bonds and the shape of a molecule  to determine  its molecular  polarity.
The following  investigation  allows  you to apply what you have learned
to predict  and compare  the physical  properties  of various  organic
compounds.

Comparing  Physical  Properties
In this investigation,  you will examine  the
differences  between  molecules  that contain
different  functional  groups.  As you have learned,
the polarity  and hydrogen  bonding  abilities  of
each functional  group affect how these molecules
interact  among  themselves  and with other
molecules.  You will examine  the shape of each
molecule  and the effects of intermolecular  forces
in detail to make predictions  about properties.
Prediction
How can you predict  the physical  properties  of
an organic  compound  by examining  its structure?
Materials
molecular  model kit
Procedure
1. Choose  a parent  alkane  that has four to ten
carbon  atoms (butane  to decane).
2. By adding  functional  groups  to your parent
alkane,  build a model of a molecule  from each
class of organic  compounds:
e aromatic  hydrocarbons  (section  1.2)
e alcohols,  ethers,  amines  (section  1.3)
e aldehydes,  ketones,  carboxylic  acids, esters,
amides  (section  1.4)
3. Draw a condensed  structural  diagram  and  a line
structural  diagram  of each compound.  Include
the IUPAC  name of the compound.
Analysis
1. Look at your aromatic  hydrocarbon,  your
alcohol,  your ether, and your carboxylic  acid.
Rank these compounds  from
e least polar to most polar
e lowest  to highest  boiling  point
Record  your rankings,  and explain  them.. Compare  the alcohol  you made with an
alcohol  that has a different  number  of carbon
atoms,  made by a classmate.  Which  alcohol
is more soluble  in water, yours or your
classmate’s?  Which  alcohol  is more polar?
Explain  your reasoning.
. Choose  two of your compounds  at random.
Which  compound  do you think has the higher
melting  point?  Explain  your reasoning.
. Consider  all the compounds  you made. Which
compound  do you think is the most soluble  in
water?  Explain  your reasoning.
. Which  compound  do you think is the most
soluble  in benzene?  Explain  your reasoning.
. Where  possible,  predict  the odour of each
organic  compound  you made.
Conclusions
7. Look up the boiling  point, melting  point,
and solubility  of each compound  in  a refer-
ence book, such as The CRC Handbook
of Chemistry  and Physics.  Compare  your
findings  with the predictions  you made in
the Analysis.
. Challenge  a classmate  to name each com-
pound  you made and identify  its functional
group.
Application
9. Use reference  books and the Internet  to
discover  any useful applications  of the
compounds  you made. Prepare  a short report
for your class, explaining  how you think each
compound’s  physical  properties  may affect its
usefulness  in real life.

activity  to practise  naming
functional  groups.Section  Summary
In this chapter,  you learned  how to recognize,  name, and predict  the
physical  properties  of organic  compounds  that belong  to the alcohol,
ether, amine,  aldehyde,  ketone,  carboxylic  acid, ester, and amide families.
You discovered  many important  uses for organic  compounds.  You know
that 2-propanol  (isopropyl!  alcohol)  is used as an antiseptic.  Acetone
(a ketone)  is the main component  of nail polish  remover.  Esters give many
fruits and processed  foods their distinctive  odours  and tastes. In the next
chapter,  you will learn about different  chemical  reactions  that are typical
of each functional  family. You will take a detailed  look at some common
organic  compounds  in your life, and learn about some of the benefits  and
risks of using organic  compounds.

TAXOLTMReactions  of Organic
Compounds
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. It is a disease in
which cells mutate  and grow at uncontrolled  rates, disrupting  the body’s
normal  functions.  TAXOLTM,  shown  at the bottom  of the page, is an organic
compound  that is found in the bark of the Pacific  yew tree. After many tests
and reviews,  TAXOLTM  was approved  for use in treating  ovarian  cancer.
The bark of a large yew tree yields only enough  TAXOLTM  for a single
treatment.  However,  cancer  patients  require  repeated  treatments  over a
long period of time. Working  in a laboratory,  chemists  found the first
solution  to this problem.  They developed  several  different  methods  to
make, or synthesize,  TAXOLTM,  from simple,  widely  available  chemicals.
Unfortunately,  these methods  are expensive  and time-consuming.
When studying  the Pacific  yew’s close relative,  the European  yew,
chemists  made an exciting  discovery  that led to the second  solution.
The needles  and twigs of the European  yew contain  10-deacetylbaccatin
III, shown  at the bottom  of the page. A few reaction  steps can transform
10-deacetylbaccatin  II into TAXOLTM.  Instead  of destroying  an entire
Pacific  yew tree for a single treatment  of TAXOLTM,  scientists  can now
use the needles  from a European  yew. The parent  tree is not harmed.
As you have already  learned,  the study of organic  chemistry  is really
the study of functional  groups.  Each functional  group undergoes  specific,
predictable  reactions.  Chemists  used their knowledge  of functional  groups
to design  the reactions  that convert  10-deacetylbaccatin  III into TAXOLTM.
In this chapter,  you will learn how to predict  the products  of various
organic  reactions,  such as addition,  substitution,  and elimination  reactions.

The Main Types
of Organic  Reactions
Figure 2.1(A) shows  raw fruit. The crisp, sharp-tasting  fruit becomes  soft
and sweet when it is cooked.  Figure 2.1(B) shows a chemist  accelerating
the tranformation  of ethanol  into ethanoic  acid, by adding  potassium
dichromate  and sulfuric  acid.
What do these reactions  have in common?  They are both examples  of
organic  reactions.  In this section,  you will take a quick look at the main
types of organic  reactions.  You will concentrate  on simply  recognizing
these types of organic  reactions.  In the next section,  you will examine  the
reactions  of specific  functional  groups  and learn how to predict  the prod-
ucts of organic  reactions.
(GETEEEAT  Organic  reactions  take place all around you, not only in a science  lab.
Addition,  Substitution,  and Elimination  Reactions
Addition  reactions,  substitution  reactions,  and elimination  reactions  are
the three main types of organic  reactions.  Most organic  reactions  can be
classified  as one of these three types.
Addition  Reactions
In an addition  reaction,  atoms are added  to a double  or triple bond. One
bond of the multiple  bond breaks so that two new bonds can form. To
recognize  an addition  reaction,  remember  that two compounds  usually
react to form one major product.  (Sometimes  two isomers  are formed.)
The product  has more atoms bonded  to carbon  atoms than the organic
reactant  did. A general  example  of addition  to an alkene  is given below.
xX Y
—CH==CH—  + XY ~ —CH—CH—
Addition  reactions  are common  for alkenes  and alkynes.  Addition
reactions  can also occur at a C=O bond. Some examples  of addition
reactions  are shown  on the next page.2.1
In this section,  you will

organic  reactions,  including

Chapter  2 Reactions  of Organic  Compounds  * MHR_- 457
CONCEPT  CHECK
You can express  an addition
reaction  algebraically,  using
the equation a+ b — ab.
Come up with similar
equations  for substitution
and elimination  reactions.Example  1
H H Br HNe | |C=C + HBr > H—C—C—H\
ethene hydrobromic  acid bromoethane
Example  2 Br Br
butyne bromine 1,2-dibromobutene
Substitution  Reactions
In a substitution  reaction,  a hydrogen  atom or a functional  group is
replaced  by a different  functional  group. To help you recognize  this
type of reaction,  remember  that two compounds  usually  react to form
two different  products.  The organic  reactant(s)  and the organic  product(s)
have the same number  of atoms bonded  to carbon.
—C—xX + AY ~ —C—Y + AX
Alcohols,  alkyl halides,  and aromatic  compounds  commonly  undergo
substitution  reactions,  as shown  in these examples.

Elimination  Reactions
In an elimination  reaction,  atoms are removed  from a molecule  to form a
double  bond. This type of reaction  is the reverse  of an addition  reaction.
One reactant  usually  breaks  up to give two products.  The organic  product
typically  has fewer atoms bonded  to carbon  atoms than the organic
reactant  did.
Alcohols  often undergo  elimination  reactions  when they are heated  in
the presence  of strong acids, such as sulfuric  acid, H2SO,,  which  acts
as a Catalyst.  (See the first example  below.)  Alkyl halides  also undergo
elimination  reactions  to produce  alkenes.  (See the second  example.)

Oxidation  and Reduction
An important  type of organic  reaction  occurs  when there is a change  in
the number  of hydrogen  or oxygen  atoms that are bonded  to carbon.  In
Unit 5, you will take a close look at oxidation-reduction  reactions  in terms
of the transfer  of electrons.  As you will learn, oxidation  and reduction
always  occur together.  One reactant  is oxidized  while the other reactant
is reduced.  In this unit, however,  you will focus on the organic  reactant
only. Therefore,  you will deal with oxidation  and reduction  separately,  as
they apply to organic  compounds.  In organic  chemistry,  oxidation  and
reduction  are defined  by the changes  of the bonds to carbon  atoms in the
organic  reactant.CONCEPT  CHECK
In the first example  of an
elimination  reaction,  the strong
acid, H»SOxz, does not count
as a reactant.  It is not directly
involved  in the reaction.  It is
a catalyst: a compound  that
speeds  up a reaction  but is not
consumed  by it.
Chapter  2 Reactions  of Organic  Compounds»  MHR_- 459
60Oxidation
In organic  chemistry,  oxidation  is defined  as a reaction  in which  a carbon
atom forms more bonds to oxygen,  O, or less bonds to hydrogen,  H. An
oxidation  that involves  the formation  of double C—O bonds may also be
classified  as an elimination  reaction.
For example,  alcohols  can be oxidized  to produce  aldehydes  and
ketones.  Oxidation  occurs  when an organic  compound  reacts with an
oxidizing  agent. Common  oxidizing  agents include  acidified  potassium
permanganate,  KMnOg,,  acidified  potassium  dichromate,  K,Cr,07,  and
ozone, O3. The symbol  [O] is used to symbolize  an oxidizing  agent, as
shown  below. Note that equations  for the oxidation  of organic  compounds
are often left unbalanced.  The purpose  of the equation  is to show the
changes  in the organic  reactant  only.

To identify  an oxidation,  count and compare  the number  of C—H
and C—O bonds in both the reactant  and product.  Try it for the
following  example.
H OH H O

Reduction
In organic  chemistry,  reduction  is defined  as a reaction  in which  a
carbon  atom forms fewer bonds to oxygen,  O, or more bonds to hydrogen,
H. Often, a C=O bond or C=C bond is reduced  to a single bond by
reduction.  A reduction  that transforms  double  C=C or C=O bonds to
single bonds may also be classified  as an addition  reaction.  Aldehydes,
ketones,  and carboxylic  acids can be reduced  to become  alcohols.  Alkenes
and alkynes  can be reduced  by the addition  of Hz to become  alkanes.
Reduction  occurs  when an organic  compound  reacts with a reducing
agent. Common  reducing  agents are lithium  aluminum  hydride,  LiAlH,z,
and hydrogen  gas over a platinum  catalyst,  H,/Pt. The symbol  [H] is used
to symbolize  a reducing  agent. As is the case for oxidation,  equations
showing  the reduction  of organic  compounds  are often left unbalanced.

Hydrolysis  Reactions
In a hydrolysis  reaction,  water adds to a bond, splitting  it in two. This
reaction  is the reverse  of a condensation  reaction.  For example,  water
can add to an ester or amide  bond. A carboxylic  acid and an alcohol  are
produced  if an ester bond is hydrolyzed,  as shown  in the example  below.

(c) CH3sCH(CH3)CH2CH2Br  + NaOH — CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH20H  + NaBr
Solution
(a) A double  bond is formed.  One reactant  becomes  two products.
The organic  product  has fewer atoms bonded  to carbon.  Thus,
this reaction  is an elimination  reaction.
(b) A double  bond becomes  a single bond. Two reactants  become  one
product.  The organic  product  has more atoms bonded  to carbon.
Thus, this reaction  is an addition  reaction.
(c) No double  bond is broken  or formed.  Two reactants  form two
products.  An atom in the organic  reactant  (Br) is replaced  by a
different  group of atoms (OH). Thus, this is a substitution  reaction.

In this section,  you will learn how to predict  the reactions  of different
functional  groups.  You studied  the most common  reaction  of alkanes,
combustion,  in your previous  chemistry  course.  For this reason,  the
reactions  of alkanes  will not be considered  here. The reactions  of amines
and ethers will be left for a later chemistry  course.
Reactions  of Alkenes  and Alkynes
Because  alkenes  and alkynes  have reactive  double  or triple bonds,  they
undergo  addition  reactions.  Some common  atoms and groups  of atoms
that can be added to a double  or triple bond include
e H and OH (from H,0)
e H and X (from HX), where X = Cl, Br, or I
e X and X (from X2), where X = Cl, Br, or I
e H and H (from Hz.)
Depending  on which  atoms are added  to the multiple  bond, the product
may be an alcohol,  alkyl halide,  alkane,  or alkene (if atoms are added  to a
triple bond).
Chapter  2 Reactions  of Organic  Compounds  * MHR-_ 65
66Addition  to Alkenes
The product  of an addition  reaction  depends  on the symmetry  of the
reactants.  A symmetrical  alkene  has identical  groups  on either side of the
double  bond. Ethene,  CH,  CH2, is an example  of a symmetrical  alkene.
An alkene  that has different  groups  on either side of the double  bond is
called an asymmetrical  alkene.  Propene,  CH; CH=  CHag, is an example  of
an asymmetrical  alkene.
The molecules  that are added to a multiple  bond can also be classified
as symmetrical  or asymmetrical.  For example,  chlorine,  Cl,, breaks  into
two identical  parts when it adds to a multiple  bond. Therefore,  it is a
symmetrical  reactant.  Water,  HOH, breaks  into two different  groups  (H and
OH) when it adds to a multiple  bond, so it is an asymmetrical  reactant.
In Figures  2.3 and 2.4, at least one of the reactants  is symmetrical.
When one or more reactants  in an addition  reaction  are symmetrical,  only
one product  is possible.

When  both reactants  are asymmetrical,  however,  more than one product
is possible.  This is shown  in Figure 2.5. The two possible  products  are
isomers  of each other.

GETEAEZY  The addition  of hydrobromic  acid to 1-butene
Although  both products  are possible,  2-bromobutane  is the observed
product.  This observation  is explained  by Markovnikov’s  rule.
Markovnikov’s  rule states that the halogen  atom or OH group  in an addition
reaction  is usually  added  to the more substituted  carbon  atom—the  carbon
atom that is bonded  to the largest  number  of other carbon  atoms.  Think  of
the phrase  “the rich get richer.”  The carbon  with the most hydrogen  atoms
receives  even more hydrogen  atoms in an addition  reaction.  According
to Markovnikov’s  rule, the addition  of two asymmetrical  reactants  forms
primarily  one product.  Only a small amount  of the other isomer  is formed.
The following  Sample  Problem  shows  how to use Markovnikov’s  rule to
predict  the products  of addition  reactions.

Use Markovnikov’s  rule to predict  which  of the two isomeric  products

Solution
According  to Markovnikov’s  rule, the hydrogen  atom will go to the
double-bonded  carbon  with the larger  number  of hydrogen  atoms.
Thus, the chlorine  atom will go to the other carbon,  which  has the larger
number  of C—C bonds.  The product  2-chloro-2-methylpentane  will
form in the greater  amount.  Small amounts  of 3-chloro-2-methylpentane

Dusanka  Filipovic
When Dusanka  Filipovic  was a teenager,  she liked
hiking,  playing  volleyball,  and working  as a camp
counsellor.  Now she is a successful  chemical
engineer  who develops  and markets  technology
that helps the environment.  What do her early
pursuits  have to do with her engineering  career?
“Both require  creativity,  persistence,  and an ability
to work under pressure,”  says Filipovic.
Filipovic  was born and grew up in Belgrade,  in
the former  Yugoslavia.  She attended  the University
of Belgrade,  and graduated  with a degree  in
chemical  engineering.  Attracted  by Canada’s
technical  advances,  she came here after winning
a scholarship  to study at McMaster  University  in
Hamilton,  Ontario.  Canada  has become  her home.
Filipovic  has worked  hard to break down barriers
for women  in the fields of engineering  and business.
In 1974, she became  the first female  professional
engineer  employed  by a major  chemical  producing
company.  The National  Museum  of Science  and
Technology  in Ottawa,  Ontario,  has featured  her
work as part of an exhibit  on women  inventors.
Since the 1980s, Filipovic  has concentrated  on
developing  environmentally  friendly  technologies.
She is the co-inventor  of a patented  process  known
as Blue BottleTM  technology.  This process  is usedto recover  and recycle  halogenated  hydrocarbons,
such as chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) and other
ozone-depleting  substances  (ODS),  from damaged
or unused  residential  refrigerators  and automotive
air conditioners.
Using adsorption,  the binding  of molecules  or
particles  to a surface,  Blue BottleTM  technology  acts
as a selective  molecular  sieve to capture  refrigerant
gases so that they can be safely stored and re-used.
A non-pressurized  Blue BottleTM  cylinder,  packed
with an adsorbent,  synthetic  zeolite  called
HaloziteTM,  is connected  to the back of a refrigera-
tion or air-conditioning  unit. Zeolites  are porous
aluminosilicate  minerals  that commonly  contain
sodium  and calcium  as major cations  (positively
charged  ions) and are capable  of ion exchange.
(Zeolites  contain  water molecules  that allow
reversible  dehydration,  and they are often used
as water softeners.)  The HaloziteTM  adsorbs  the
refrigerants  that are released  from the unit at
ambient  temperatures,  under atmospheric  pressure.
Once the adsorbent  is saturated,  the Blue
BottleTM  cylinder  is sent to a central reclamation
facility,  where  the refrigerants  are reclaimed  and
stored.  The Blue BottleTM  cylinders  can be re-used
after the refrigerants  have been collected.
Reclaimed  halogenated  hydrocarbons  can be used
as refrigerants,  solvents,  cleaners,  fumigants,  and
fire retardants.
In 1991, Filipovic  formed  her own company  to
commercialize  Blue BottleTM  technology.  In 1999,
she founded  a new company,  which uses a process
similar  to Blue BottleTM  technology  to capture  and
convert  greenhouse  gas emissions  from hospital
operating  rooms.  These emissions  had previously
been discharged  into the atmosphere.
Filipovic  has this advice  for aspiring  engineers
and scientists:  “Once you recognize  what it is you
want to pursue,  make sure you take advantage  of
every training  opportunity  offered  to you. | became

As you learned  in Chapter  1, aromatic  compounds  do not react in the
same way that compounds  with double  or triple bonds do. Benzene’s
stable ring does not usually  accept  the addition  of other atoms. Instead,
aromatic  compounds  undergo  substitution  reactions.  A hydrogen  atom
or a functional  group that is attached  to the benzene  ring may be replaced
by a different  functional  group. Figure 2.6 shows two possible  reactions
for benzene.  Notice that iron(III)  bromide,  FeBr3, is used as a catalyst  in
the substitution  reaction.  An addition  reaction  does not occur because  the
product  of this reaction  would  be less stable than benzene.

Reactions  of Alcohols
Alcohols  can react in several  ways, depending  on the reactants  and on the
conditions  of the reaction.  For example,  alcohols  can undergo  substitution
with halogen  acids, elimination  to form alkenes,  and oxidation  to form
aldehydes,  ketones,  or carboxylic  acids.
Substitution  Reactions  of Alcohols
When a halogen  acid, such as HCl, HBr, or HI, reacts with an alcohol,
the halogen  atom is substituted  for the OH group of the alcohol.  This is
shown  in Figure 2.7(A). The reverse  reaction  takes place when an alkyl
halide reacts with OH” in a basic solution.  See Figure 2.7(B).
A CH;—CH,—OH  + HCl — CH3;—CH.,—Cl  + H,O
B CH;—CH,—Cl  + OH- — CH3;—CH,—OH  + Cr
(A) Ethanol reacts with hydrochloric  acid to produce  chloroethane.  (B) Ina
basic solution,  the reverse  reaction  takes place. A hydroxide  ion reacts  with chloroethane
to produce  ethanol.
Elimination  Reactions  of Alcohols
When an alcohol  is heated  in the presence  of the strong acid and
dehydrating  agent, H,SO,,  an elimination  reaction  takes place. This type
of reaction  is shown  in Figure 2.8, on the next page. The OH group and
one H atom leave the molecule,  and water is produced.  As a result, the
molecule  forms a double  bond. Because  water is produced,  this type of
reaction  is also called a dehydration  (meaning  “loss of water’)  reaction.

(a) The reactant  is a secondary  alcohol,  and an oxidizing  agent is present.
Therefore,  this must be oxidation.  You know that a secondary  alcohol
is oxidized  to a ketone. The ketone must have the same carbon-carbon
bonds, and the same number  of carbon atoms, as the reacting  alcohol.
Therefore,  the ketone  must be 2-butanone.

the same number  of carbon atoms as the reacting  alcohol.  Since this
reaction  is an elimination  reaction,  a small molecule  (in this case,
water) must be eliminated  as the second  product.  The organic

Reactions  of Aldehydes  and Ketones
As you observed  in the investigation,  different  alcohols  react differently
with an oxidizing  agent. In the same way, aldehydes  and ketones  react
differently  with oxidizing  and reducing  agents, even though  aldehydes
and ketones  have similar  structures.
Oxidation  of Aldehydes
In the presence  of an oxidizing  agent, an aldehyde  is oxidized  to produce
a carboxylic  acid. The hydrogen  atom that is bonded  to the carbon  atom
of the C=O bond is replaced  with an OH group.
O O

Ketones  do not usually  undergo  oxidation.  Like tertiary  alcohols,

Reduction  of Aldehydes  and Ketones
You learned  earlier  that primary  alcohols  are oxidized  to aldehydes,  and
secondary  alcohols  are oxidized  to ketones.  You can think of the reduc-
tion of aldehydes  and ketones  as the reverse  of these reactions.  Aldehydes
can be reduced  to produce  primary  alcohols.  Ketones  can be reduced  to
produce  secondary  alcohols.

Reactions  of Carboxylic  Acids
Like other acids, a carboxylic  acid reacts with a base to produce  a salt
and water.

(acid) hydroxide  (base) (salt)
As you learned  earlier,  a carboxylic  acid reacts with an alcohol  to produce
an ester. Water is the second  product  of this reaction.  A strong acid, such
as H2SOu,  is used to catalyze  (speed  up) the reaction.  The reverse  reaction
can also occur. (See “Reactions  of Esters and Amides,”  below.)

H,SO, |R—C—OH  + HO—R =~ R—-C—O—R  + HO
carboxylic  acid alcohol ester water
The reaction  of a carboxylic  acid with an alcohol  to form an ester is
called an esterification  reaction.  An esterification  reaction  is one type of
condensation  reaction.  In a similar  type of condensation  reaction,  an
amide can be formed  from a carboxylic  acid and an amine,  but this
process  is slightly  longer  and will not be discussed  here.
Carboxylic  acids can be reduced  to form aldehydes  and alcohols.
Reactions  of Esters and Amides
Both esters and amides  undergo  hydrolysis  reactions.  In a hydrolysis
reaction,  the ester or amide bond is cleaved,  or split in two, to form two
products.  As mentioned  earlier,  the hydrolysis  of an ester produces  a
carboxylic  acid and an alcohol.  The hydrolysis  of an amide produces  a
carboxylic  acid and an amine. There are two methods  of hydrolysis:  acidic
hydrolysis  and basic hydrolysis.  Both methods  are shown  in Figure 2.9.
Hydrolysis  usually  requires  heat. In acidic hydrolysis,  the ester or amide
reacts with water in the presence  of an acid, such as H2SQOkg.  In basic
hydrolysis,  the ester or amide reacts with the OH” ion, from NaOH or
water, in the presence  of a base. Soap is made by the basic hydrolysis  of
ester bonds in vegetable  oils or animal  fats.

Making  Synthetic  Polymers:
Addition  and Condensation  Polymerization
Synthetic  polymers  are extremely  useful and valuable.  Many polymers
and their manufacturing  processes  have been patented  as corporate
technology.  Polymers  form by two of the reactions  you have already
learned:  addition  reactions  and condensation  reactions.
The name of a polymer  is usually  written  with the prefix poly-
(meaning  “many”)  before  the name of the monomer.  Often the common
name of the monomer  is used, rather  than the IUPAC  name. For example,
the common  name of ethene  is ethylene.  Polyethene,  the polymer
that is made from ethene,  is often called polyethylene.  Similarly,
the polymer  that is made from chloroethene  (common  name: vinyl
chloride)  is named  polyvinylchloride  (PVC). The polymer  that is made
from propene  monomers  (common  name: propylene)  is commonly  called
polypropylene,  instead  of polypropene.
Addition  polymerization  is a reaction  in which  monomers  with
double  bonds are joined  together  through  multiple  addition  reactions
to form a polymer.  Figure 2.12 illustrates  the addition  polymerization
reaction  of ethene  to form polyethene.  Table 2.1, on the next page, gives
the names,  structures,  and uses of some common  polymers  that are
formed  by addition  polymerization.

Condensation  polymerization  is a reaction  in which  monomers  are joined
together  by the formation  of ester or amide bonds.  A second  smaller
product,  usually  water, is produced  by this reaction.  For condensation
polymerization  to occur, each monomer  must have two functional  groups
(usually  one at each end of the molecule).
Nylon-66  is made by the condensation  polymerization  of the
dicarboxylic  acid adipic acid, and 1,6-diaminohexane,  an amine. (The
number  66 comes from the fact that each of the two reactants  contains  six
carbon  atoms.)  This reaction  results  in the formation  of amide  bonds
between  monomers,  as shown  in Figure 2.13. Condensation  polymers
that contain  amide  bonds are called nylons  or polyamides.  Condensation
polymers  that contain  ester bonds are called polyesters.  Polyesters  result
from the esterification  of diacids  and dialcohols.een  eee  eeeElectronic  Learning  Partner

the three-dimensional  structure  of the polymer.
When placed  in distilled  water, the concentration
of sodium  ions inside the polymer  is much
greater  than the concentration  of sodium
ions outside  the polymer.  The concentration
imbalance  causes  water molecules  to move
by diffusion  into the polymer.  As a result,  the
polymer  absorbs  many times its own mass in
distilled  water.

Procedure
Part 1 Examination  of a Water-Absorbent
Polymer
1. Examine  the sodium  polyacrylate  powder.
Record  your observations.
2. Record  the mass of a dry, empty 500 mL

88Risks of the Polymer  Industry
In the 1970s, workers  at an American  plastics  manufacturing  plant
began  to experience  serious  illnesses.  Several  workers  died of liver
cancer  before  the problem  was traced  to its source:  prolonged  exposure
to vinyl chloride.  Vinyl chloride  (or chloroethene,  C,H;Cl)  is used to
make polyvinylchloride  (PVC). Unfortunately,  vinyl chloride  is a
powerful  carcinogen.  Government  regulations  have now restricted
workers’  exposure  to vinyl chloride.  Trace amounts  of this dangerous
chemical  are still present,  however,  as pollution  in the environment.
The manufacture  and disposal  of PVC creates  another  serious
problem.  Dioxin,  shown  in Figure  2.14, is a highly  toxic chemical.  It is
produced  during  the manufacture  and burning  of PVC plastics.
Cl O Cl
TOL JOCCl O Cl
GETTEEATY  Dioxin has been shown to be extremely  carcinogenic  to some animals.  As
well, it is suspected  of disrupting  hormone  activity  in the body, leading  to reduced  fertility
and birth defects.
Many synthetic  polymers,  including  most plastics,  do not degrade  in the
environment.  What can be done with plastic  and other polymer  waste?
One solution  may be the development  and use of degradable  plastics.
These are polymers  that break down over time when exposed  to
environmental  conditions,  such as light and bacteria.  The Chemistry
Bulletin  on the next page gives more information  about degradable  plastics.
Natural  Polymers
Much of our technology  has been developed  by observing  and imitating
the natural  world. Synthetic  polymers,  such as those you just encoun-
tered, were developed  by imitating  natural  polymers.  For example,  the
natural  polymer  cellulose  provides  most of the structure  of plants.  Wood,
paper, cotton,  and flax, are all composed  of cellulose  fibres. Figure 2.15
shows part of a cellulose  polymer.

Biochemistry  is the study of the organic  compounds  and reactions
that occur in living things.  Proteins,  starches,  and nucleic  acids are

Degradable  Plastics:
Garbage  That Takes Itself Out
Did you know that the first plastics  were consid-
ered too valuable  to be thrown  out? Today, many
plastics  are considered  disposable.  Plastics  now
take up nearly one third of all landfill space, and
society’s  use of plastics  is on the rise. Recycling
initiatives  are helping  to reduce  plastic  waste.
Another  solution  to this problem  may involve  the
technology  of degradable  plastics.
All plastics  are polymers,  long molecules
made of repeating  units. Because  polymers
are extremely  stable,  they resist reaction.  Most
conventional  plastics  require  hundreds  or even
thousands  of years to break down.
Degradable  plastics  are an important  step
forward  in technology.  These new plastics  can
break down in a relatively  short time—within  six
months  to a year. There are two main kinds of
degradable  plastics:  biodegradable  plastics  and
photodegradable  plastics.  Biodegradable  plastics
are susceptible  to decay processes  that are similar
to the decay processes  of natural  objects,  such as
plants. Photodegradable  plastics  disintegrate  when
they are exposed  to certain  wavelengths  of light.
The ability  of a degradable  plastic  to decay
depends  on the structure  of its polymer  chain.
Biodegradable  plastics  are often manufactured
from natural polymers,  such as cornstarch  and
wheat gluten.  Micro-organisms  in the soil can
break down these natural  polymers.  Ideally,
a biodegradable  plastic  would break down com-
pletely  into carbon  dioxide,  water, and biomass
within six months,  just like a natural  material.
Photodegradable  plastic is a Canadian
contribution  to the environmental  health of the
planet. It was developed  in Canada  more than 25
years ago by Dr. James  Guillet,  of the University  of
Toronto.  This plastic  incorporates  light-absorbing,
or chromomorphic,  molecular  groups  as part of its
backbone  chain. The chromomorphic  groups
change  their structure  when they are exposed  to
particular  frequencies  of light (usually  ultraviolet).
The structural  changes  in these groups  cause
the backbone  to break apart. Although  the
photodegradable  process  is not very effectiveSociety J Environment
at the bottom  of a landfill,  it is ideally  suited  to
the marine  environment.  Plastics  that are discarded
in oceans  and lakes usually  float at the surface,
and thus are exposed  to light. The rings that
are used to package  canned  drinks can strangle
marine  wildlife.  These rings are now made with
photodegradable  technology  in many countries.
Several  nations  are conducting  further  research
into other marine  uses for this technology.
Making  Connections
1. When a degradable  plastic  decays,  the starch or
cellulose  backbone  may break down completely
into carbon  dioxide,  water, and organic  matter.
What do you think happens  to F, Cl, or other
heteroatom  groups  on the polymer  chain as
the backbone  decays?  Why might this be a
problem?
2. Several  notable  scientists  have cautioned
against  the use of biodegradable  and photo-
degradable  plastics  in landfills.  The bottom
of a landfill has no light, or oxygen  for the
metabolism  of bacteria.  Why is this a problem?
What changes  must be made to landfill design,
if biodegradable  and photodegradable  plastics
are going to be included  in landfills?
3. Do degradable  plastics  disappear  as soon as
they are discarded?  What are the dangers
of public  confidence  in the degradability  of
plastics?

A protein  is a natural  polymer  that is composed  of monomers  called
amino acids. Proteins  are found in meat, milk, eggs, and legumes.
Wool, leather,  and silk are natural  materials  that are made of proteins.
Your fingernails,  hair, and skin are composed  of different  proteins.
Proteins  carry out many important  functions  in your body, such as
speeding  up chemical  reactions  (enzymes),  transporting  oxygen  in your
blood (hemoglobin),  and regulating  your body responses  (hormones).
There are 20 common  amino acids in the human  body. All amino
acids contain  a carboxylic  acid group and an amino group. Amino  acids
can be linked  by amide bonds to form proteins.  Each amino acid has a
different  side chain, which  is attached  to the centre carbon  atom. Figure
2.16, below, shows the structure  of an amino acid. The letter G represents
the side chain of the amino acid. Examples  of side chains  include  —CH,
(for the amino  acid alanine),  —CH,CH,CONH,  (for glutamine),  and
—CH,OH  (for serine).
H O
H,N—  C—C—OH
G
| Figure 2.16 | The structure  of an amino acid
The shape and biological  function  of a protein  depends  on its sequence  of
amino acids. A typical  protein,  such as insulin,  contains  at least 50 amino
acid groups.  Depending  on the sequence  of these amino acids, an infinite
number  of different  proteins  are possible.  Each species  of animal  has its
own distinct  proteins.  The DNA in your body contains  the blueprints  for
making  specific  proteins  for your body’s structure  and function.
Carbohydrates
A carbohydrate  (also called a saccharide)  is a biological  molecule  that
contains  either an aldehyde  or ketone  group, along with two or more
hydroxyl  groups.  The C=O group at one end of a simple  saccharide
reacts with an OH group at the other end to produce  the most common
formation,  a ring. Figure 2.17 shows the ring forms of some of the
simplest  carbohydrates.

Glucose  is the simplest  carbohydrate.  It is found in grapes
and corn syrup. Fructose  gives fruit its sweet  taste. A condensation  reaction
between  glucose  and fructose  produces  sucrose,  commonly  called table OH
sugar. Sucrose  is found in sugar cane and sugar beets.
90 = MHR- Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
Carbohydrates  are found in foods such as bread, pasta, potatoes,  and
fruits. They are the primary  source  of energy  for the body. In a process
called cellular  respiration,  carbohydrates  combine  with inhaled  oxygen
and are oxidized  to produce  carbon  dioxide  and water, plus energy.  As
shown  in Figure 2.18, carbon  dioxide  and water vapour  from cellular
respiration  are expelled  in your breath.
On a cold day, the water vapour  in your breath condenses  on contact
with the air, forming  a visible  cloud.
A monosaccharide  is composed  of one saccharide  unit. Thus, it is the
smallest  molecule  possible  for a carbohydrate.  A monosaccharide  is often
called a simple  carbohydrate,  or simple  sugar. Glucose,  seen in Figure 2.17,
on the previous  page, is one example  of a monosaccharide.  Other mono-
saccharides  include  fructose,  galactose,  and mannose.
Sucrose  (shown  in Figure 2.17) is a disaccharide,  containing  two
saccharide  monomers.  To produce  a disaccharide,  an —OH  group on
one monomer  reacts with an —OH  group on another  monomer  to form
an ether — O— linkage  (also shown  in Figure 2.17). This reaction  is a
condensation,  because  two molecules  combine  and produce  a molecule
of water. During  digestion,  carbohydrates  undergo  hydrolysis  reactions,
which  break the ether bonds  between  the monomers.
Polysaccharides  are polymers  that contain  many saccharide  units.
The most important  polysaccharides  are those in which  glucose  is the
monomer.  Plants  use the glucose  polysaccharide  cellulose  as a structural
material.  (See Figure 2.15 for the structure  of cellulose.)  They store
energy  in the starches  amylose  and amylopectin.  A starch  is a glucose
polysaccharide  that is used by plants to store energy.  Humans  can digest
starches.  Animals  store energy  in the glucose  polysaccharide  glycogen,
illustrated  in Figure 2.19
GETISEZEY  Glycogen  is the major storage
polysaccharide  in animals.  This tiny portion  of a
tangled  glycogen  granule  shows  the highly
branched  polymer,  made of glucose  units.COURSE

92Nucleotides  and Nucleic  Acids
Humans  and cats both begin life as fertilized  eggs, which  look fairly
similar.  Why does  a fertilized  cat egg develop  into a kitten,  while a
fertilized  human  egg develops  into a child (Figure  2.20)? A very special
type of polymer,  located  in the cell nucleus,  directs  the formation  of the
proteins  from which  an organism  develops.
(GEETSEZT)  DNA in the cells of your body direct the production  of proteins.  Since your
bones, muscles,  and organs  are built from proteins  that are specific  to humans,  your body
is different  from the body of a cat.
DNA (short for 2-deoxyribonucleic  acid) is the biological  molecule  that
determines  the shape and structure  of all organisms.  It is found mostly
in the nuclei of cells. Each strand of DNA is a polymer  that is composed
of repeating  units, called nucleotides.  A single strand of DNA may have
more than one million  nucleotides.  Each nucleotide  consists  of three
parts: a sugar, a phosphate  group, and a base.
DNA is one type of nucleic  acid. The other type of nucleic  acid is
called RNA (short for ribonucleic  acid). RNA is present  throughout  a cell.
It works closely  with DNA to produce  the proteins  in the body. Table 2.3,
on the next page, shows  the structures  of RNA and DNA.

GPETIAEZ27  Two strands  of DNA
are held together  by hydrogen  bonds
to form a double-helix  molecule.
(GGETTEEZ7  Afat or an oil is
produced  when three long-chain
carboxylic  acids, called fatty acids,
bond with a glycerol  unit to form
three ester bonds. (Note that the
three fatty acids are not always
identical.)  A hydrolysis  reaction
can split these three ester bonds to
produce  glycerol  and a combina-
tion of the salts of fatty acids, better
known  as soap.A complete  molecule  of DNA consists  of two complementary  strands.
These strands  are held together  by hydrogen  bonds  between  the bases
on the nucleotide  units, as shown  in Figure 2.21.
DNA has two main functions  in the body:
e It replicates  itself exactly  whenever  a cell divides.  Thus, every cell in
an organism  contains  the same information.
e It contains  codes that allow each type of protein  that is needed  by the
body to be made by the body’s cells. RNA assists in this process.
Lipids
The last biological  molecules  that you will examine  in this course are
not polymers.  They are, however,  very large in size. Lipids  are defined
as biological  molecules  that are not soluble  in water, but are soluble  in
non-polar  solvents,  such as benzene  and hexanes.
From your previous  studies  of solubility,  you might hypothesize
that lipid molecules  must have large hydrocarbon  parts, since they are
soluble  in hydrocarbon  solvents.  Your hypothesis  would  be correct.
Lipids contain  large hydrocarbon  chains,  or other large hydrocarbon
structures.
Several  types of lipids may be familiar  to you. Fats, oils, and some
waxes are examples  of lipids. Fats are lipids that contain  a glycerol
molecule,  bonded  by ester linkages  to three long-chain  carboxylic  acids.
Oils have the same structure  as fats, but are classified  as being liquid at
room temperature,  while fats are solids at room temperature.  Waxes  are
esters of long-chain  alcohols  and long-chain  carboxylic  acids.
Other lipids include  steroids,  such as cholesterol,  and terpenes,
which  are plant oils such as oil of turpentine,  or oil of cedar. Figure 2.22
shows the lipid glyceryl  trioleate,  which  is present  in olive oil.

Lipids carry out many important  functions  in the body. Their most
important  function  is the long-term  storage  of energy.  One gram of fat con-
tains two-and-a-quarter  times more energy  than a gram of carbohydrate  or
protein.  When an animal  consumes  more carbohydrates  than are needed
at the time, the body converts  the excess carbohydrates  to fat. Later, when
insufficient  carbohydrates  are available  for energy,  the body may break
down some of these fats to use for energy.  Carbohydrates  are still needed
in your diet, however,  for the proper  functioning  of your cells.
94. MHR-* Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry
In addition  to storing  energy,  lipids have other vital functions:
e Cell membranes  are made of a double  layer of phospholipids.  These
are lipids that are polar at one end and non-polar  at the other end.
e Lipids such as cholesterol  and testosterone  act as hormones  to regulate
body functions.  (Not all hormones  are lipids. Some hormones  are
proteins.  Other hormones  are neither  lipids nor proteins.)
e Several  vitamins  (such as vitamins  A, D, and E) are lipids. These
vitamins  are known  as fat-soluble.
e The fatty tissues  in your body are made from lipids. They act like
protective  “packaging”  around  fragile organs,  such as the heart. They
insulate  the body from excessive  heat or cold, and they act as padding
to reduce  impact  from collisions.

Organic  Compounds  and
Everyday  Life
You are already  aware that organic  compounds  are an inescapable  part of
your daily life. As you know, much of your body is composed  of organic
compounds.  The food you eat is made from organic  compounds,  as are the
clothes  you wear. The fuel that heats your home and powers  buses and
cars is also organic.  When  you are sick or injured,  you may use organic
compounds  to fight infection  or to reduce  pain and swelling.  Modern

of organic  compounds.  (See Figure 2.23.)

benefits  that are involved  in making  and using organic  compounds.
Risk-Benefit  Analysis
How can you make the most informed  decision  possible  when analyzing
the risks or benefits  of a product  or issue? The following  steps are one
way to carry out a risk-benefit  analysis  for the manufacture  and use of an
organic  compound.
Step1 Identify  possible  risks and benefits  of the organic  product.  Ask
questions  such as these:
e What are the direct uses of this product?  (For example,  is it used
as a pharmaceutical  drug for a specific  disease  or condition?  Is it
an insecticide  for a specific  insect “pest”?)
e What are the indirect  uses of this product?  (For example,  is it used
in the manufacture  of a different  organic  or inorganic  product?)
e What are the direct risks of making  or using this product?
(For example,  is the product  an environmental  pollutant,  or does
it contain  compounds  that may be harmful  to the environment?
Can the workers  who manufacture  this product  be harmed  by
exposure  to it?)2.4

e What are the indirect  risks of making  or using this product?  (For
example,  are harmful  by-products  produced  in the manufacture
of this product?  How much energy  does the manufacture  of this
product  require,  and where does the energy  come from? What, if
any, side effects does this product  cause?)
Step 2 Research  the answers  to your questions  from step 1. Ensure  that
your information  comes from reliable  sources.  If there is controversy
on the risks and benefits  of the product,  find information  that covers
both sides of the issue.
Step 3 Decide  on your own point of view. In your opinion,  are the benefits
greater  than the risks? Do the risks outweigh  the benefits?
Step 4 Consider  possible  alternatives  that may lessen  the risks. Ask
questions  such as the following:
e Does a similar,  less harmful,  product  exist?
e Is there a better  way to manufacture  or dispose  of this product?
e What safety precautions  can be taken to reduce  the risks?

ThoughtLab
As you know, organic  products  provide  many of the
necessities  and comforts  of your life. They are also
responsible  for a great deal of damage,  including
environmental  pollution  and harm to human  health.
In this Thought  Lab, you will perform  risk-benefit
analyses  on three organic  compounds.
Procedure
1. Choose  three of the organic  compounds  listed in
Tables  2.4 through  2.7. Research  and record  the
chemical  structure  of each compound.
2. Follow  the four steps for a risk-benefit  analysis,
given at the beginning  of this section.  You will
need to carry out additional  research  on the
compounds  of your choice.
Analysis
For each compound,  answer  the following
questions.1. What are the practical  purposes  of this organic
compound?
2. (a) What alternative  compounds  (if any) can be
used for the same purpose?
(b) What are the benefits  of using your particular
compound,  instead  of using the alternatives
in part (a)?
3. (a) What are the direct risks of using this
compound?
(b) What are the indirect  risks of using this
compound?
4. In your opinion,  should  this compound  continue
to be used? Give reasons  for your answer.
5. What safety precautions  could help to reduce
possible  harm—to  people  as well as to the
environment—resulting  from this compound?
Problem  Solving  With Organic  Compounds
Many chemicals  and products  have been developed  as solutions  to health,
safety, and environmental  problems.  Sometimes,  however,  a solution  to
one problem  can introduce  a different  problem.  Read the three articles  on
the next few pages. Then complete  the ThoughtLab  that follows.

Replacing  CFCs—At  What Cost?
At the beginning  of the twentieth
century, refrigeration  was a
relatively  new technology.  Early
refrigerators  depended on_ the
use of toxic gases, such as
ammonia and methyl chloride.
Unfortunately,  these gases some-
times leaked from refrigerators,
leading  to fatal accidents.  In 1928,
a new, “miracle”  compound  was
developed  to replace these toxic
gases. Dichlorodifluoromethane,
commonly  known  as Freon®,  was a
safe, non-toxic  alternative.  Freon®
and other chlorofluorocarbon
compounds,  commonly  referred  to
as CFCs, were also used for
numerous other products and
applications.  They were largely
responsible  for the development  of
many conveniences,  such as air-
conditioning,  that we now take for
granted.
Today we know that CFCs
break up when they reach the
ozone layer, releasing chlorine
atoms. The chlorine  atoms destroy
ozone molecules  faster than the
ozone can regenerate  from oxygen
gas. Studies in the past ten years
have shown dramatic drops in
ozone concentration  at specific
locations.  Since ozone protectsEarth from the Sun’s ultraviolet
radiation,  this decrease in ozone
has led to increases  in skin cancer,
as well as damage to plants and
animals. In addition, CFCs are
potent greenhouse  gases and con-
tribute  to global  warming.  Through
the Montréal  Protocol, and later
“Earth Summit”  gatherings,  many
countries—including  Canada—
have banned  CFC production.
Substitutes  for CFCs are
available, but none provide a
completely  satisfactory  alternative.
Hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs) are
organic compounds  that behave
like CFCs, but do not harm
the ozone layer. For example,
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane  and
1,1-difluoroethane  are HFCs that
can be used to replace CFCs in
refrigerators  and air conditioners.
Unfortunately,  HFCs are also
greenhouse  gases.
Simple  hydrocarbons  can also
be used as CFC substitutes.
Hydrocarbons  such as propane,
2-methylpropane  (common  name:
isobutane),  and butane  are efficient
aerosol propellants.  These hydro-
carbons  are stable and inexpensive,
but they are extremely  flammable.

Revisiting  DDT: Why Did it Happen?
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
better known as DDT, is a well-
known pesticide  that has caused
significant  environmental  damage.
It is easy to point fingers,  blaming
scientists and manufacturers  for
having “unleashed”  this organic
compound  on an unsuspecting
world. It is more difficult,  however,
to understand  why this environ-
mental  disaster  took place.
Insects consume  more than
one third of the world’s  crops each
year. In addition,  insects such as
mosquitoes  spread life-threatening
diseases, including  malaria and
encephalitis.  Weeds reduce crop
yields by taking over space, using
up nutrients,  and blocking  sunlight.
Some weeds even poison the
animals  that the crops are intendedto feed. Crop damage and low
crop yield are significant  problems
for countries undergoing  food
shortages  and famines.
DDT was one of the first
pesticides  that was developed.
For many years, it was used suc-
cessfully  to protect  crops and fight
disease epidemics.  Paul Mueller,
the scientist who discovered
DDT’s use as a pesticide,  was
awarded  the Nobel Prize in 1948.
Cl
CO. ?eejoan!
Cl
DDTLater, however,  tests revealed  that
DDT does not readily decompose
in the environment.  Instead,  DDT
remains present in the soil for
decades  after use. The hydrocarbon
part of this molecule  makes it solu-
ble in the fatty tissues of animals.
As it passes through the food
chain, DDT accumulates.  Animals
that are higher in the food chain,
such as large birds and fish, contain
dangerous  concentrations  of this
chemical  in their tissues. A high
DDT concentration  in birds causes
them to lay eggs with very thin
shells, which are easily destroyed.
Today DDT is no longer  produced
or used in Canada.  It is still used,
however, in many developing
countries.
Knocking  on the Car Door
Automobile  fuels are graded  using
octane numbers, which measure
the combustibility  of a fuel. A high
octane number means that a fuel
requires a higher temperature
and/or higher pressure to ignite.
Racing  cars with high-compression
engines usually run on _ pure
methanol,  which has an octane
number  of 120.
Gasoline with too low
an octane number can cause
“knocking”  in the engine of a car,
when the fuel ignites  too easily and
burns in an uncontrolled  manner.
Knocking  lowers fuel efficiency,
and it can damage  the engine.
As early as 1925, two of the
first automobile  engineers  became
aware of the need to improve  the
octane number of fuels. Charles
Kettering  advocated  the use of a
newly developed  compound  called
tetra-ethyl  lead, Pb(C2H5)4.  This
compound  acts as a catalyst to
102 MHR  «= Unit 1 Organic  Chemistryincrease the efficiency of the
hydrocarbon  combustion  reaction.
Henry Ford believed  that ethanol,
another catalyst, should be used
instead  of tetra-ethyl  lead. Ethanol
could be produced  easily from
locally grown crops. As we now
know, ethanol  is also much better
for the environment.
Tetra-ethyl  lead became the
chosen fuel additive. Over many
decades,  lead emissions  from car
exhausts accumulated  in urban
ponds and water systems. Many
waterfowl  that live in urban areas
experience  lead poisoning.  Lead is
also dangerous  to human  health.
Leaded  fuels are now banned
across Canada.  In unleaded  gaso-
line, simple organic compounds
are added instead of lead com-
pounds. These octane-enhancing
compounds  include  methyl-t-butyl
ether, t-butyl alcohol, methanol,
and ethanol. Like lead catalysts,these compounds  help to reduce
engine  knocking.  In addition,  burn-
ing ethanol  and methanol  produces
fewer pollutants than burning
hydrocarbon  fuels, which contain
contaminants.  Since they can be
made from crops, these alcohols
are a renewable  resource.

Chemistry
Background
Have you ever heard the saying “necessity  is the
mother  of invention”?  Almost  all new products  are
developed  to meet a need. As you have seen in this
unit, however,  new products  carry risks as well as
benefits.  Often, the development  of a new product  is
opposed  by groups  of people  who are concerned
with possible  risks.
There may be several  points of view about any
scientific  development.  These points of view are
influenced  by various  factors  such as the economy,
society,  and politics.
In this unit issue, you will explore  the develop-
ment of new products  through  organic  chemistry.
You will choose  one issue from the list below, and
research  the different  points of view. Then you will
present  your findings,  and your own point of view,
to your class.
¢ Can biofuel  be used to replace  petroleum-based
fuels?  Biofuel  can be made from biological
materials,  such as plants and animal  fats.
Biodiesel  and ethanol  are the two most common
biological  fuels. As part of your research,  find
out what biofuel  is used for. Think  about factors
that may be holding  back the sale of biofuel  on
the Canadian  market.
e Are Canadian  processes  for approving  new phar-
maceutical  drugs adequate,  too extensive,  or not
extensive  enough?  Some Canadians  complain
about the long waiting  period  for a new foreign
drug to be approved  in Canada.  Why is there a
long waiting  period?  What testing  processes  are
needed  for approval  of a new drug in Canada?
e Why are some drugs so expensive?  The
Canadian  government  recently  increased  its drug
patents  from 17 years to 20 years. This should
help drug companies  make sufficient  profits  to
cover the enormous  costs of developing  and test-
ing new drugs. Find out about the costs and pro-
cedures  that are involved  in developing  and test-
ing new drugs. Who finances  drug research?  Is it
fair for drug companies  to hold patents?  What
happens  when these patents  are not honoured?
110 MHR  = Unit 1 Organic  Chemistry¢ Should  all plastics  that are made in the future
be biodegradable?  Biopolymers,  such as pro-
teins and starches,  are used to produce  one type
of biodegradable  plastic. Find out more about
biodegradable  plastics.  How are they made, and
how do they break down?  What are the risks
and benefits?
e Are food additives  necessary?  Should  they be
regulated  more closely?  Almost  all processed
foods contain  food additives.  Choose  three
or more food additives,  not including  any
compounds  that you may have researched  in
Chapter  2. Research  the uses, structures,  and
purposes  of the food additives  you have chosen.

I. 1958, an astonished  television
audience  watched  as Dr. Harry
Coover  used a tiny drop of a
substance  called cyanoacrylate  to
lift a game show host off the ground.
Cyanoacrylate  is an amazingly
powerful  adhesive.  This stunt
helped  launch  the commercial
career of superglue,  now used for
everything  from building  circuit
boards  to sealing  human  tissue in

Superglue  is just one example

The northern lights, also called the aurora borealis, are a fleeting feature
of the night sky in northern  parts of the world. For centuries,  people  who
saw the shimmering,  dancing  sheets of coloured  lights were awed by the
phenomenon,  and tried to explain  it. Inuit that lived near Hudson’s  Bay
told that the lights were caused  by torches  held by spirits to lead souls of
the dead to the afterlife.  In Greenland  and Labrador,  people  thought  the
lights could help predict  the weather.  In Europe  in the Middle  Ages, their
appearance  was an omen of impending  war or plague.
Today, scientists  explain  the northern  lights as resulting  from streams
of protons  and electrons—plasma—emanating  from the Sun. When the
electrons  from the plasma  interact  with gaseous  atoms in Earth’s  upper
atmosphere,  the atoms emit coloured  light.
Nineteenth-century  atomic  theory  could not explain  why the aurora
exhibits  a limited  range of specific  wavelengths,  rather  than the full
visible  spectrum.  Early in the twentieth  century,  however,  scientists
developed  a revolutionary  new model of the atom. This model,  and the
theory  that supports  it, helped  to account  for many puzzling  phenomena
that the existing  atomic  theory  had failed to explain.  Among  these
phenomena  are the characteristic  colours  of the northern  lights.
In this chapter,  you will learn about the developments  that led to the
modern  model of the atom. You will also learn about the model itself and
how it relates  to periodic  trends and the periodic  table.
The green colours  in the northern  lights come
from the interaction  of accelerated  electrons
with oxygen  atoms.  The red colours  usually
come from nitrogen  atoms. How do these
interactions  lead to atoms of different  elements

The Nuclear  Atomic  Model
Toward  the close of the nineteenth  century,  chemists  had two invaluable
conceptual  tools to aid them in their understanding  of matter.  The first
was John Dalton’s  atomic  theory,  which  you have studied  intensively  in
previous  chemistry  courses.  Dalton’s  atomic  theory,  first published  in
1809, provided  chemists  with a framework  for describing  and explaining
the behaviour  of matter  during  chemical  reactions.  As you can see in
Figure 3.1, the model of the atom that resulted  from this theory  was
very simple.
The second  conceptual  tool was Dmitri  Mendeleev’s  periodic  table,
which  listed the known  elements  in order of increasing  atomic  mass. The
resulting  organizational  chart arranged  elements  so that those with similar
chemical  properties  were grouped  together  in the same column.
As you know, Dalton’s  atomic  theory  no longer  applies  in its original
form, and Mendeleev’s  periodic  table has undergone  many changes.  For
example,  scientists  later discovered  that atoms are not the most basic unit
of matter  because  they are divisible.  As well, the modern  periodic  table
lists the elements  in order of their atomic  number,  not their atomic  mass.
Of course,  it also includes  elements  that had not been discovered  in
Mendeleev’s  time. Even so, in modified  form, both of these inventions  are
still studied  and used today in every chemistry  course around  the world.
When  Mendeleev  invented  the periodic  table, he was well-acquainted
with Dalton’s  atomic  theory.  He knew nothing,  however,  about subatomic
particles,  and especially  the electron,  which  is the foundation  for the
modern  periodic  table’s distinctive  shape. Because  the original  periodic
table developed  out of experimental  observations,  chemists  did not need
an understanding  of atomic  structure  to develop  it. (As you will see in
section  3.3, however,  the periodic  table easily accommodates  details  about
atomic  structure.  In fact, you will learn that the modern  periodic  table’s
distinctive  design  is a natural  consequence  of atomic  structure.)
The First Step Toward  the Modern  Atomic  Model
Chemists  needed  Dalton’s  atomic  theory  to advance  their understanding
of matter  and its behaviour  during  chemical  reactions.  His atomic  model,
however,  was inadequate  for explaining  the behaviour  of substances.
For example,  Dalton  designed  a system  of symbols  to show how atoms
combine  to form other substances.  Figure 3.2 on the next page shows
several  of these symbols.  As you will no doubt notice,  Dalton  correctly
predicted  the formulas  for carbon  dioxide  and sulfur trioxide,  but ran into
serious  trouble  with water, ammonia,  and methane.  Dalton’s  attempt  at
molecular  modelling  highlights  a crucial  limitation  with his atomic
model.  Chemists  could not use it to explain  why atoms of elements
combine  in the ratios in which  they do. This inability  did not prevent
chemists  from pursuing  their studies.  It did, however,  suggest  the need
for a more comprehensive  atomic  model.3.1

Scientists  initially  described
radioactivity  solely in terms
of radiation.  The idea of
radioactive  particles  first
appeared  around  the turn of
the twentieth  century.  In 1909,
Ernest Rutherford  reported
confidently  that the alpha
particle  was, in fact, a helium
nucleus,  5He, with a 2+
charge.  Scientists  still had
not discovered  the proton
by this time, so the nature of
the helium nucleus  (or any
other atomic nucleus)  was
still unknown.  In 1919, the
existence  of the proton was
confirmed  experimentally
by, appropriately  enough,
Rutherford  himself.(-) hydrogen ‘eS sulfur eo © carbon dioxide

The Discovery  of the Electron  Requires  a New Atomic  Model
In 1897, Dalton’s  idea of an indivisible  atom was shattered  with  a startling
announcement.  A British  scientist,  Joseph  John Thomson,  had discovered
the existence  of a negatively  charged  particle  with mass less than —n
that of a hydrogen  atom. This particle  was, of course,  the electron.
(Later calculations  showed  that the mass of an electron  is eae that
of a hydrogen  atom.) It took several  years for chemists  to consider  the
consequences  of this discovery.  They realized  that if atoms contain
electrons,  atoms must also contain  a positive  charge of some kind to
balance  the negative  charge.  The atomic  model  that Thomson  eventually
proposed  is shown  in Figure 3.3. Keep in mind that scientists  had not
yet discovered  the proton.  Therefore,  in this model,  the entire sphere
carries  a uniform,  positive  charge.

charged  sphere  embedded  with sufficient  numbers  of electrons  to balance  (neutralize)
the total charge.
Rutherford's  Nuclear  Model of the Atom
In the last four years of the nineteenth  century,  scientists  in France—
notably  Henri Becquerel  and Marie and Pierre Curie—discovered  that
certain  elements  are radioactive.  That is, their atoms naturally  emit
positively  charged  particles  (alpha  particles),  negatively  charged  particles
(beta particles),  and energy  (gamma  radiation).
Working  in his laboratory  at Montreal’s  McGill  University,  Ernest
Rutherford  studied  the chemistry  of radioactive  elements  intensively  from
1898 to 1907. His efforts  would  lead to a Nobel Prize in Chemistry  in
1908. Greater  achievements  lay ahead,  however.
120 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
In 1909, two of Rutherford’s  students  reported  observations  that cast
doubts  on Thomson’s  atomic  model.  As part of ongoing  investigations  into
the nature and properties  of radioactive  emissions,  they aimed alpha (a)
particles  at extremely  thin metal foils. A small number  of the alpha parti-
cles, about one in every 8000, were deflected  significantly  by the atoms
that made up the metal foils. These observations  were inconsistent  with
Thomson’s  atomic  model.  The researchers  expected  the alpha particles
to pass through  the metal atoms with, at most, deflections  averaging  555
of a degree.  Therefore,  deflections  of 90° and more strained  the credibility
of Thomson’s  model.  Rutherford  encouraged  further  investigation.  Either
the observations  and data were flawed,  or Thomson’s  atomic  model was.
As you may recall from earlier  studies,  the flaw lay in Thomson’s
model.  In 1911, Rutherford  published  the results  of the now-famous
gold-foil  experiment,  shown  in Figure 3.4. On the basis of this experi-
ment, Rutherford  suggested  that the deflections  he and his students
observed  were caused  by an encounter  between  an alpha particle  and
an intense  electric  field at the centre of the atom.

GETIOEZ  The hypothesis,  experiment,  and results of Rutherford’s  gold foil experiment.
The experimental  hypothesis  and design  owed much to the contributions  of Rutherford's
students,  Hans Geiger  (of Geiger-counter  fame) and Ernest Marsden.
Rutherford  performed  several  calculations  that led him to an inescapable
conclusion:  the atom is made up mainly  of empty  space, with a small,
massive  region of concentrated  charge at the centre. Soon afterward,  the
charge on this central  region  was determined  to be positive,  and was
named  the atomic  nucleus.  Because  Rutherford’s  atomic  model,  shown
in Figure 3.5 on the next page, pictures  electrons  in motion  around  an
atomic  nucleus,  chemists  often call this the nuclear  model of the atom.
You may also see it referred  to as a planetary  model  because  the electrons
resemble  the planets  in motion  around  a central  body.
Chapter  3 Atoms,  Electrons,  and Periodic  Trends » MHR_ 121
Contrary  to common  belief,
Rutherford’s  1911 paper on the
discovery  of the nucleus  does
not associate  the nucleus  with
a positive  charge.  In fact,
Rutherford  acknowledged  that
the results of his experiment
were independent  of the sign
of the charge.  He suggested
that the charge of the nucleus,
as well as other questions
raised by his paper, were sub-
jects for later investigation.
Sometime  between  1911 and
1913, someone  identified  the
charge  on the nucleus  as
positive.  Whether  or not this
person  was Rutherford  is
not clear.

similar,  disk-shaped  model with electrons  orbiting  a positively  charged  nucleus,  in 1904.
Rutherford  notes in his 1911 paper that his results  would be the same if Nagaoka’s  model
were correct.
Prelude  to a New Atomic  Model
Rutherford’s  atomic  model solved  problems  inherent  in Thomson’s
atomic  model,  but it also raised others. For example,  an atomic  nucleus
composed  entirely  of positive  charges  should  fly apart due to electrostatic
forces of repulsion.  Furthermore,  Rutherford’s  nuclear  atom could not
adequately  explain  the total mass of an atom. The discovery  of the
neutron,  in 1932, eventually  helped  to settle these questions.
There was a more significant  problem,  however.  Rutherford’s  atomic
model seemed  to contradict  the laws of nineteenth-century  physics.
According  to these assumptions,  an electron  in motion  around  a central
body must continuously  give off radiation.  Consequently,  one should  be
able to observe  a continuous  spectrum  (a “rainbow”)  of light energy  as the
electron  gives off its radiation.
Because  the electron  should  also lose energy  as a result of this
radiation,  the radius of its orbit should  continuously  decrease  in size
until it spirals  into the nucleus.  This predicted  annihilation  of the atom
would  occur in a fraction  of a second.  However,  atoms were not seen to
destabilize  as predicted  by this model.
Nineteenth-century  physics  could not explain  why Rutherford’s
model corresponded  to a stable atom. The solution  to this problem
marked  a turning  point in the history  of chemistry  and physics.  To
appreciate  the scope of the problem,  and the impact  of its eventual
solution,  it is necessary  to remain  a short while longer  in the nineteenth
century.  In the following  pages, you will examine  a phenomenon  that
scientists  of the time could not explain.
The Problem  of Atomic  Spectra
You probably  recall that visible  light is part of a broader  continuum
of energy  called the electromagnetic  spectrum.  Figure 3.6 reviews  the key
properties  of the electromagnetic  spectrum  of energy.

| Figure 3.6 | The electromagnetic  spectrum  and its properties
The visible  portion  of the electromagnetic  spectrum  is called a continuous
spectrum,  because  the component  colours  are indistinct.  They appear
“smeared”  together  into a continuum  of colour.  According  to nineteenth-
century  physics,  part of the energy  emitted  by electrons  should  be
observable  as a continuous  spectrum.  This is not, however,  the case.
Instead,  when atoms absorb energy  (for example,  when they are exposed
to an electric  current),  you observe  a pattern  of discrete  (distinct),
coloured  lines separated  by spaces  of varying  length.  See Figure 3.7. You
can also observe  this line spectrum  for hydrogen,  and for other atoms,  in

a glass tube that contains  hydrogen  gas at low

colour.  If you observe  this gas discharge  tube

you can see distinct,  coloured  lines. This type
of spectrum  is called a line spectrum  or an
emission  spectrum.  Chemists  first observed
spectra  like this in the mid-1800s.
Question
Can the Rutherford  model of the atom explain
the emission  spectra  of elements?
Predictions
The Rutherford  model of the atom described
electrons  as tiny masses  in motion  around  a
nucleus.  According  to this model,  excited  atoms
should  emit a continuous  spectrum  of light
energy  as their electrons  give off radiation.  In
fact, according  to this model,  atoms should
continually  radiate  energy  whether  they are
excited  or not. Read through  the procedure  and
predict  whether  your observations  will support
or contradict  the Rutherford  model.  Give reasons
for your answer.

Scientists  of the nineteenth  century  lacked  the concepts  necessary  to
explain  line spectra.  Even in the first decade  of the twentieth  century,  a
suitable  explanation  proved  elusive.  This changed  in 1913 when Niels
Bohr, a Danish  physicist  and student  of Rutherford,  proposed  a new
model for the hydrogen  atom. This model  retained  some of the features  of
Rutherford’s  model.  More importantly,  it was able to explain  the line spec-
trum for hydrogen  because  it incorporated  several  new ideas about energy.
As you can see in Figure 3.8, Bohr’s atomic  model pictures  electrons  in
orbit around  a central  nucleus.  Unlike  Rutherford’s  model,  however,  in
which  electrons  may move anywhere  within  the volume  of space around
the nucleus,  Bohr’s model imposes  certain  restrictions.
The Bohr Atomic  Model
1. The atom has only specific,  allowable  energy  levels, called
stationary  states. Each stationary  state corresponds  to the atom’s
electrons  occupying  fixed, circular  orbits around  the nucleus.
2. While in one of its stationary  states, atoms do not emit energy.
3. An atom changes  stationary  states by emitting  or absorbing  a
specific  quantity  of energy  that is exactly  equal to the difference
in energy  between  the two stationary  states.
On what basis could Bohr make these claims?  In 1900, a physicist  named
Max Planck  proposed  an idea that was so revolutionary  that he himself
was unwilling  to accept  its implications.  Planck  suggested  that matter,  at
the atomic  level, can absorb  or emit only discrete  quantities  of energy.
Each of these specific  quantities  is called a quantum  of energy.  In other
words,  Planck  said that the energy  of an atom is quantized.  Something
that is quantized  can exist only in certain  discrete  amounts.  It is not
continuous.  In this sense, the rungs of a ladder  are quantized,  while the
smooth  slope of a ramp is not. Unlike  ladders  and ramps,  however,  a
quantum  is an extremely  small “packet”  of energy.
Although  Planck  said that the energy  of matter  is quantized,  he con-
tinued  to describe  energy  as travelling  in the form of waves.  He was, in
fact, unwilling  to consider  that energy  might have particle-like  properties.
In 1905, however,  Albert  Einstein  was prepared  to make just such an
assertion.  Light, according  to Einstein,  is also quantized.  It occurs  as
quanta  of electromagnetic  energy  that have particle-like  properties.  These
particle-like  “packets”  of energy  were later called photons.  In Einstein’s
view, light (and, by extension,  all electromagnetic  energy)  travels  in the
form of photons  of energy.  Light is emitted  as photons  of energy,  and light
is absorbed  as photons  of energy.
How Bohr’s  Atomic  Model
Explains  the Spectrum  for Atomic  Hydrogen
If you re-read  the key points of Bohr’s atomic  model  above, you can see
that he is applying  the new ideas of quanta  in his model.  Bohr proposed
that the energy  that is emitted  and absorbed  by an atom must have
specific  values.  The change  in energy  when an electron  moves  to higher
or lower energy  levels is not continuous.  It is, rather, quantized.
126 MHR-» Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Look again at the line spectrum  for hydrogen  shown  in Figure 3.7.
The energy  that is associated  with the coloured  lines in this spectrum
corresponds  to the change  in energy  of an electron  as it moves  to higher
or lower energy  levels. For example,  when a hydrogen  atom is exposed
to electrical  current,  or to another  form of electromagnetic  energy,  its
electron  absorbs  photons  of energy.  The atom is now said to be in an
excited  state. Another  common  way for atoms to become  excited  is
through  atomic  collisions.  For example,  when two hydrogen  atoms
collide,  some of the kinetic  energy  from one atom is transferred  to the
other atom. The electron  of the second  hydrogen  atom absorbs  this energy
and is excited  to a higher  energy  level.
When the electron  of a hydrogen  atom that has been excited  to the
third energy  level falls to the second  energy  level, it emits light of certain
energy. Specifically,  an electron  that makes a transition  from the third
energy  level to the second  energy  level emits a photon  of red light with
a wavelength  of 656 nm. Because  line spectra  result when atoms in an
excited  state emit photons  as they fall to a lower energy  level, these
spectra  are also called emission  spectra.
Figure 3.9 shows the energy  transitions  that are responsible  for the
coloured  lines in hydrogen’s  emission  spectrum.  Notice the use of the
symbol  n to designate  the allowed  energy  levels for the hydrogen  atom:
n=1,n=  2, and so on. This symbol,  n, represents  a positive  integer  (such
as 1, 2, or 3), and is called a quantum  number.  You will learn more about
the significance  of quantum  numbers  in section  3.2.

corresponds  to one of the coloured  lines in the spectrum.

excited  from lower energy  levels to higher  energy  levels. Figure 3.10
shows the absorption  spectrum  for hydrogen.  As you can see, discrete,
dark lines appear  in the precise  locations  (wavelengths)  as those of the
coloured  lines in hydrogen’s  emission  spectrum.

GEESERTY  When light passes  through  gaseous  hydrogen  atoms, the electrons  in the
hydrogen  atoms absorb  photons  of red, green, blue, and purple light at specific  wavelengths.
When the electrons  return to lower energy  levels,  they re-emit  photons  with these same
wavelengths.  However,  most of the photons  are emitted  in a different  direction  from the one in
which  the electrons  absorbed  the light. As a result,  dark lines appear  in the spectrum  where
photons  of those particular  wavelengths  are absent.
The Successes  and Limitations  of the Bohr Atomic  Model
Bohr’s  realization  that the atom’s energy  is quantized—that  electrons  are
restricted  to specific  energy  levels (orbits)—was  an astounding  achieve-
ment. As you have seen, this model successfully  predicted  the coloured

There was a problem  with Bohr’s model,  however.  It successfully
explained  only one-electron  systems.  That is, it worked  fine for
hydrogen  and for ions with only one electron,  such as He’, Li?*, and Be**.
Bohr’s  model  was unable,  however,  to explain  the emission  spectra
produced  by atoms with two or more electrons.  Either Bohr’s model  was
a coincidence,  or it was an oversimplification  in need of modification.
Further  investigation  was in order.
Nuclear  Medicine
This scan, a product  of a nuclear  medical  technology  called
PET, shows  changes  in metabolic  activity  in different  parts of
the brain. The red colour indicates  greater  activity.
The discovery  of the atomic  nucleus  affected  all
sciences,  including  biology  and its applications  in
the field of medicine.  During  her graduate  studies
at the University  of Western  Ontario,  Dr. Karen
Goulenchyn  excelled  in theoretical  mathematics,
but switched  to medicine  because  she was drawn
to practical  applications  of science  in people’s
lives. An interest  in computers  led her to nuclear
medicine,  which she now practices  at the Civic
Hospital  in Ottawa.
Nuclear  medicine  is used chiefly  in medical
diagnosis.  A radiopharmaceutical—a  relatively
harmless  compound  with a low dose of radiation—
is swallowed  or injected  into the patient  and tracked
through  the bloodstream  by instruments  such as a
PET (positron  emission  tomography)  camera.  The
nuclear  physician  can use the results  to create athree-dimensional  computer  image  that evaluates
the function  as well as the structure  of an organ.
This procedure  enables  the physician  to diagnose
cancers  and other  tissue irregularities  without  the
need for more invasive  techniques  such as
exploratory  surgery.
The dose of radiation  that patients  receive  is
similar  to that of a diagnostic  x-ray. However,
because  many patients  are alarmed  by the word
“nuclear,”  Dr. Goulenchyn  says that her team must
explain  the procedure  tactfully  “so that they don’t
run away.”  Some physicians  ease fears by calling
the discipline  “molecular  medicine.”
Dr. Goulenchyn  sees an increase  of 6 to12
percent  of patients  annually,  primarily  for suspected
cancer  or heart disease.  Her greatest  frustration
is the time she must spend lobbying  for new
equipment,  particularly  for PET, a technique  for
measuring  the concentrations  of positron-emitting
radioisotopes  within the tissues.  Positrons  are a
form of radiation  identical  to a beam of electrons,
except  that the charge  of a positron  is positive.  PET
scans can assess  biochemical  changes  in the body,
especially  abnormal  ones. These scans provide
greater  accuracy  in determining  whether  a current
Or proposed  therapy  is effective.
A career  in nuclear  medicine,  Dr. Goulenchyn
notes, requires  excellence  in computers,  science,
and people  skills, with a strong  background  in
physiology.  It also offers an unusual  benefit  for a
physician:  regular  working  hours. She appreciates
the time this provides  for her family,  as well as for
her work with the Canadian  Association  of Nuclear
Medicine,  for which she served  as president  from
1996 to 1998.

The Quantum  Mechanical  Model
of the Atom
You have seen how Bohr’s  model of the atom explains  the emission  spec-
trum of hydrogen.  The emission  spectra  of other atoms,  however,  posed a
problem.  A mercury  atom, for example,  has many more electrons  than a
hydrogen  atom. As you can see in Figure 3.12, mercury  has more spectral
lines than hydrogen  does. The same is true for other many-electron  atoms.
Observations  like these forced  Bohr and other scientists  to reconsider  the
nature  of energy  levels. The large spaces  between  the individual  colours
suggested  that there are energy  differences  between  individual  energy
levels, as stated in Bohr’s model.  The smaller  spaces  between  coloured
lines, however,  suggested  that there were smaller  energy  differences
within energy  levels. In other words,  scientists  hypothesized  that there are
sublevels  within  each energy  level. Each of these sublevels  has its own
slightly  different  energy.

(GGEEISEXE]  The emission  spectrum  for mercury  shows that it has more spectral  lines
than the emission  spectrum  for hydrogen.
It was fairly straightforward  to modify  Bohr’s model  to include  the idea
of energy  sublevels  for the hydrogen  spectrum  and for atoms or ions with
only one electron.  There was a more fundamental  problem,  however.  The
model still could not explain  the spectra  produced  by many-electron
atoms. Therefore,  a simple  modification  of Bohr’s  atomic  model  was not
enough.  The many-electron  problem  called for a new model  to explain
spectra  of all types of atoms.  However,  this was not possible  until another
important  property  of matter  was discovered.
The Discovery  of Matter  Waves
By the early 1920s, it was standard  knowledge  that energy  had matter-like
properties.  In 1924, a young physics  student  named  Louis de Broglie
stated a hypothesis  that followed  from this idea. What if, de Broglie
wondered,  matter  has wave-like  properties?
He developed  an equation  that enabled  him to calculate  the wave-
length  associated  with any object  — large, small, or microscopic.  For
example,  a baseball  with a mass of 142 g and moving  with a speed of
25.0 m/s has a wavelength  of 2 x 10-°* m. Objects  that you can see and
interact  with, such as a baseball,  have wavelengths  so small that they
do not have any significant  observable  effect on the object’s  motion.
However,  for microscopic  objects,  such as electrons,  the effect of wave-
length on motion  becomes  very significant.  For example,  an electron
moving  at a speed of 5.9 x 10° m/s has a wavelength  of 1 x 101° m. The
size of this wavelength  is greater  than the size of the hydrogen  atom to
which  it belongs.  (The calculated  atomic  radius of hydrogen  is
5.3 x 107?! m.)3.2

| Figure 3.13 | The model of the
atom in 1927. The fuzzy, spherical
region  that surrounds  the nucleus
represents  the volume  in which
electrons  are most likely to be
found.De Broglie’s  hypothesis  of matter  waves received  experimental
support  in 1927. Researchers  observed  that streams  of moving  electrons
produced  diffraction  patterns  similar  to those that are produced  by waves
of electromagnetic  radiation.  Since diffraction  involves  the transmission
of waves through  a material,  the observation  seemed  to support  the idea
that electrons  had wave-like  properties.
The Quantum  Mechanical  Model of the Atom
In 1926, an Austrian  physicist,  Erwin Schrodinger,  used mathematics  and
statistics  to combine  de Broglie’s  idea of matter  waves and Einstein’s  idea
of quantized  energy  particles  (photons).  Schrédinger’s  mathematical
equations  and their interpretations,  together  with another  idea called
Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle  (discussed  below),  resulted  in the birth
of the field of quantum  mechanics.  This is a branch  of physics  that uses
mathematical  equations  to describe  the wave properties  of sub-microscopic
particles  such as electrons,  atoms, and molecules.  Schrédinger  used
concepts  from quantum  mechanics  to propose  a new atomic  model:  the
quantum  mechanical  model  of the atom. This model describes  atoms as
having  certain  allowed  quantities  of energy  because  of the wave-like
properties  of their electrons.
Figure 3.13 depicts  the volume  surrounding  the nucleus  of the atom
as being indistinct  or cloud-like  because  of a scientific  principle  called the
uncertainty  principle.  The German  physicist  Werner  Heisenberg  proposed
the uncertainty  principle  in 1927. Using mathematics,  Heisenberg  showed
that it is impossible  to know both the position  and the momentum  of an
object  beyond  a certain  measure  of precision.  (An object’s  momentum  is a
property  given by its mass multiplied  by its velocity.)  According  to this
principle,  if you can know an electron’s  precise  position  and path around
the nucleus,  as you would  by defining  its orbit, you cannot  know with
certainty  its velocity.  Similarly,  if you know its precise  velocity,  you
cannot  know with certainty  its position.  Based on the uncertainty
principle,  Bohr’s atomic  model is flawed  because  you cannot  assign
fixed paths (orbits)  to the motion  of electrons.
Clearly,  however,  electrons  exist. And they must exist somewhere.  To
describe  where that “somewhere”  is, scientists  used an idea from a branch
of mathematics  called statistics.  Although  you cannot  talk about electrons
in terms of certainties,  you can talk about them in terms of probabilities.
Schrédinger  used a type of equation  called a wave equation  to define the
probability  of finding  an atom’s electrons  at a particular  point within  the
atom. There are many solutions  to this wave equation,  and each solution
represents  a particular  wave function.  Each wave function  gives informa-
tion about an electron’s  energy  and location  within  an atom. Chemists
call these wave functions  orbitals.
In further  studies  of chemistry  and physics,  you will learn that the
wave functions  that are solutions  to the Schrédinger  equation  have no
direct, physical  meaning.  They are mathematical  ideas. However,  the
square  of a wave function  does have a physical  meaning.  It is a quantity
that describes  the probability  that an electron  is at a particular  point
within  the atom at a particular  time. The square of each wave function
(orbital)  can be used to plot three-dimensional  probability  distribution
graphs  for that orbital.  These plots help chemists  visualize  the space in
which  electrons  are most likely to be found around  atoms. These plots are
132 MHR» Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
also referred  to as electron  probability  density  graphs.  Note: Although
orbitals  are wave functions  without  associated  physical  characteristics
like shape and size, chemists  often use the term orbitals  when they mean
three-dimensional  probability  distribution  graphs.  To simplify  discussion,
this textbook  will discuss  the size and shapes  of orbitals.  However,  what
is really meant  is their associated  probability  distribution  graph,  which  is
calculated  using the square of the wave function.
Each orbital  has its own associated  energy,  and each represents
information  about where,  inside  the atom, the electrons  would  spend
most of their time. Scientists  cannot  determine  the actual paths of the
moving  electrons.  However,  orbitals  indicate  where there is a high
probability  of finding  electrons.
Figure 3.14A represents  the probability  of finding  an electron  at any
point in space when the electron  is at the lowest  energy  level (n = 1) of a
hydrogen  atom. Where  the density  of the dots is greater,  there is a higher
probability  of finding  the electron.  This graph is “fuzzy-looking”  because
the probability  of finding  the electron  anywhere  in the n = 1 energy
level of a hydrogen  atom is never zero. Farther  from the nucleus,  the
probability  becomes  very small, but it will still never reach zero.
Therefore,  because  the shape of the n = 1 orbital for hydrogen  represents
the level of probability  of finding  an electron,  and since the probability CONCEPT  CHECK
never reaches  zero, you have to select a “cut-off” level of probability.

Quantum  Numbers  and Orbitals
Figure 3.14 showed  electron-density  probabilities  for the lowest  energy
level of the hydrogen  atom. This is the most stable energy  state for
hydrogen,  and is called the ground  state. The quantum  number,  n, for a
hydrogen  atom in its ground  state is 1. When  n = 1 in the hydrogen  atom,
its electron  is associated  with an orbital  that has a characteristic  energy
and shape. In an excited  state, the electron  is associated  with a different
orbital  with its own characteristic  energy  and shape. This makes sense,
because  the electron  has absorbed  energy  in its excited  state, so its total
energy  increases  and its motion  changes.  Figure 3.15 on the next page
compares  the sizes of hydrogen’s  atomic  orbitals  when the atom is in its
ground  state and when it is in an excited  state.

GETESERTY  The relationship
between  orbital size and quantum
number  for the hydrogen  atom.
As nincreases,  the electron’s
energy  increases  and orbital size
increases.Orbitals  have a variety  of different  possible  shapes.  Therefore,
scientists  use three quantum  numbers  to describe  an atomic  orbital.  One
quantum  number,  n, describes  an orbital’s  energy  level and size. A second
quantum  number,  /, describes  an orbital’s  shape. A third quantum  number,
my, describes  an orbital’s  orientation  in space. These three quantum
numbers  are described  further  below. The Concept  Organizer  that follows
afterward  summarizes  this information.  (In section  3.3, you will learn
about a fourth  quantum  number,  m,, which  is used to describe  the
electron  inside an orbital.)
The First Quantum  Number:
Describing  Orbital  Energy  Level and Size
The principal  quantum  number  (n) is a positive  whole  number  that
specifies  the energy  level of an atomic  orbital  and its relative  size. The
value of n, therefore,  may be 1, 2, 3, and so on. A higher  value for n
indicates  a higher  energy  level. A higher  n value also means  that the
size of the energy  level is larger, with a higher  probability  of finding
an electron  farther  from the nucleus.  The greatest  number  of electrons
that is possible  in any energy  level is 2n’.
The Second  Quantum  Number:  Describing  Orbital  Shape
The second  quantum  number  describes  an orbital’s  shape, and is a posi-
tive integer  that ranges  in value from 0 to (n — 1). Chemists  use a variety
of names  for the second  quantum  number.  For example,  you may see it
referred  to as the angular  momentum  quantum  number,  the azimuthal
quantum  number,  the secondary  quantum  number,  or the orbital-shape
quantum  number.
Regardless  of its name, the second  quantum  number  refers to the
energy  sublevels  within  each principal  energy  level. The name that this
book uses for the second  quantum  number  is orbital-shape  quantum
number  (1), to help you remember  that the value of / determines  orbital
shape. (You will see examples  of orbital shapes  near the end of this
section.)
The value of n places precise  limits on the value of /. Recall that /
has a maximum  value of (n —- 1). So, ifn =1, /=0 (that is, 1 -—1). Ifn = 2,
I may be either 0 or 1. If n = 3, / may be either 0, 1, or 2. Notice  that the
number  of possible  values  for / in a given energy  level is the same as the
value of n. In other words,  if n = 2, then there are only two possible  sub-
levels (two types of orbital shapes)  at this energy  level.
Each value for / is given  a letter: s, p, d, or f.
e The / = 0 orbital  has the letter s.
e The /=1 orbital  has the letter p.
e The / = 2 orbital  has the letter d.
e The / = 3 orbital  has the letter  f.
To identify  an energy  sublevel  (type of orbital),  you combine  the value
of n with the letter of the orbital shape. For example,  the sublevel  with
n=3 and/ =O is called the 3s sublevel.  The sublevel  with n= 2 and/=1
is the 2p sublevel.
134 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
There are, in fact, additional  sublevels  beyond  / = 3. However,  for
chemical  systems  known  at this time, only the s, p, d, and fsublevels  are
required.
The Third Quantum  Number:  Describing  Orbital  Orientation
The magnetic  quantum  number  (mz)) is an integer  with values  ranging
from —/ to +/, including  0. This quantum  number  indicates  the orientation
of the orbital  in the space around  the nucleus.  The value of m, is limited
by the value of /. If/ = 0, m) can be only O. In other words,  for a given
value of n, there is only one orbital,  of s type (/ = 0). If /=1, m; may haveThe letters used to represent
energy  sublevels  are

there are three orbitals  of p type (/ = 1). Each of these p orbitals  has the
same shape and energy,  but a different  orientation  around  the nucleus.
Notice  that for any given value of /, there are (2/ + 1) values  for m).
The total number  of orbitals  for any energy  level n is given by n7’.
For example,  if n = 2, it has a total of 4 (that is, 2?) orbitals  (an s orbital
and three p orbitals).  The Sample  Problem  below shows further  use of
this calculation.

total number  of orbitals  in this energy  level?
(b) What are the possible  values  for m; ifn =5 and /=1? What kind of
orbital  is described  by these quantum  numbers?  How many orbitals
can be described  by these quantum  numbers?
Chapter  3 Atoms,  Electrons, and Periodic  Trends * MHR_ 135
\.Solution
(a) The allowed  values for / are integers  ranging  from 0 to (n — 1). The
allowed  values for m; are integers  ranging  from —/ to +/ including  0.
Since each orbital  has a single m; value, the total number  of values
for m; gives the number  of orbitals.
To find / from n:
Ifn = 3, / may be either 0, 1, or 2.
To find m; from /:
If/=0,m;=0
If /=1, my may be —1, 0, +1
If/ = 2, m) may be —2, —1, 0, +1, +2
Since there are a total of 9 possible  values for m), there are 9 orbitals
when n= 3.
(b) You determine  the type of orbital  by combining  the value for n with
the letter used to identify  /. You can find possible  values for m; from
/, and the total of the m; values  gives the number  of orbitals.
To name the type of orbital:
!=1, which  describes  a p orbital
Since n= 5, the quantum  numbers  represent  a 5p orbital.
To find m; from !:
If /=1, my may be —1, 0, +1
Therefore,  there are 3 possible  5p orbitals.
Check Your Solution
(a) Since the total number  of orbitals  for any given n is n*?, when n = 3,
the number  of orbitals  must be 9 (that is, 32).
(b) The number  m values  is equivalent  to 2/+ 1: 2(1)+1=3.  Since the
number  of orbitals  equals  the number  of m; values,  the answer  of 3

136 MHR» Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Shapes  of Orbitals
An orbital is associated  with a size, a three-dimensional  shape, and an
orientation  around  the nucleus.  Together,  the size, shape, and position
of an orbital represent  the probability  of finding  a specific  electron
around  the nucleus  of an atom. Figure 3.16 shows the probability  shapes
associated  with the s, p, and d orbitals.  (The f orbitals  have been omitted
due to their complexity.  You may study these orbitals  in post-secondary
school chemistry  courses.)
Notice that the overall  shape of an atom is a combination  of all its
orbitals.  Thus, the overall shape of an atom is spherical.  Be careful,  how-
ever, to distinguish  for yourself  between  the overall spherical  shape of the
atom, and the spherical  shape that is characteristic  of only the s orbitals.
Finally,  it is important  to be clear about what orbitals  are when you
view diagrams  such as those in Figure 3.16. Orbitals,  remember,  are solu-
tions to mathematical  equations.  Those solutions,  when manipulated,
describe  the motion  and position  of the electron  in terms of probabilities.
Contour  diagrams,  such as those shown  here and in numerous  print and
electronic  resources,  appear  solid. It therefore  becomes  easy to begin
thinking  about orbitals  as physical  “containers”  that are “occupied”  by
electrons.  In some ways, this is unavoidable.  Try to remind  yourself,
now and then, of the following:
e Electrons  have physical  substance.  They have a mass that can be
measured,  and trajectories  that can be photographed.  They exist in
the physical  universe.
e Orbitals  are mathematical  descriptions  of electrons.  They do not have
measurable  physical  properties  such as mass or temperature.  They exist
in the imagination.

Section  Summary
In this section,  you saw how the ideas of quantum  mechanics  led to a
new, revolutionary  atomic  model—the  quantum  mechanical  model of
the atom. According  to this model,  electrons  have both matter-like  and
wave-like  properties.  Their position  and momentum  cannot  both be deter-
mined  with certainty,  so they must be described  in terms of probabilities.
An orbital  represents  a mathematical  description  of the volume  of space
in which  an electron  has a high probability  of being found. You learned
the first three quantum  numbers  that describe  the size, energy,  shape,
and orientation  of an orbital.  In the next section,  you will use quantum
numbers  to describe  the total number  of electrons  in an atom and the
energy  levels in which  they are most likely to be found in their ground
state. You will also discover  how the ideas of quantum  mechanics  explain
the structure  and organization  of the periodic  table.

Electron  Configurations
and Periodic  Trends
For the hydrogen  atom (and other single-electron  systems),  all orbitals  that
have the same value for n have the same energy.  You can see this in the
energy  level diagram  shown  in Figure 3.17. Hydrogen’s  single electron  is
in its lowest  (most stable) energy  state when it is in the 1s orbital.  In other
words, the 1s orbital is the ground  state for hydrogen.  When a hydrogen
atom is in an excited  state, its electron  may be found in any of its other
orbitals,  depending  on the amount  of energy  absorbed.

For the hydrogen  atom, orbital energy  depends  only on the value of n. For
example,  all four n = 2 orbitals  have the same energy.  All nine = 3 orbitals  have the same
energy.  What must the value of / be for each of these orbitals?
Atoms with two or more electrons  have orbitals  with shapes  that are
similar  to those of hydrogen.  However,  the interactions  among  the
additional  electrons  result in orbitals  with the same value of n, but
different  energies.  For example,  Figure 3.18 shows an energy  level
diagram  for the lithium  atom, which has three electrons.  You can see that
the 2s orbital  has a lower energy  than the 2p orbitals.  Similarly,  the 3p
orbitals  are lower in energy  than the 3d orbitals.  Notice,  however,  that all
the orbitals  within  a sublevel  have the same energy. For example,  the
three p orbitals  in the 3p sublevel  have the same energy.

Since low energy  usually  means  stability,  it is reasonable  that the
most stable energy  state (ground  state) for any atom is one in which  its
electrons  are in the lowest  possible  energy  level. As you know, this is the
1s orbital (n = 1). However,  the electrons  of most atoms are not “packed”
into this orbital.  In fact, experimental  evidence  shows that only two atoms
have all their electrons  in the 1s orbital:  hydrogen  and helium.  To explain
how and why this is the case, you must consider  another  property  of the
electron.
The Fourth Quantum  Number:  A Property  of the Electron
As you learned  from the previous  section,  three quantum  numbers—n,  J,
and m;—describe  the energy,  size, shape, and spatial orientation  of an
orbital.  A fourth  quantum  number  describes  a property  of the electron  that
results  from its particle-like  nature.  Experimental  evidence  suggests  that
electrons  spin about their axes as they move throughout  the volume  of
their atoms. Like a tiny top, an electron  can spin in one of two directions,
each direction  generating  a magnetic  field. The spin quantum  number
(m,) specifies  the direction  in which  the electron  is spinning.  This
quantum  number  has only two possible  values:  +2 or —2.
In 1925, an Austrian  physicist,  Wolfgang  Pauli, proposed  that only two
electrons  of opposite  spin could occupy  an orbital.  This proposal  became
known  as the Pauli exclusion  principle.  What the exclusion  principle
does is place a limit on the total number  of electrons  that may occupy  any
orbital.  That is, an orbital  may have a maximum  of two electrons  only,
each of which  must have the opposite  spin direction  of the other. It may
also have only one electron  of either spin direction.  An orbital  may also
have no electrons  at all.

orbital-shape integers  from 0 to (n — 1) orbital  shape
magnetic my integers  from —/ to +] orbital  orientation
spin Ms + or = electron  spin direction
The Pauli Exclusion  Principle  and Quantum  Numbers
Another  way of stating  the exclusion  principle  is that no two electrons
in an atom have the same  four quantum  numbers.  This important  idea
means  that each electron  in an atom has its own unique  set of four
quantum  numbers.  For example,  compare  the quantum  numbers
that distinguish  a ground  state hydrogen  atom from a helium  atom. (Recall
that a helium  atom has two electrons.  Note also that m, quantum  number
is given as +t. It could just as easily have a value of —t. By convention,
chemists  usually  use the positive  value first.)

Helium first n=1,1=0,  mj=0,m,=+4
second n=1,1=0, mj=0,  ms =-+
140 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Each of a lithium  atom’s  three electrons  also has its own unique  set of
quantum  numbers,  as you can see below. (Assume  these quantum
numbers  represent  a ground  state lithium  atom.)
Atom Electron Quantum  numbers
Lithium first n=1,1=0,  mj=0,m,=+5

Consider  the significance  of lithium’s  quantum  numbers.  The first two
electrons  occupy  the 1s orbital,  and have the same sets of quantum
numbers  as helium’s  two electrons.  According  to the Pauli exclusion
principle,  the 1s orbital (n = 1) is now “full” because  it contains  the
maximum  number  of electrons:  two. For lithium’s  third electron,  n
cannot  equal 1. Therefore,  the next principal  energy  level for the electron
is n= 2. Ifn=2,  ] may have a value of 0 or 1. Remember  that an atom’s
ground  state represents  its lowest  energy  state. Because  an orbital  with
!=0 (an s orbital)  has a lower energy  than an orbital  with ] = 1
(a p orbital),  you would  expect  a high probability  of finding  lithium’s
third electron  in the s orbital  given by n = 2, / = 0. In fact, experimental
evidence  supports  this expectation.  You know that if ] = 0, m; has only
one possible  value: 0. Finally,  by convention,  m, is +4.
It is possible  to distinguish  atoms by writing  sets of quantum  numbers
for each of their electrons.  However,  writing  quantum  numbers  for an
atom such as uranium,  which  has 92 electrons,  would  be mind-bogglingly
tedious.  Fortunately,  chemists  have developed  a “shortcut”  to represent
the number  and orbital arrangements  of electrons  in each atom. As you
will see shortly,  these electron  configurations,  as they are called,  are
intimately  connected  to the structure  and logic of the periodic  table.
In learning  how to write electron  configurations,  you will discover  this
connection.  You will also find out why orbital  energies  differ (for
example,  why  a 2s orbital  is lower  in energy  than a 2p orbital).
Note: Before  proceeding,  it is important  to keep the following  in mind.
According  to quantum  mechanics:
e Electrons  do not “occupy”  orbitals.  Nor do orbitals  “contain”  electrons.
e Electrons  do not “fill” orbitals  one at a time. Nor do electrons  have
properties  that designate  individual  electrons  as first, second,  third,
fourth, etc.
e Orbitals  do not really have substance  or shapes.  Orbitals,  recall,
are mathematical  equations  that can be used to calculate  probability
densities  for electrons.  The shapes,  and the impression  of substance,
result from the contour  lines used to set a limit on the extent of
those probabilities.
Nevertheless,  it takes time and experience  for most people  to think
about and talk about atoms in completely  quantum  mechanical  terms. It is
much simpler  to think about orbitals  as if they have substance.  Therefore,
in the text that follows,  you will read about electrons  “occupying”  and
“filling”  orbitals.  Strictly  speaking,  this terminology  is not scientifically
correct.  However,  it will help you understand  some challenging  concepts
more easily.CONCEPT  CHECK

(GETESERE)  Atomic orbitals  and their relative  energies
Figure 3.19 shows the total number  of orbitals  in which electrons  are
likely to be found for all naturally  occurring  atoms and most synthetic
atoms. The orbitals,  represented  by boxes, are listed in order of increasing
energy. You will refer to this diagram  often as you learn to write electron
configurations.
An atom’s electron  configuration  is a shorthand  notation  that shows
the number  and arrangement  of electrons  in its orbitals.  Because  the
value of n ranges to infinity,  there are an infinite  number  of electron
configurations  that are possible  for each atom. For each atom, all but
one of these represent  the atom in an excited  state. However,  an atom’s
chemical  properties  are mainly  associated  with its ground  state electron
configuration.  Therefore,  unless stated otherwise,  you can assume  that
any given electron  configuration  in this book represents  an atom in its
ground  state. For example,  the ground  state electron  configuration  for a
hydrogen  atom is 1s' (pronounced  “one ess one”). The superscript  1 indi-
cates that only one electron  is in the s orbital. The ground  state electron
configuration  for a helium  atom is 1s? (pronounced  “one ess two”), where
the superscript  2 indicates  that there are two electrons  in the s orbital. For
a lithium  atom, it is 1s?2s'. Again, the superscript  numbers  indicate  the
number  of electrons  in each of the orbitals.
When you are learning  to write electron  configurations,  it is helpful  to
start with the first element  in the periodic  table (hydrogen),  and “build
up” the electronic  structure  of its atom by adding  an electron  to its lowest
available  energy level. Then you move on to the next element  (helium)  by
adding a proton (and several  neutrons)  to the nucleus,  and by adding an
electron  to the appropriate  orbital. This imaginary  process  of building  up
the ground  state electronic  structure  for each atom, in order of atomic
number,  is called the aufbau  principle.  (Aufbau  comes from a German
word that means “to build up.”)

Writing  Electron  Configurations
Electron  configurations,  as they are used in this book, provide  information
about the first two quantum  numbers,  n and J. (Electron  configurations
may also reflect  the third quantum  number,  m), but this notation  goes
beyond  the scope of this chemistry  course.)  The electron  configuration
below  represents  a boron atom in its ground  state.

From the few examples  of electron  configurations  that you have seen so
far, you may have noticed  that they do not include  information  about
the spin direction  of the electron.  Once you have considered  the electron
configurations  for a variety  of atoms,  you will see that you can safely infer
where electrons  with opposite  spins have been paired  together.
There is, however,  a system  that chemists  use alongside  electron
configurations  to help them plot and keep track of electrons  in their
orbitals.  An orbital  diagram  uses a box for each orbital in any given
principal  energy  level. (Some chemists  use a circle or a line instead  of
a box.) An empty box | | represents  an orbital in which there are no
electrons  (an “unoccupied”  orbital).  A box that has an upward-pointing
arrow represents  an orbital  with an electron  that spins in one
direction.  A box with a downward-pointing  arrow | | |represents  an
orbital  with an electron  that spins in the opposite  direction.  You can
probably  surmise  that a box with oppositely  pointing  arrows
represents  a filled orbital.
You are nearly  ready to begin “building  up” the electronic  structures  of
the atoms,  using both electron  configurations  and orbital diagrams.  Below
you will find some guidelines  to help you. Refer to these guidelines  and
to Figure 3.19 as you work your way through  the information  that follows.
Guidelines  for “Filling”  Orbitals
1. Place electrons  into the orbitals  in order of increasing  energy  level.
2. Each set of orbitals  of the same energy  level must be completely
filled before proceeding  to the next orbital or series of orbitals.
3. Whenever  electrons  are added  to orbitals  of the same energy  sub-
level, each orbital  receives  one electron  before any pairing  occurs.
4. When electrons  are added singly  to separate  orbitals  of the same
energy,  the electrons  must all have the same spin.
Guidelines  3 and 4 together  comprise  what is known  as Hund’s  rule.
If you “obey”  Hund’s  rule, no two electrons  can have the same set of
quantum  numbers.  Thus, this rule follows  from Pauli’s  exclusion  principle.
Chapter  3 Atoms,  Electrons,  and Periodic  Trends * MHR_ 143
Writing  Electron  Configurations  for Periods  1 and 2
Below  are the electron  configurations  for atoms of the first ten elements,
along with their orbital  diagrams.
Figure 3.20 presents  the same basic information  about the first ten
elements,  arranged  in the form of the periodic  table. Using these electron
configurations,  orbital diagrams,  and Figure 3.20, you can probably  follow
the logic that leads to the electronic  structure  of each atom. As you
examine  and compare  this information,  note the following.
e The energy  of each orbital (or each group of orbitals)  increases  as you
move from left to right.
e Boron’s  fifth electron  must go into the 2p energy  sublevel.  Since / = 1,
my may be -1, 0, or +1. The fifth electron  can go into any of these
orbitals,  because  they all have the same energy.  When  you draw orbital
diagrams,  it is customary  to place the electron  in the first available  box,
from left to right.
e With carbon,  you must apply Hund’s  rule. In other words,  carbon’s  sixth
electron  must go into the next unoccupied  2p orbital.  (Experimental
evidence  confirms  that the spin of this sixth electron  is, in fact, the
same direction  as the fifth electron.)
e With oxygen,  as with helium’s  1s orbital  and beryllium’s  2s orbital,  the
last-added  (eighth)  electron  is paired  with a 2p electron  of opposite
spin. In other words,  the Pauli exclusion  principle  applies.

GETESEZT]  How orbitals  are filled for atoms of the first 10 elements  of the periodic  table
Electron  Configurations  and Orbital Diagrams  for Period  3
To write the electron  configurations  and draw the orbital  diagrams  for
atoms of Period  3 elements,  you follow  the same process  as for Period  2.
The practice  problems  below  give you the chance  to write and draw these
representations.  In doing so, you will observe  a pattern  that enables  you to
take a “shortcut”  in writing  electron  configurations.  As the atomic  number
increases,  electron  configurations  become  longer  and longer.  You know
that chemical  reactivity  depends  mainly  on an atom’s  valence  electrons:
the electrons  in the outermost-occupied  principle  energy  level. To
highlight  these electrons,  you can use a simplified  notation  called a
condensed  electron  configuration.  This notation  places the electron
configuration  of the noble gas of the previous  period  in square  brackets,
using its atomic  symbol  only. Then you continue  with the configuration  of
the next energy  level that is being filled.
The condensed  electron  configuration  for a nitrogen  atom, for
example,  is [He]2s?2p?.  The notation  [He] is used to represent  1s”. For a
sodium  atom (Z = 11), the condensed  electron  configuration  is [Ne]3s?.
Here, [Ne] represents,  1s?2s?2p®.  Be aware that condensed  electron
configurations  are simply  convenient  short forms. Thus, [Ne]3s! does not
mean that a sodium  atom is the same as a neon atom plus one electron.
Sodium  and neon are different  elements  because  the nuclei of their atoms
are completely  different.
6. Use the aufbau  principle  to write complete  electron  configurations
and complete  orbital diagrams  for atoms of the following  elements:
sodium,  magnesium,  aluminum,  silicon,  phosphorus,  sulfur, chlorine,
and argon (atomic  numbers  11 through  18).

same elements.

configuration  for the outermost  occupied  energy  levels of groups
2 (IIA), 13 (IIIA), 14 (IVA), 15 (VA), 16 (VIA), 17 (VIIA),  and 18 (VIIA).

Electron  Configurations  and Orbital Diagrams  for Period 4
You may have noticed  that period 3 ended with electrons  filling the 3p
energy  sublevel.  However,  when n = 3, / may equal 0, 1, and 2. Perhaps
you wondered  what happened  to the 3d orbitals  (/ = 2).
Electrons  do not start occupying  3d orbitals  until the 4s orbital is
filled. Therefore,  the 3d orbitals  are filled starting  in period  4. The reason
for this change  in the expected  orbital  filling order is that the 4s orbital
has a lower energy  than the 3d orbitals.  Remember  that usually  you fill
orbitals  in order of increasing  energy.  (If necessary,  refer to the Guidelines
for “Filling”  Orbitals  and Figure 3.19 to refresh  your memory.)
The chart below shows electron  configurations  and partial  orbital
diagrams  for the 18 elements  of period  4. You would  expect  the filling
pattern  shown  for potassium  (Z = 19) through  vanadium  (Z = 23).
However,  an unexpected  deviation  from the pattern  occurs  with chromi-
um (Z = 24). The same thing happens  with copper  (Z = 29). All other
configurations  for period  4 conform  to the aufbau  principle.
Why do Cr and Cu have electron  configurations  that are different  from
what you would  predict?  The guidelines  that you have been using state
that you fill orbitals  according  to increasing  energy.  In most cases, this
results  in the most stable ground  state configuration  for the atom.
Experimental  evidence  indicates,  however,  that some atoms achieve
greater  stability  with electron  configurations  that do not conform  to
predicted  patterns.  For chromium,  the greatest  ground  state stability
results  from a configuration  in which  its 4s and 3d orbitals  are half-filled.
For copper,  a half-filled  4s orbital  and a completely  filled set of 3d orbitals
gives the most stable configuration.  Similar  situations  arise for a number
of atoms in the remaining  periods.

Electron  Configurations  and the Periodic  Table
So far, you have “built up” atoms of the first 36 elements  of the periodic
table. There are more than 80 elements  still remaining.  You do not,
however,  have to build up atoms of these elements  to write their electron
configurations.  You can do it simply  by consulting  the periodic  table!
All you need is to recognize  the significance  of several  patterns.  You have
already  observed  many of these.
In the process  of examining  the patterns  outlined  below,  you will
learn the filling order for atoms of elements  in periods  5, 6, and 7. You
will also see why the shape and organization  of the periodic  table is a
direct consequence  of the electronic  structure  of the atoms.
Arranging  Elements  by Electron  Configurations
Figure 3.21 on the next page shows  the entire periodic  table, with certain
segments  colour-coded  and labelled  according  to the type of orbital  that
is being filled. If you built up an atom of every element,  filling orbitals  in
order of increasing  energy,  you would construct  a chart with precisely  this
shape and organization.  Figure 3.22 highlights  the filling order, and there-
fore the energy  order, of the orbitals  when you read the periodic  table
from left to right.
Elements  that appear  in the s block and the p block are called either
the main group elements  or the representative  elements.  Chemists  give
them these names  because,  collectively,  these elements  are representative
of a wide range of physical  and chemical  properties.  Among  the main
group elements,  for example,  you will find metals,  non-metals,  metalloids,

They mark the transition  from the p orbital  filling order to the d orbital

Patterns  Involving  Group  Numbers  and Period  Numbers
Elements  in a group have similar  chemical  properties  because  they have
similar  outer electron  configurations.  That is, they have the same number
of valence  electrons.  This observation  gives rise to three patterns  that you
can deduce  from the periodic  table.

e The n value of the highest  occupied  energy  level is the period  number.
For example,  atoms of elements  that have electrons  with n = 3 appear
in period 3. Atoms  of elements  that have electrons  with n = 6 appear  in
period  6.
e The square of the n value (n’) equals the total number  of orbitals  in
that energy  level. Furthermore,  since each orbital  may have a maximum
of two electrons,  the maximum  number  of electrons  in any principle
energy  level is 2n’. For example,  with n = 2, there are four orbitals:  one
2s orbital  and three 2p orbitals.  Squaring  the n value gives 2* = 4. The
total number  of electrons  in this energy  level is eight, given by 2n?.
Notice  that there are eight elements  in period  2. This is no coincidence.
Compare  this result with the next period.  Does the pattern  hold? For
period 3 elements,  n = 3. The number  of orbitals  is n? = 9. (Verify  that
for yourself.)  The number  of electrons  is 2n? = 18. However,  there are
only eight elements  in period  3. Why? The 4s orbital  has a lower energy
than the 3p orbitals,  and thus fills first. The 3d orbitals  fill after the 4s
orbitals.  Therefore,  there are 18 elements  in period  4. Recall that the 4f
orbitals  do not fill until after the 6s orbital  fills.

Summarizing  Characteristics  of s, p, d, and f Block Elements CONCEPT  CHECK
The s block includes  hydrogen,  helium,  and the elements  of groups
1 (IA) and 2 (IA). Valence  electrons  occupy  only the ns orbitals
in this block. Hydrogen  atoms and atoms of group 1 have partially  filled
s orbitals,  represented  by the general  electron  configuration  ns’. Helium
and atoms of group 2 elements  have  s orbitals  filled with the maximum
number  of valance  electrons,  represented  by the general  notation  ns’.
Because  s orbitals  can hold a total of two electrons,  the s block elements
span two groups.
The p block includes  elements  of groups  13 (IIIA) through  18 (VIIA).
Electron  configurations  of the p block atoms take the general  form ns*np*,
where a represents  a value ranging  from 1 to 6. Because  the three  p orbitals
can hold a maximum  of six electrons,  the p block elements  span six groups.
Unique  among  the p block elements  are the atoms of group 18 (VHIA)
elements:  the noble gases, renowned  for their chemical  stability.  Their
electron  configuration  takes the general  form ns*np*,  representing  a
ground  state outer energy  level with fully occupied  s and p orbitals.  The
stability  of this configuration  is a key factor that drives the formation  of
chemical  bonds.
The d block includes  all the transition  elements.  In general,  atoms of
d block elements  have filled ns orbitals,  as well as filled or partially  filled
d orbitals.  Generally,  the ns orbitals  fill before the (n — 1)d orbitals.
However,  there are exceptions  (such as chromium  and copper)  because
these two sublevels  are very close in energy,  especially  at higher  values
of n. Because  the five d orbitals  can hold a maximum  of ten electrons,  the LA tea

From the electron  configuration,  you can deduce  the energy  level of the

The d block elements  known
to nineteenth  century  chemists
posed a puzzle. Many of these
metals  were known to react
with neutral molecules.
In particular,  chemists
observed  that nickel could
bond with carbon monoxide.
The resulting  compound,
nickel tetracarbonyl,  Ni(CO),,
is a gas. At the time, the
nature of the bonding  in this
compound  was unexplainable.
Even so, chemists  could easily
produce  and decompose
Ni(CO)4.  The chemical
reactions  involved  were used
to purify nickel, and led to the
establishment  of a company
that later became  International
Nickel Company,  INCO.Continued  ...continued am ~
The configuration  for the valence  electrons,  s*, indicates  that stron-
tium is in group  2 (IIA). The value of 5 in 5s? tells you that strontium  is
in period 5. The notation  s* means that strontium’s  valence  electrons  fill
the s orbital.  Thus, strontium  must be in the s block.
Check Your Solution
All elements  in group  2 (IIA) have electron  configurations  that end with
the notation  s*. The link between  n value and period  number  is correctly
applied.  Strontium  has an electron  configuration  with the general

Electron  Configurations,  Atomic  Properties,  and Periodic  Trends
Electron  configurations—representations  of the electronic  structure  of
atoms—help  to determine  the atomic  and chemical  properties  of the
elements.  Properties  such as atomic  radius,  ionization  energy,  metallic
character,  and electron  affinity  are periodic.  That is, they follow  recurring
trends in the periodic  table. In a previous  chemistry  course,  you studied
these properties  and noted their general  trends.  With your newly
developed  understanding  of the periodic  table, you are in a position  to re-
examine  these properties  and consider  the exceptions  to the general
trends.  Before doing so, carry out the following  ThoughtLab,  which

The arrangement  of elements  in the periodic  table
is a direct consequence  of the allowed  values  for

Periodic  Trends  in Atomic  Radius
As you know, atoms are not solid spheres.  Their volumes  (the extent of
their orbitals)  are described  in terms of probabilities.  Nevertheless,  the
size of an atom — its atomic  radius  — is a measurable  property.  Chemists
can determine  it by measuring  the distance  between  the nuclei of bonded,
neighbouring  atoms. For example,  for metals,  atomic  radius  is half the
distance  between  neighbouring  nuclei  in a crystal  of the metal element.
For elements  that occur as molecules,  which  is the case for many non-
metals,  atomic  radius is half the distance  between  nuclei of identical
atoms that bonded  together  with a single covalent  bond. In Figure 3.23,
the radii of metallic  elements  represent  the radius of an atom in a metallic
crystal.  The radii of all other elements  represent  the radius of an atom of
the element  participating  in a single covalent  bond with one additional,
like atom.

significant  digits.)
152 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Figure 3.23 shows the periodic  trends  associated  with the atomic
radius.  You can see that atomic  radii generally  decrease  across a period.
Furthermore,  atomic  radii generally  increase  down a group. Two factors
affect differences  in atomic  radii.
One factor affecting  atomic  radii is changing  n. As n increases,  there
is a higher  probability  of finding  electrons  farther  from their nucleus.
Therefore,  the atomic  volume  is larger. In other words,  atomic  radius
tends to increase  with increasing  n, and decrease  with decreasing  n.
The other factor that affects  atomic  radii is changing  nuclear  charge  —
specifically,  the effective  nuclear  charge.  Effective  nuclear  charge  is the
net force of attraction  between  electrons  and the nucleus  they surround.
Only hydrogen’s  single electron  experiences  the full positive  charge of
its nucleus.  For hydrogen,  the nuclear  charge experienced  by the electron
is Z, its atomic  number.  For all other atoms,  the nuclear  charge  that any
given electron  experiences  is offset to some degree  by other electrons.
Depending  on the electron  density  between  the nucleus  and any
particular  electron,  the net force of attraction—the  effective  nuclear
charge,  Zerg — may be large or small.
As Zep increases,  electrons  are attracted  more strongly  to the nucleus,
and the size of the atom decreases.  As Zs decreases,  electrons  experience
a reduced  force of attraction,  and the size of the atom increases.  Valence
electrons,  especially,  experience  a smaller  Zr than inner electrons
because  the inner electrons  shield or screen  them from the attractive  force
of the nucleus.
For the main group elements,  the combined  influences  of n, Ze, and
this shielding  effect have the following  outcomes.
e n governs  the trend of increasing  atomic  radius down a group. Down  a
group, atoms of each subsequent  element  have one more level of inner
electrons,  increasing  the shielding  effect. Because  of the additional
shielding,  Z.,¢ for the valence  electrons  changes  only slightly.  The
increase  in atomic  size, therefore,  results  from the increasing  value of n.
e Zor governs  the trend of decreasing  atomic  radius across a period.
Across  a period,  atoms of each element  have one more electron  added
to the same outer energy  level — n does not change.  The shielding  effect
changes  only slightly.  However,  Ze changes  considerably.  The decrease
in atomic  size across a period,  therefore,  results  from increasing  Zosr.
The atoms of transition  elements  do not display  the same general  trend as
the main group elements.  A key reason  for this is that electrons  are added
to inner energy  levels  — the d orbitals  — rather  than to the outer energy
levels.  As a result,  Zee changes  relatively  little, so atomic  size remains
fairly constant.  In later chemistry  courses,  you will learn a more complete
explanation  for the atomic  radii of transition-element  atoms.
Periodic  Trends  in lonization  Energy
For the hydrogen  atom, the difference  in energy  between  n = 1 and n = co
represents  the energy  change  associated  with the complete  removal  of its
electron.  (By convention,  when n = oo, an electron  is considered  to be
completely  removed  from its atom.) The energy  needed  to completely
remove  one electron  from a ground  state gaseous  atom is called the
ionization  energy.  Energy  must be added  to the atom to remove  an
electron  in order to overcome  the force of attraction  exerted  on the
electron  by the nucleus.  Since multi-electron  atoms have two or more
electrons,  they also have more than one ionization  energy.
Chapter  3 Atoms,  Electrons,  and Periodic  Trends * MHR_ 153
| Figure 3.24 | Periodic  trends
involving  first ionization  energyA gaseous  atom’s  first ionization  energy  is the least energy  required  to
remove  an electron  from the outermost  occupied  energy  level. The second
ionization  energy  is always  greater  than the first ionization  energy,
because  the electron  must be removed  from a positively  charged  ion. The
same reasoning  applies  for successive  ionization  energies.
First ionization  energy  (IE,) is closely  linked  to an atom’s  chemical
reactivity.  Atoms  with a low IE, tend to form cations  during  chemical  reac-
tions. Notice  in Figure 3.24 that the atoms with the lowest  IE, are those
belonging  to group 1 elements.  These elements,  also known  as the alkali
metals,  are among  the most reactive  elements  in the periodic  table. Atoms
of elements  with high IE, tend to form anions:  negatively  charged  ions.
(A notable  exception  is the noble gases, which  do not form ions naturally.)

Figure 3.24 illustrates  several  trends associated  with ionization  energy.
e Ionization  energy  generally  decreases  down  a group.  Notice  that this
trend is the inverse  of the trend for atomic  radius.  The two trends are,
in fact, linked.  As atomic  radius  increases,  the distance  of valence
electrons  from the nucleus  also increases.  There is a decrease,  therefore,
in the force of attraction  exerted  by the nucleus  on the valence
electrons.  Thus, less energy  is needed  to remove  one such electron.
e Ionization  energy  generally  increases  across  a period.  Again,  this trend
is linked  to the atomic  radius.  Across  a period,  the atomic  radius
decreases  because  Zerrp increases.  The force of attraction  between  the
nucleus  and valence  electrons  is subsequently  increased.  Therefore,
more energy  is needed  to remove  one such electron.
Several  minor  variations  in these trends occur. The variations  involve
boron and aluminum  in group 13 (IIIA) and oxygen  and sulfur in group 16
(VIA). The drop in IE; with group 13 occurs  because  electrons  start to fill
the np orbitals.  These orbitals  are higher  in energy  than the ns orbital,  so
the additional  electron  is more easily removed.  Group 16 marks the first
pairing  of the p orbital  electrons.  The np* configuration  of nitrogen  is
more stable than the np* configuration  of oxygen.  Electron  repulsions
154 MHR »« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
increase  the orbital energy  in oxygen.  Therefore,  less energy  is required  to
remove  the fourth  p sublevel  electron  in oxygen.
Periodic  trends  in ionization  energy  are linked  to trends involving  the
reactivity  of metals.  In general,  the chemical  reactivity  of metals  increases
down a group and decreases  across a period.  These trends,  as well as a
further  trend from metallic  to non-metallic  properties  across a period,  and
increasing  metallic  properties  down a group, are shown  in Table 3.1.

Periodic  Trends  in Electron  Affinity
Electron  affinity  is the change  in energy  that occurs  when an electron  is
added  to a gaseous  atom. As was the case with ionization  energy,  there is
more than one value for electron  affinity.  The first electron  affinity  results
in the formation  of an anion with a charge  of 1-. For example,  when a
neutral  fluorine  atom acquires  an electron,  as in a bonding  situation,
the resulting  electron  configuration  of the fluoride  ion is the same as that
of the noble gas, neon:
F (1s72s?2p°)  + e@ > F (1s72s?2p®)  AE = EA,
Fluorine  is a highly  reactive  element.  The relative  ease with which
it gains an electron  when it forms bonds is reflected  in its high
electron  affinity.

High negative  numbers  mean  a high electron  affinity.  Low negative  num-

Trends  for electron  affinity  are more irregular  than those for atomic
radius and ionization  energy,  because  factors  other than atomic  size and
Zeft are involved.  In future chemistry  courses,  you will learn about these
factors  and how they explain  the irregularities.  However,  the property  of
electron  affinity  is still significant  when you consider  it in combination
with ionization  energy.  The trends  that result from this combination  are
important  for chemical  bonding.
e Atoms  of elements  in group 17 (VIIA),  and to a lesser degree  group 16
(VIA), have high ionization  energies  and high electron  affinities.  As
a result, it takes a great deal of energy  to remove  electrons  from these
atoms. However,  these atoms attract  electrons  strongly,  and form
negative  ions in ionic compounds.
156 MHR-» Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
e Atoms of elements  in group 1 (IA) and group  2 (IIA) have low ionization
energies  and low electron  affinities.  Atoms of these elements  give up
electrons  easily, but attract  them poorly.  Therefore,  they form positive
ions in ionic compounds.
e Atoms of elements  in group 18 (VIIA)  have very high ionization  ener-
gies and very low electron  affinities.  Therefore,  in nature,  they do not
gain, give up or share electrons  at all. (Under  laboratory  conditions,
only the larger group 18 atoms can be made to form compounds.)
Section  Summary
In this section,  you have seen howa theoretical  idea, the quantum
mechanical  model of the atom, explains  the experimentally  determined
structure  of the periodic  table, and the properties  of its elements.  Your
understanding  of the four quantum  numbers  enabled  you to write electron
configurations  and draw orbital diagrams  for atoms of the elements.  You
also learned  how to “read” the periodic  table to deduce  the electron  con-
figuration  of any element.
Since the start of high school science  courses,  you have used the
periodic  table to help you investigate  the composition  and behaviour  of
the elements.  Your early experiences  with the periodic  table were limited
largely  to the first 20 elements,  because  you could explain  their electron
structure  without  the concepts  of orbitals  and electron  configurations.
The modern,  quantum  mechanical  model of the atom has broadened
your understanding  of the elements,  the composition  of their atoms,
and their chemical  and physical  behaviour  in the world around  you.
You will draw upon these concepts  in the next chapter,  as you expand
your understanding  of the forces that are responsible  for the millions  of
kinds of matter  in the universe:  chemical  bonds.

about 25 elements  that do not exist in nature.

are members  of period 7. All are very dense
and radioactive.  Many, such as Rutherfordium
(Z = 104) and Bohrium  (Z = 107), are quite
short-lived,  with no known  applications
outside  of the laboratory.  An exception  is the
element  plutonium  (Z = 94). Research  several

These machines,  usually  the size of buildings,
are enormously  expensive  to build and operate.
Do you think this money  could be better spent
elsewhere?  Conduct  research  to help you exam-
ine this question  thoroughly  and thoughtfully.

Properties  of Substances
A water molecule has a bent shape, while a carbon dioxide molecule
is linear. An ammonia  molecule  looks like a pyramid,  and sulfur
hexafluoride  (one of the most dense and most stable gaseous  compounds)
is shaped  like an octahedron.  In fact, all molecules  in nature  have a
specific  shape, which  is important  to their chemistry.
Why does the shape of a molecule  matter?  To answer  this question,
consider  that, right now, each nerve cell in your brain is communicating
with adjacent  nerve cells by releasing  molecules  called neurotransmitters
from one cell to the next. Enzymes  are assisting  in the chemical  break-
down of food in your digestive  system.  The aroma of cologne,  desk wood,
or cleansers  that you may be smelling  is a result of odorous  molecules
migrating  from their sources  to specific  sites in your nasal passages.
Each of these situations  depends  on the ability  of one molecule  with a
specific  shape to “fit” into a precise  location  with a corresponding  shape.
The properties  of substances  derive from the ways in which particles
bond together,  the forces that act within  and among  the compounds  they
form, and the shapes  that result from these interactions.
In this chapter,  you will review  and extend  your understanding  of
chemical  bonding.  You will discover  how and why each molecule  has a
characteristic  shape, and how molecular  shape is linked  to the properties
of substances.  You will also consider  the importance  of molecular  shape
to the development  of materials  with specific  applications  in the world
around  you.

Chemical  Bonding
Of the more than one hundred  elements  that occur in nature or that have
been produced  synthetically,  only the noble gases exist naturally  as single,
uncombined  atoms. The atoms of all other elements  occur in some
combined  form, bonded  together.  Chemical  bonds  are electrostatic  forces
that hold atoms together  in compounds.
Why, however,  do atoms form bonds at all? The answer  to this
question  involves  energy.  In nature,  systems  of lower energy  tend to be
favoured  over systems  of higher  energy.  In other words,  lower-energy
systems  tend to have greater  stability  than higher-energy  systems.  Bonded
atoms,  therefore,  tend to have lower energy  than single,  uncombined
atoms.
Using Lewis Structures  to Represent  Atoms in Chemical  Bonding
Chemical  bonding  involves  the interaction  of valence  electrons—the
electrons  that occupy  the outermost  principal  energy  level of an atom.
You have used Lewis structures  in previous  studies  to indicate  the
valence  electrons  of atoms. Recall that to draw the Lewis structure  of an
atom, replace  its nucleus  and inner electrons  with its atomic  symbol.
Then add dots around  the atomic  symbol  to symbolize  the atom’s valence
electrons.  Many chemists  place the dots starting  at the top and continue
adding  dots clockwise,  at the right, then bottom,  then left. After you have
drawn  the first four dots, you begin again at the top, as shown  below.
Na Mg: Al’ ‘Si’ *P* °S: °Cl: :Ar:
In this chapter,  you will use Lewis structures  often to represent
molecules  and the simplest  formula  unit of an ionic solid. Drawing  a
Lewis structure  for a molecule  lets you see exactly  how many electrons
are involved  in each bond, and helps you to keep track of the number  of
valence  electrons.  In the example  below,  notice that there are two ways
to show the bonding  pairs of electrons.  Some chemists  use dots only.
Other chemists  show the bonding  pairs as lines between  atoms. Dots are
reserved  for representing  a Jone pair (a non-bonding  pair) of electrons.
You will see the second  example,  with lines for bonding  pairs, used more
often in this textbook.

You will be asked to identify  each substance  as

lonic Bonding
The force of attraction  between  oppositely  charged  ions (cations  and
anions)  constitutes  an ionic bond. Ionic bonding  occurs  between  atoms
of elements  that have large differences  in electronegativity  — usually  a
metal with a very low electronegativity  and a non-metal  with a very high
electronegativity.  The units of ionic compounds  such as sodium  chloride
and magnesium  fluoride  cannot  be separated  easily  by direct heating  of the
crystal  salts. The ions that make up the ionic solid are arranged  in a specif-
ic array of repeating  units. In solid sodium  chloride,  for example,  the ions
are arranged  in a rigid lattice structure.  In such systems,  the cations  and
anions  are arranged  so that the system  has the minimum  possible  energy.
Because  of the large differences  in electronegativity,  the atoms in an
ionic compound  usually  come from the s block metals  and the p block
non-metals.  For example,  magnesium  in Group  2 (ITA) and fluorine  in
Group 17 (VIIA) combine  to form the ionic compound  magnesium
fluoride,  MgF2. Figure 4.1 shows a repeating  unit in the crystal  model
of magnesium  fluoride.  The process  that results  in the formation  of ions
can be illustrated  with an orbital diagram  or with Lewis structures,  as
shown  in Figures  4.2 and 4.3. Use them as a guide for the Practice
Problems  below. Through  bonding,  the atoms of each element  obtain  a
valence  electron  configuration  like that of the nearest  noble gas. In this
case, the nearest  noble gas for both ions is neon. This observation  reflects
the octet rule.

Properties  of lonic Solids
Magnesium  fluoride  has many properties  that are characteristic  of ionic
solids. In general,  ionic solids have the following  properties:
e crystalline  with smooth,  shiny surfaces
e hard but brittle
e non-conductors  of electricity  and heat
e high melting  points
Many ionic solids are also soluble  in water. Magnesium  fluoride,  however,
is an exception.  It has a very low solubility  in water.
Lattice  Energy  and lonic Bonding
The reaction  between  gaseous  magnesium  ions and gaseous  fluorine  ions
is highly  exothermic.  Chemists  have determined  that 2957 kJ of energy  is
released  when 1 mol of Mg**) and 2 mol of F%) react to form 1 mol of
the stable ionic solid, MgF>.
The amount  of energy  given off when an ionic crystal  forms from the
gaseous  ions of its elements  is called the lattice energy.  Thus, the lattice
energy  of MgF. is 2957 kJ/mol.  The same amount  of energy  must be
added to break the ionic crystal  back into its gaseous  ions. What is the
relationship  between  lattice energy  and the formation  of an ionic bond?
For example,  when solid magnesium  and gaseous  fluorine  react to form
magnesium  fluoride,  the energy  change  is 1123 kJ/mol.  How does this
energy  change  relate to magnesium  fluoride’s  lattice energy  of 2957 kJ/mol?
Remember  that, in general,  the lower the total energy  of a system  is,
the higher  is its stability.  Any process  that requires  the addition  of energy
usually  decreases  the stability  of the ionic arrangement.  Any process
that gives off energy  usually  increases  that stability.  Ionic crystals  such
as magnesium  fluoride  have very high melting  points.  This means  that a
large amount  of energy  is required  to break  the bonds that hold the ions
together  in their rigid lattice structure.  You might wonder  if this energy
comes from the process  of ionization.  However,  this is not the case. The
ionization  energy  of the metal is always  larger than the electron  affinity  of
the non-metal.  In other words,  the transfer  of electrons  between  gaseous
ions always  requires  energy.  In fact, it is the lattice energy  given off
(2957 kJ/mol  for MgF,) that favours  the formation  of ionic bonds.
For magnesium  fluoride,  the overall  decrease  in energy  of 1123 kJ/mol
is accounted  for mainly  by its large lattice energy.  The lattice energies
of the magnesium  halides  decrease  from fluoride  to iodide.  The melting
points of these halides  reveal a trend in the same direction,  with magne-
sium fluoride  having  the highest  melting  point and magnesium  iodide
having  the lowest  melting  point. In other words,  the compound  with the
largest  lattice energy  has the highest  melting  point—it  requires  the most
energy  to disrupt  the lattice structure.

Covalent  Bonding
Covalent  bonding  involves  a balance  between  the forces of attraction
and repulsion  that act between  the nuclei and electrons  of two or
more atoms. This idea is represented  in Figure 4.4, with a molecule  of
hydrogen,  Hz. There is an optimum  separation  for two hydrogen  atoms
at which  their nucleus-electron  attractions,  nucleus-nucleus  repulsions,
and electron-electron  repulsions  achieve  this balance.  This optimum
separation  favours  a minimum  energy  for the system,  and constitutes  the
covalent  bond between  the two hydrogen  atoms. Unlike  ionic bonding,
in which  electrons  behave  as if they are transferred  from one atom to
another,  covalent  bonding  involves  the sharing  of pairs of electrons.
In Chapter  3 you learned  how the quantum  mechanical  model applies
to the atom. The model can also be extended  to explain  bonding.  A
covalent  bond may form when two half-filled  atomic  orbitals  from two
atoms overlap  to share the same region  of space. A covalent  bond involves
the formation  of a new orbital,  caused  by the overlapping  of atomic
orbitals.  The new orbital  has energy  levels that are lower than those of
the original  atomic  orbitals.  Since electrons  tend to occupy  the lowest
available  energy  level, the new orbitals  provide  a more energetically
favourable  configuration  than the two atoms had before they interacted.
Characteristics  of Covalent  Bonding
In many cases, electron-sharing  enables  each atom in a covalent  bond to
acquire  a noble gas configuration.  For a hydrogen  molecule,  each atom
acquires  a filled valence  level like that of helium  by treating  the shared
pair of electrons  as if it is part of its own composition.  As you can see in
Figure 4.5, a single shared  pair of electrons—a  bonding  pair—fills  the
valence  level of both hydrogen  atoms at the same time.
The period 2 non-metals  from carbon  to fluorine  must fill their 2s and
their three 2p orbitals  to acquire  a noble gas configuration  like that of
neon. Covalent  bonding  that involves  these elements  obeys the octet rule.
In the formation  of the diatomic  fluorine  molecule,  F,, for example,  the
bonding  (shared)  pair of electrons  gives each fluorine  atom a complete
valence  level.
bonding  pair | f lone pairs
°F OF | or
Each fluorine  atom also has three unshared  pairs of electrons.  These
pairs of electrons,  called Jone pairs, are not involved  in bonding.
The covalent  bond that holds molecules  of hydrogen,  fluorine,  and
hydrogen  fluoride  together  is a single bond. It involves  a single bonding
pair of electrons.  Some molecules  are bonded  together  with two shared
pairs of electrons.  These are called double  bonds. Carbon  dioxide  is an
example  of a covalent  molecule  that consists  of double  bonds.
O:C20 or O=C=0
Molecules  that are bonded  with three shared  pairs of electrons  have
triple bonds.  Nitrogen,  N2, another  diatomic  molecule,  is a triple-bonded
molecule.

You will see this symbol  again in
section  4.2.Bond energy  is the energy  required  to break the force of attraction
between  two atoms in a bond and to separate  them. Thus, bond energy
is a measure  of the strength  of a bond. You might expect  that the bond
energy  would  increase  if more electrons  were shared  between  two atoms
because  there would  be an increase  in charge density  between  the nuclei
of the bonded  atoms. In other words,  you might predict  that double  bonds
are stronger  than single bonds,  and that triple bonds are stronger  than
double  bonds. The data in Table 4.1 support  this prediction.

Predicting  lonic and Covalent  Bonds
There are several  methods  you can use to predict  the type of bond in
an unknown  substance.  For example,  you can consider  the substance’s
physical  properties.  In contrast  to ionic solids, covalent  (molecular)
compounds  typically  have the following  properties:
e exist as a soft solid, a liquid, or a gas at room temperature
e have low melting  points and boiling  points
e are poor conductors  of electricity,  even in solution
e may not be soluble  in water (acetone,  however,  is one of many
exceptions;  you will find out why shortly)
What if you know the formula  of a compound  but don’t know how
to classify  it? In this case, you can use the electronegativity  difference
between  the bonding  atoms to predict  the type of bond. For example,
two atoms with identical  electronegativities,  such as chlorine
(AEN = 3.16 — 3.16 = O) share their electrons  equally.  They are bonded
covalently.  When  two atoms have very different  electronegativities,  the
atom with the higher  electronegativity  value attracts  electrons  more
strongly  than the atom with the lower electronegativity  value. In sodium
chloride,  for instance,  chlorine  (EN = 3.16) attracts  an electron  much
more strongly  than sodium  (EN = 0.93). Therefore,  sodium’s  valence
electron  has a very high probability  of being found near chlorine,  and a
very low probability  of being found near sodium.  A high electronegativity
difference  is characteristic  of ionic compounds.
It is common  for chemists  to describe  the formation  of ionic
compounds  in terms of a transferring  of electrons  from one atom to
another.  For example,  in the formation  of sodium  chloride,  you often
read that sodium  loses its valence  electron  and that chlorine  gains an
electron.  Terms such as these—electron  transfer,  losing electrons,  gaining
electrons—make  it easier to discuss  and model the behaviour  of atoms
during  ionic bonding  and the formation  of ionic compounds.  Figure 4.6
provides  a guide to classifying  chemical  bonds based on their electronega-
tivity difference.  Notice  that this “bonding  continuum,”  as it is sometimes
called,  avoids  definitive  classifications.  Instead,  the character  of chemical
bonds changes  gradually  with AEN.
168 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Chemists  consider  bonded  atoms with AEN between  0 and 0.4 as
being mostly  covalent;  electrons  are shared  equally  or nearly equally.
For bonded  atoms that have AEN between  0.4 and 1.7, the bond is
termed  polar covalent.  A polar covalent  bond is a covalent  bond with
an unequally  shared  pair of electrons  between  two atoms. This unequal
sharing  results  in a bond that has partially  positive  and partially  negative
poles. (You will learn about the significance  of molecular  polarity  in
section  4.2.) Bonded  atoms with AEN between  1.7 and 3.3 are mostly
ionic; electrons  are shared  so unequally  that one bonded  atom has a
strong  negative  charge  and the other has a strong positive  charge.
The gradual  change  in the magnitude  of AEN between  two atoms
is paralleled  by a gradual  change  in the physical  properties  of the com-
pounds  they form. For example,  chlorine  forms compounds  with each of
the main-group  elements  of period  3, except  for argon. Figure  4.7 shows
the relationship  between  AEN and the bonding,  structure,  and properties
of the period 3 chlorides.Web LINK

Metallic  Bonding
About  two-thirds  of all the naturally  occurring  elements  are metals.
Despite  this great diversity,  metals  have many properties  in common.
Metals conduct  electricity  and heat in both their solid and liquid states.
Most metals are malleable  and ductile;  that is, they can be easily stretched,
bent, and deformed  without  shattering  of the whole solid, or can be easily
made to be with the addition  of heat or pressure.  While metals show a
broad range of melting  and boiling  points,  in general,  metals change  state
at moderate  to high temperatures.  Most metals have either one or two
valence  electrons.  What kind of bonding  model can account  for these
properties?
Based on electronegativity  differences,  you would not expect  metals
to form ionic bonds with themselves  or with other metals—and  they do
not. Similarly,  metals  do not have a sufficient  number  of valence  electrons
to form covalent  bonds with one another.  Metals  do, however,  share
electrons.  Unlike  the electron  sharing  in covalent  compounds,  however,
electron  sharing  in metals occurs throughout  the entire structure  of the
metal. The free-electron  model shown  in Figure 4.8 pictures  metals as
being composed  of a densely  packed  core of metallic  cations,  within  a
delocalized  region  of shared,  mobile  valence  electrons.  The force of
attraction  between  the positively  charged  cations  and the pool of valence
electrons  that moves among  them constitutes  a metallic  bond.
Properties  Explained  by the Free-Electron  Model
The free-electron  model explains  many properties  of metals. For example:
e Conductivity:  Metals  are good conductors  of electricity  and heat because
electrons  can move freely throughout  the metallic  structure.  This freedom
of movement  is not possible  in solid ionic compounds,  because  the
valence  electrons  are held within  the individual  ionic bonds in the lattice.
e Malleability  and Ductility:  The malleability  of metals can be explained
by viewing  metallic  bonds as being non-directional.  The positive  ions
are often layered  as fixed arrays (like soldiers  lined up for inspection).
When stress is applied  to a metal, one layer of positive  ions can slide
over another  layer. The layers move without  breaking  the array, which  is
the reason  why metals do not shatter  immediately  along  a clearly
170 MHR-» Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
defined  point of stress. The delocalized  electrons  continue  to exert a
uniform  attraction  on the positive  ions, as you can see in Figure 4.9.
e Melting  and Boiling  Points:  The melting  and boiling  points of Group 1
(IA) metals (with an s’ electron  in their condensed  electron  configura-
tion) are generally  lower than the melting  and boiling  points of Group 2
(IIA) metals (with an s? in their condensed  electron  configuration).
You would expect  this trend, because  the greater  number  of valence
electrons  and the larger positive  charge of Group 2 (IIA) atoms result in
stronger  metallic  bonding  forces. This trend is also consistent  with the
fact that Group 2 metals  are smaller  in size than Group 1 metals.  Trends
involving  the transition  metals  are more complex,  in part because  they
have a greater  number  of unpaired  electrons  in their d-orbitals.  Because
these d electrons  and those of the valence  energy  level have similar
magnitudes,  the d electrons  can participate  in metallic  bonding.  In
general,  however,  transition  elements  have very high melting  and
boiling  points.

of electrons,  produce  molecules  with characteristic  shapes.  These shapes,

Molecular  Shape and Polarity
A molecule  is a discrete  chemical  entity, in which  atoms are held together
by the electrostatic  attractions  of covalent  bonds. In previous  chemistry
courses,  you used Lewis structures  to represent  the bonding  in simple
molecules.  In a Lewis structure,  you assume  that each of the atoms in
the molecule  achieves  a noble gas configuration  through  the sharing  of
electrons  in single, double,  or triple bonds. This section  introduces  you
to a systematic  approach  to drawing  Lewis structures  for a broader  range
molecules  and for polyatomic  ions. You will see that, in some cases, there
are exceptions  to the octet rule. Afterwards,  you will use bonding  theory
to help you predict  the shapes  of various  molecules.  From the shapes  of
these molecules  (and the electronegativity  difference  of their atoms),  you
will determine  the polarity  of the substances  that are comprised  of these
molecules.
Why is polarity  important?  It explains  why, for example,  water is a
liquid at room temperature,  rather  than a gas. In other words,  it helps
explain  why Earth is capable  of supporting  life! You will explore  the
significance  of molecular  polarity  in greater  detail in section  4.3.
Lewis Structures  for Molecules  and Polyatomic  lons
You can use the procedure  outlined  below  to draw the Lewis structures
for molecules  and ions that have a central  atom, with other atoms around
it. The Sample  Problems  and additional  text that follow  show how to
apply these steps for several  molecules  and polyatomic  ions that obey the
octet rule. Afterwards,  use Practice  Problems  9 to 13 to practice  drawing
Lewis structures.
How To Draw Lewis Structures  for Simple  Molecules  and lons with
a Central  Atom
Step1 Position  the least electronegative  atom in the centre of the
molecule  or polyatomic  ion. Write the other atoms around  this
central  atom, with each atom bonded  to the central  atom by a
single bond. Always  place a hydrogen  atom or a fluorine  atom
at an end position  in the structure.
Step 2 (a) Determine  the total number  of valence  electrons  in the
molecule  or ion. For polyatomic  ions, pay close attention
to the charge.  For example,  if you are drawing  a polyatomic
anion such as CO,”, add two electrons  to the total number
of valence  electrons  calculated  for the structure  CO3. For a
polyatomic  cation such as NH,*, subtract  one electron  from
the total number  of valence  electrons  calculated  for the
structure  NH,.
(b) Once you have the total number  of valence  electrons,
determine  the total number  of electrons  needed  for each
atom to achieve  a noble gas electron  configuration.4.2

Step 3(c) Subtract  the first total (number  of valence  electrons)  from the
second  total (number  of electrons  needed  to satisfy  the octet
rule) to get the number  of shared  electrons.  Then divide  this
number  by 2 to give the number  of bonds.  Double  or triple
bonds  may be needed  to account  for this number  of bonds.
Double  bonds count as two bonds.  Triple bonds count as
three bonds.
Subtract  the number  of shared  electrons  from the number  of
valence  electrons  to get the number  of non-bonding  electrons.
Add these electrons  as lone pairs to the atoms surrounding
the central  atom so that you achieve  a noble gas electron
configuration  for each atom.

\Problem
Draw the Lewis structure  for formaldehyde  (methanal),  CH20.
Solution
The molecular  formula,  CH,O, tells you the number  of each kind
of atom in the molecule.  Following  steps 1 to 3 from the procedure
outlined  above:
Since H is always  placed  at the end position  and C is less
electronegative  than O, C should  be the central  atom. Place
the other atoms around  C, attached  by single bonds.
O
H—C—H
Determine  the total number  of valence  electrons:
(1 C atom x 4 e/C atom) + (1 O atom x 6 e/O atom)
+ (2 H atoms x 1 e /H atom)
=4e +6e +2e€
=12¢e
Then, determine  the total number  of electrons  required  for each
atom in the structure  to achieve  a noble gas configuration.  This
would  be 8 e for C and 8 e for O (to fill their respective  valence
energy  levels) and 2 e for each H (to fill its 1s orbital).  So the total
number  for CH20O is:
(2 atoms x 8 e /atom)  + (2 atoms x 2 e /atom)  = 20 e&
To find the number  of shared  electrons,  subtract  the first total
from the second,
20e -—12e  =8e
Now divide  the number  of shared  electrons  by two to obtain  the
number  of bonds.
20e —12e  =8e +2=4 covalent  bonds
Since there are only three atoms surrounding  the central  atom,
you can infer that one of the bonds is likely a double  bond.

Co-ordinate  Covalent  Bonds
You know that a covalent  bond involves  the sharing  of a pair of electrons
between  two atoms; each atom contributes  one electron  to the shared  pair.
In some cases, such as the hydronium  ion, H3;0*, one atom contributes
both of the electrons  to the shared  pair. The bond in these cases is called
a co-ordinate  covalent  bond. In terms of the quantum  mechanical  model,  a
co-ordinate  covalent  bond forms whena filled atomic  orbital overlaps  with
an empty  atomic  orbital.  Once a co-ordinate  bond is formed,  it behaves  in
the same way as any other single covalent  bond. The next Sample  Problem
involves  a polyatomic  ion with a co-ordinate  covalent  bond.

provides  each shared  pair of electrons  around  the central  nitrogen  atom.
However,  the quantum  mechanical  model of the atom can explain  the
bonding  around  this nitrogen  atom. The condensed  electron  configuration
for nitrogen  is [Ne] 2s?2p*.  Each nitrogen  atom has only three unpaired
2p electrons  in three half-filled  orbitals  available  for bonding.  Since there
are four covalent  bonds shown  around  nitrogen  in the Lewis structure,
electrons  in one of the bonds must have come from the filled orbitals  of
nitrogen.  Therefore,  one of the bonds around  the central  nitrogen  atom

Imagine  that you are asked to draw the Lewis structure  for sulfur dioxide,
SO,. A typical  answer  would  look like this:
:O—S=0:
This Lewis structure  suggests  that SO, contains  a single bond and
a double  bond. However,  experimental  measurements  of bond lengths
indicate  that the bonds between  the S and each  O are identical.  The two
bonds have properties  that are somewhere  between  a single bond and a
double  bond. In effect, the SO, molecule  contains  two “one-and-a-half”
bonds.
To communicate  the bonding  in SO, more accurately,  chemists
draw two Lewis structures  and insert a double-headed  arrow between
them. Each of these Lewis structures  is called a resonance  structure.
Resonance  structures  are models  that give the same relative  position  of
atoms as in Lewis structures,  but show different  places for their bonding
and lone pairs.
176 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Many molecules  and ions—especially  organic  ones—require
resonance  structures  to represent  their bonding.  It is essential  to bear
in mind, however,  that resonance  structures  do not exist in reality.  For
example,  SO; does not shift back and forth from one structure  to the
other. An actual SO, molecule  is a combination—a  hybrid—of  its two
resonance  structures.  It is more properly  referred  to as a resonance  hybrid.
You could think of resonance  hybrids  as being like “mutts.”  For example,
a dog that is a cross between  a spaniel  and a beagle (a “speagle”)  is part
spaniel  and part beagle.  It does not exist as a spaniel  one moment  and a
beagle the next. Instead,  a speagle  is an average,  of sorts, between  the two
breeds.  Similarly,  a resonance  hybrid  is a weighted  average  between  two
or more resonance  structures.

Central  Atoms  with an Expanded  Valence  Level
The octet rule allows a maximum  of four bonds (a total of eight electrons)
to form around  an atom. Based upon bond energies,  however,  chemists
have suggested  that the bonding  in some molecules  (and polyatomic  ions)
is best explained  by a model that shows more than eight electrons  in the
valence  energy  level of the central  atom. This central  atom is said to have
an expanded  valence  energy  level. One example  of a molecule  with an
expanded  valence  energy  level is phosphorus  pentachloride,  PCl;. This
substance  is a pungent,  pale-yellow  powder  that is used in the agricultural,
pharmaceutical,  and dyeing  industries.  Organic  chemists  also use reactions
with PC]; to identify  compounds  that contain  hydroxyl  groups.

Until recently,  chemists  explained  bonding  in molecules  such as PCI5
by assuming  that empty  d orbitals  of the central  atom were involved.
However,  experimental  evidence  does not support  this idea. Current
thinking  suggests  that larger atoms can accommodate  additional  valence
electrons  because  of their size. The theory  behind  this idea goes beyond
the scope of this textbook.  Assume  that the octet rule usually  applies
when drawing  Lewis structures  for simple  molecules.  Sometimes,
however,  you must violate  the rule to allow for more than four bonds
around  a central  atom.

Shapes  and Polarity  of Molecules
Up to now, you have represented  molecules  using Lewis structures.
These two-dimensional,  formula-like  diagrams  help you count and keep
track of valence  electrons,  and communicate  essential  information  about
the placement  and bonding  of atoms or ions in a molecule.  Chemists  often
draw Lewis structures  in a way that suggests  the shape of a molecule.
However,  this is not their function.  It is important  to remember  that Lewis
structures  do not communicate  any information  about a molecule’s  shape.
To represent  the shapes  of real molecules,  you need a model  that depicts
them in three-dimensions.
In 1957, an English  chemist,  Ronald  Gillespie,  joined  Hamilton,
Ontario’s  McMaster  University  for a long, distinguished  career as a
professor  of chemistry.  Earlier  that year, Gillespie,  in collaboration  with
a colleague,  Ronald  Nyholm,  developed  a model for predicting  the shape
of molecules.  Like chemistry  students  around  the world since that time,
you are about to learn the central  features  of this model,  called  the
Valence-Shell  Electron-Pair  Repulsion  theory.  This is usually  abbreviated
to VSEPR  (pronounced  “vesper”)  theory.  (Note that some chemists  use the
term “shell”  instead  of energy  level to describe  atomic  orbitals.)
Introducing  Valence-Shell  Electron-Pair  Repulsion  (VSEPR)  Theory
The fundamental  principle  of the Valence-Shell  Electron-Pair  Repulsion
theory  is that the bonding  pairs and lone, non-bonding  pairs of electrons
in the valence  level of an atom repel one another.  As you know, electron
pairs of atoms are localized  in orbitals,  which  are shapes  that describe  the
space in which  electrons  are most likely to be found around  a nucleus.
The orbital  for each electron  pair is positioned  as far apart from the other
orbitals  as possible.
178 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
The effect of this positioning  minimizes  the forces of repulsion
between  electron  pairs. A lone pair (LP) will spread  out more than a bond
pair. Therefore,  the repulsion  is greatest  between  lone pairs (LP— LP).
Bonding  pairs (BP) are more localized  between  the atomic  nuclei,  so they
spread  out less than lone pairs. Therefore,  the BP-BP  repulsions  are smaller
than the LP—LP  repulsions.  The repulsion  between  a bond pair and a
lone-pair  (BP—LP)  has a magnitude  intermediate  between  the other two.
In other words,  in terms of decreasing  repulsion:
LP—LP  > LP—BP  > BP—BP.
In Unit 1, you encountered  the tetrahedral  shape around  a single-
bonded  carbon  atom, the trigonal  planar  shape around  a carbon  atom
with one double  bond, and the linear shape around  a carbon  atom with
a triple bond. These shapes  result from repulsions  between  lone pairs
and bonding  pairs of electrons. Now you will use your understanding  of
LP and BP repulsions  to explain  the shapes  you learned  in Unit 1, and
to predict  the shapes  of other molecules.  Figure  4.11 shows  the five basic
geometrical  arrangements  that result from the interactions  of lone pairs
and bonding  pairs around  a central  atom. These arrangements  involve  up
to six electron  groups.  An electron  group is usually  one of the following:
e a single bond
e a double  bond
e a triple bond
e a lone pair
Each of the electron-group  arrangements  in Figure 4.11 results  in a
minimum  total energy  for the molecule.  Variations  in these arrangements
are possible,  depending  on whether  a bonding  pair or a lone pair occupies
a specific  position.  Therefore,  it is important  to distinguish  between
electron-group  arrangement  and molecular  shape. Electron-group
arrangement  refers to the ways in which  groups  of valence  electrons
are positioned  around  the central  atom. Molecular  shape refers to the
relative  positions  of the atomic  nuclei  in a molecule.  When all the
electron  groups  are bonding  pairs, a molecule  will have one of the five
geometrical  arrangements  shown  in Figure  4.11. If one or more of the
electron  groups  include  a lone pair of electrons,  variations  in one of the
five geometric  arrangements  result.~~ a

Molecular  Geometry
Each of the molecules  in Figure 4.12 has four pairs of electrons  around
the central  atom. Observe  the differences  in the number  of bonding  and
lone pairs in these molecules.  Methane,  CH,, has four BPs. Ammonia,
NH3, has three BPs and one LP. Water,  H,O, has two BPs and two LPs.
Notice  the effect of these differences  on the shapes  and bond angles of
the molecules.  Methane,  with four BPs, has a molecular  shape that is the
same as the electron-group  arrangement  in which  four electron  groups
surround  a central  atom: tetrahedral.  The angle between  any two bonding
pairs in the tetrahedral  electron-group  arrangement  is 109.5°. This angle
corresponds  to the most favourable  arrangement  of electron  groups  to
minimize  the forces of repulsion  among  them.

GEEEL  EEA Comparing  the bond angles in the molecules  of CH,, NH3, and H,0.
When  there are 1 LP and 3 BPs around  a central  atom, there are two
types of repulsions:  LP—-BP  and BP—BP.  Since LP—BP repulsions  are
greater  than BP —BP repulsions,  the bond angle between  the bond pairs
in NH; is reduced  from 109.5° to 107.3°.  When  you draw the shape of a
trigonal  pyramidal  molecule,  without  the lone pair, you can see that the
three bonds form the shape of a pyramid  with a triangular  base. In a
molecule  of H,O, there are two BPs and two LPs. The strong LP— LP
repulsions,  in addition  to the LP—BP  repulsions,  cause the angle
between  the bonding  pairs to be reduced  further  to 104.5°.  You encoun-
tered this variation  of the tetrahedral  shape in Unit 1: the bent shape
around  an oxygen  atom with 2 LPs and two single bonds.
Table 4.2 summarizes  the molecular  shapes  that commonly  occur. The
VSEPR  notation  used for these shapes  adopts  the letter “A” to represent
the central  atom, the letter “X” to represent  a bonding  pair, and the letter
“h’ to represent  a lone pair of electrons.  For example,  the VSEPR  notation
for NH3 is AX3E. This indicates  that ammonia  has three BPs around  its

equatorial  region (yellow)
experiences  two repulsions  at

between  electron  pairs are
much greater  when 90° apart
as compared  to 120°. Therefore,
repulsions  in the equatorial

For example,  what if you were asked to predict  the molecular  shape of

AIM Theory  and Electron
Density  Maps
The microscopic  world of atoms is difficult  to
imagine,  let alone visualize  in detail. Chemists  and
chemical  engineers  employ  different  molecular
modelling  tools to study  the structure,  properties,
and reactivity  of atoms,  and the way they bond to
one another.  Richard  Bader, a chemistry  professor  at
McMaster  University,  has invented  an interpretative
theory  that is gaining  acceptance  as an accurate
method  to describe  molecular  behaviour  and predict
molecular  properties.  According  to Dr. Bader, shown
below,  small molecules  are best represented  using
topological  maps, where contour  lines (which are
commonly  used to represent  elevation  on maps)
represent  the electron  density  of molecules.
The diagrams  above show two different  ways to model the
electron  density  in a plane of a molecule  of ethylene  .
186 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and PropertiesIn the early 1970s, Dr. Bader invented  the
theory  of “Atoms  in Molecules,”  otherwise  known
as AIM theory.  This theory  links the mathematics
of quantum  mechanics  to the atoms and bonds in
a molecule.  AIM theory  adopts  electron  density,
which is related  to the Schrodinger  description  of
the atom, as a starting  point to mapping  molecules.
Chemists  often focus on the energetic,
geometric,  and spectroscopic  properties  of
molecules.  However,  since the electron  density
exists in ordinary  three-dimensional  space, electron
density  maps of molecules  can be used as tools to
unearth  a wealth of information  about the molecule.
This information  includes,  but is not limited  to, a
molecule’s  magnetic  properties,  per-atom  electron
population,  and bond types.
Using diagrams  and computer  graphics,  chemists
use AIM theory  to construct  three-dimensional
electron  density  maps of molecules.  Chemists  can
then use the maps as tools to perform  experiments
on the computer  as if they were performing  the
same experiments  in the laboratory,  but with higher
efficiency.  Many chemists  are excited  by the prospect
of using computer  graphics,  both inside and outside
of the classroom,  as teaching  tools for students  and
the public  at large.
In addition  to being able to simulate  very
simple  isolated  molecules  and their reactions,
AIM theory  provides  a physical  basis for the theory
of Lewis electron  pairs and the VSEPR  model of
molecular  geometry.  Equipped  with computers  and
computer-generated,  three-dimensional  electron
density  maps, scientists  are able to view molecules
and predict  molecular  phenomena  without  even
having  to get off their chairs!
The Relationship  Between  Molecular  Shape and Molecular  Polarity
A molecule’s  shape and polarity  are directly  related.  As you know, the
electronegativity  difference  between  two atoms is the principal  factor
that determines  the type of chemical  bonding  between  them. As you saw
in section  4.1, when atoms of two different  elements  have AEN between
0.5 and 1.7, the bond between  them is polar covalent.  The electrons  are
shared  unequally  between  the two types of atoms. For example,  in the
HCl molecule,  the Cl atom is more electronegative  than the H atom. Thus,
the Cl atom exerts a stronger  force of attraction  on the shared  pair of
electrons.  As a result, the Cl end of the bond develops  a partial  negative
charge (6°) and the H end develops  a partial  positive  charge (6*). This
polarity  in a bond is called a bond dipole.  The vector  used to represent  a
bond dipole  points toward  the more electronegative  element.  For exam-
ple, you could represent  the polarity  of the bond in hydrogen  chloride  as:
* 8 to
H: Cl: or HCI
For a diatomic  molecule  such as HCl, or the bond polarity  is also the
molecule’s  polarity.  For polyatomic  molecules,  such as the examples  that
follow,  molecular  polarity  depends  on the polarity  of all of the bonds and
the angles at which  the dipoles  come together.  Thus, molecular
dipole— or just dipole—is  a term used to describe  the charge  separation
for the entire molecule.
Consider,  for example,  BeF:, which  is a symmetrical,  linear  molecule.
Each Be—F  bond is polar (because  fluorine  has a greater  electronegativity
than beryllium).  Due to the linear shape of this molecule,  however,
the polarities  of the two bonds are directly  opposite  each other. The
two bonding  polarities  exactly  counteract  each other, so that BeF, is a
non-polar  molecule.  The shape of a molecule,  combined  with the polarity
of its individual  bonds,  therefore,  determine  polarity.

mine the structure  and polarity  of molecules.  Why is the polarity  of a
molecule  important?  Polar molecules  attract one another  more than non-
polar molecules  do. Because  of this attraction,  many physical  properties
of substances  are affected  by the polarity  of their molecules.  In the next
section,  you will consider  some of these physical  properties  for liquid and
solid substances,  and learn about other forces that have a significant  effect

in Liquids  and Solids
Water and hydrogen  sulfide  have the same molecular  shape:  bent. Both
are polar molecules.  However,  H2,O, with a molar mass of 18 g, is a liquid
at room temperature,  while H2S, with a molar mass of 34 g, is a gas.
Water’s  boiling  point is 100°C, while hydrogen  sulfide’s  boiling  point
is -61°C. These property  differences  are difficult  to explain  using the
bonding  models  you have learned  so far. These models  focused  on the
forces of attraction  between  ions in ionic solids,  between  individual  atoms
in covalent  and polar covalent  compounds,  and between  positive  metal
ions and free electrons  in metals.  These are intramolecular  forces—forces
exerted  within  a molecule  or polyatomic  ion. During  a chemical  change,
intramolecular  forces are overcome  and chemical  bonds  are broken.
Therefore,  these forces influence  the chemical  properties  of substances.
Forces  that influence  the physical  properties  of substances  are called
intermolecular  forces. These are forces of attraction  and repulsion  that act
between  molecules  or ions.
Intermolecular  forces were extensively  studied  by the Dutch  physicist
Johannes  van der Waals (1837-1923).  To mark his contributions  to the
understanding  of intermolecular  attractions,  these forces are often called
van der Waals forces. They are categorized  into the following  groups:
dipole-dipole  forces, ion-dipole  forces, induced  dipole forces, dispersion
(London)  forces, and hydrogen  bonding.  In the pages that follow,  you will
see how each of these types of intermolecular  forces affects  the molecular
properties  of liquids.  Following  that, you will apply your understanding
of intermolecular  forces to help you explain  some physical  properties  of
substances  in the solid state.
Dipole-Dipole  Forces
In the liquid state, polar molecules  (dipoles)  orient themselves  so that
oppositely  charged  ends of the molecules  are near to one another.  The
attractions  between  these opposite  charges  are called dipole-dipole  forces.
Figure 4.13 shows  the orientation  of polar molecules  due to these forces
in a liquid.
GGETTEL SE} Dipole-dipole  forces among polar molecules  in the liquid state
190 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
As a result of these dipole-dipole  forces of attraction,  polar molecules
will tend to attract  one another  more at room temperature  than similarly
sized non-polar  molecules  would.  The energy  required  to separate  polar
molecules  from one another  is therefore  greater  than that needed  to sepa-
rate non-polar  molecules  of similar  molar mass. This is indicated  by the
extreme  difference  in melting  and boiling  points of these two types of
molecular  substances.  (Recall  that melting  and boiling  points  are physical
properties  of substances.)CONCEPT  CHECK
Acetaldehyde  (ethanal),
CH3CHO,  is a polar molecule
that has a boiling point of 20°C.
Propane,  on the other hand, is
a non-polar  molecule  of similar
size, number  of electrons,  and
molar mass. The boiling point
of propane,  CH3CH2CHs,  is
—42°C. Use the concept  of
dipole-dipole  forces  to explain
these property  differences.lon-Dipole  Forces
Sodium  chloride  and other soluble  ionic solids dissolve  in polar solvents
such as water because  of ion-dipole  forces.  An ion-dipole  force is the
force of attraction  between  an ion and a polar molecule  (a dipole).  For
example,  NaCl dissolves  in water because  the attractions  between  the Nat
and Cl ions and the water molecules  provide  enough  energy  to overcome
the forces that bind the ions together.  Figure 4.14 shows how ion-dipole
forces dissolve  any type of soluble  ionic compound.
» @ ae |
In aqueous  solution,  ionic solids  dissolve  as the negative  ends and the positive
ends of the water molecules  become  oriented  with the corresponding  oppositely  charged  ions
that make up the ionic compound,  pulling  them away  from the solid into solution.
Induced  Intermolecular  Forces
Induction  of electric  charge occurs  when a charge on one object causes  a
change  in the distribution  of charge on a nearby  object. Rubbing  a balloon
to make it "stick"  to a wall is an example  of charging  by induction.  There
are two types of charge-induced  dipole forces.
An ion-induced  dipole  force results  when an ion in close proximity
to a non-polar  molecule  distorts  the electron  density  of the non-polar
molecule.  The molecule  then becomes  momentarily  polarized,  and the
two species  are attracted  to each other. This force is active during  every
moment  of your life, in the bonding  between  non-polar  Oz molecules
and the Fe** ion in hemoglobin.  Ion-induced  dipole forces, therefore,  are
part of the process  that transports  vital oxygen  throughout  your body.
A dipole-induced  dipole  force is similar  to that of an ion-induced
dipole force. In this case, however,  the charge on a polar molecule  is
responsible  for inducing  the charge on the non-polar  molecule.  Non-polar
gases such as oxygen  and nitrogen  dissolve,  sparingly,  in water  because  of
dipole-induced  dipole forces.
Chapter  4 Structures  and Properties  of Substances  * MHR_ 191
Dispersion  (London)  Forces
The shared  pairs of electrons  in covalent  bonds are constantly  vibrating.
While  this applies  to all molecules,  it is of particular  interest  for mole-
cules that are non-polar.  The bond vibrations,  which  are part of the
normal  condition  of a non-polar  molecule,  cause momentary,  uneven
distributions  of charge.  In other words,  a non-polar  molecule  becomes
slightly  polar for an instant,  and continues  to do this on a random  but
on-going  basis. At the instant  that one non-polar  molecule  is in a slightly
polar condition,  it is capable  of inducing  a dipole in a nearby  molecule.
An intermolecular  force of attraction  results.  This force of attraction  is
called a dispersion  force. Chemists  also commonly  refer to it as a London
force, in honour  of the German  physicist,  Fritz London,  who studied
this force. Unlike  other intermolecular  forces, dispersion  (London)
forces act between  any particles,  polar or otherwise.  They are the main
intermolecular  forces that act between  non-polar  molecules,  as shown  in
Figure  4.15.
Two factors  affect the magnitude  of dispersion  forces. One is the
number  of electrons  in the molecule  and the other is the shape of the
molecule.  Vibrations  within  larger molecules  that have more electrons
than smaller  molecules  can easily cause an uneven  distribution  of charge.
The dispersion  forces between  these larger molecules  are thus stronger,
which  has the effect of raising  the boiling  point for larger molecules.  A
molecule  with a spherical  shape has a smaller  surface  area than  a straight
chain molecule  that has the same number  of electrons.  The smaller
surface  area allows  less opportunity  for the molecule  to induce  a charge
on a nearby  molecule.  Therefore,  for two substances  with molecules  that
have a similar  number  of electrons,  the substance  with molecules  that
have a more spherical  shape will have weaker  dispersion  forces and a
lower  boiling  point.

GETEEZEEY  How dispersion  forces develop  between  identical  non-polar  molecules.  In A,
neither  molecule  interacts  with the other. In B, one molecule  becomes,  instantaneously,  a
dipole.  At that moment,  the dipolar  molecule  is able to induce  a temporary  charge  separation
in the other molecule,  resulting  in a force of attraction  between  the two. All the molecules
within a sample  undergo  this same process,  as shown in C.
Hydrogen  Bonding
A dipole-dipole  interaction  that is very significant  in many biological
molecules  and some inorganic  molecules,  such as HO),  is hydrogen
bonding.  Hydrogen  bonding  is a particularly  strong  form of dipole-dipole
attraction  that exists between  a hydrogen  atom in a polar-bonded
molecule  that contains  bonds such as H—O,  H—N,  or H—F, and an
unshared  pair of electrons  on another  small, electronegative  atom such
as O, N, or F. The small, electronegative  atom can be on its own, but is
usually  bonded  in a molecule.
192 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
When  hydrogen  is bonded  to oxygen,  fluorine,  or nitrogen,  the strong
force of attraction  exerted  by any of these three very electronegative  atoms
draws  the electron  density  from the hydrogen  atom in the polar-bonded
molecule,  leaving  the hydrogen  atom with a partial  positive  charge.  This
dipole  is easily attracted  to the partially  negative  lone pair on a nearby
electronegative  atom: N, O, or F.
You can see the effect of hydrogen  bonding  clearly  in the boiling
point data of the binary  hydrides  of Groups  14 to 17 (IVA to VIIA), shown
in Figure  4.16. In Group 14, the trend in boiling  point is as expected.
The increase  in boiling  point from methane,  CHa, to tin(IV) hydride,
SnHy,, is due to an increase  in the number  of electrons.  Therefore,  there
are larger dispersion  forces,  since more electrons  are able to temporarily
shift from one part of the molecule  to another.  In SnHu, this results  in
greater  intermolecular  forces of attraction.  There is no hydrogen  bonding
in these substances,  because  there are no lone pairs on the molecules.
However,  the hydrides  of Groups  15, 16, and 17 (VA to VIIA) only
show the expected  trend based on dispersion  forces for the larger mass
hydrides.  The smallest  mass hydrides,  NH3, H2O, and HF, have relatively
high boiling  points,  indicating  strong intermolecular  forces caused  by
hydrogen  bonding.
Why is there no hydrogen  bonding  in H2S and H2Se, which  have
unshared  electron  pairs on their central  atoms?  Neither  S nor Se is small
enough  or electronegative  enough  to support  hydrogen  bonding.  Thus,
H,0 (with its small and very electronegative  O atom) has a much higher
boiling  point than H,S and H,Se, as you can see in Figure 4.16.

CONCEPT  CHECK
How is hydrogen  bonding
different  from a covalent  bond
such as O—H?Hydrogen  Bonding  and Properties  of Water
Hydrogen  bonding  also explains  water’s  unusual  property  of being less
dense in the solid state than in the liquid state. As you know from kinetic
molecular  theory,  lower temperatures  cause liquid  molecules  to move
slower  than in their gaseous  states. When liquids  solidify,  the kinetic
energy  of the particles  is no longer enough  to prevent  the intermolecular
forces of attraction  from causing  particles  to stick together.  For most
substances,  their solid states are denser  than their liquid states. When
water freezes,  however,  the water molecules  pack in such a way that the
solid state is Jess dense than the liquid state. Water molecules  align in a
specific  pattern  so that hydrogen  atoms of one molecule  are oriented
toward  the oxygen  atom of another  molecule.  You can see this clearly  in
Figure 4.18. If water molecules  behaved  as most molecules  do, then lake
water would  freeze from the bottom  up, rather  than from the top down.
The consequences  for aquatic  life, and on organisms  (like us) that depend
on aquatic  ecosystems,  would  be profound.  A lake that freezes  from the
bottom  up would  solidify  completely,  killing  most of the life it contains.
Because  ice floats on water, it insulates  the water  beneath  it, preventing
it from freezing.
Hydrogen  bonding  also explains  the solubility  in water of polar
covalent  compounds.  As you learned  in Unit 1, the O—H  functional
group in alcohols  is polar. Because  of this polar group, alcohols  can form
hydrogen  bonds with water molecules.  Consequently,  methanol  and
ethanol  are soluble  in water in all proportions,  and every alcohol  is more
soluble  than its corresponding  alkane  with the same number  of carbon
atoms. (Recall  that alkanes  do not have the O—H  functional  group.)
Ammonia,  NHsz, is a very soluble  gas because  it hydrogen-bonds  with
water. The smaller  mass amines,  such as methylamine,  CH3;NHg,  are also
soluble  in water, for the same reason.
In its solid state, water has an open, hexagonal,  crystalline  structure.  As a
result of these spaces,  ice is less dense than liquid water.

Bonding  in Solids
In Investigation  4-A, you classified  solid substances  on the basis of the
types of bonds that hold their molecules  or ions together.  This is not,
however,  the only way to classify  solids. Chemists  also divide solids
into two categories  based on the macroscopic  properties  that arise
from the arrangements  of their component  particles.  Crystalline  solids
have organized  particle  arrangements,  so they have distinct  shapes.
Gemstones  such as amethyst  and garnet  are examples  of crystalline
solids. Amorphous  solids have indistinct  shapes,  because  their particle
arrangements  lack order. Glass and rubber  are common  amorphous  solids.
In the next few pages, you will learn about the structure  and properties
of crystalline  and amorphous  solids.
Bonding  and Properties  of Crystalline  Solids
Chemists  further  classify  crystalline  solids into five types, based on
their composition.  These types are atomic,  molecular,  network,  ionic,
and metallic.  Since you have already  learned  about metallic  solids,  the
material  that follows  concentrates  on the other four crystalline  solids.
You will find a summary  of their properties  in Table 4.5, following  these
descriptions.
196 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Atomic  Solids
Atomic  solids are made up of individual  atoms that are held together
solely  by dispersion  forces. The number  of naturally  occurring  atomic
solids is quite small. In fact, the noble gases in their solid state are the
only examples.  Since the only forces holding  atomic  solids together  are
dispersion  forces, these solids have very low melting  and boiling  points.
Molecular  Solids
Molecular  solids are, as their name implies,  made up of molecules.  Like
atomic  solids,  the molecules  that make up molecular  solids, such as
frozen  methane,  are held together  mainly  by dispersion  forces.
Consequently,  they tend to have low melting  and boiling  points.  In polar
molecular  solids,  however,  stronger  dipole-dipole  forces,  and sometimes
hydrogen  bonding,  give these compounds  higher  melting  points and
boiling  points  than non-polar  molecular  solids. For example,  the melting
point of non-polar  propane,  C3Hs, is -190°C.  A molecule  of polar formic
acid, HCOOH,  which  has a similar  number  of electrons  and the same
molar  mass as propane,  melts at 8.4°C. The large difference  in boiling
point is due to the hydrogen  bonding  and dipole-dipole  forces in formic
acid. You will often see molecular  solids classified  as covalent  solids.
However,  it is clearer  to classify  them as molecular  solids,  because
network  solids,  which  you will see below, also contain  covalent  bonds.
Network  Solids
Unlike  the intramolecular  covalent  bonds that hold atoms together  in
discrete  molecules,  it is possible  for atoms to bond covalently  into
continuous  two- or three-dimensional  arrays,  called network  solids.
A wide range of properties  can be found among  network  solids.
Carbon-Based  Network  Solids
Figure  4.19 shows four allotropic  forms of carbon.  Allotropes  are different
crystalline  or molecular  forms of the same element  that differ in physical
and chemical  properties.
Allotropic  forms of
carbon:  (A) graphite;  (B) diamond;
(C) Ceo, buckminsterfullerene;
(D) fullerene  nanotube

At temperatures  around 600°C
and extremely  low pressures,
methane  will decompose  and
deposit  a thin film of carbon,
in the form of diamond,  ona
surface.  The process,  known
as chemical  vapour  deposition,
or CVD, can be used to coat
a wide variety  of surfaces.  The
hardness  of this diamond  film
can be used for applications
that require  non-scratch
surfaces  such as cookware,
eyeglasses,  and razor blades.
/The graphite  shown  in Figure  4.19A is a soft, two-dimensional
network  solid that is a good conductor  of electricity.  It has a high
melting  point, which  suggests  strong  bonds,  but its softness  indicates  the
presence  of weak bonds as well. Each carbon  forms three strong covalent
bonds with three of its nearest  neighbours  in a trigonal  planar  pattern.
This structure  gives stability  to the layers. The fourth,  non-bonding
pair of electrons  is delocalized  and free to move within  the layers. This
gives graphite  the ability  to conduct  an electric  current.  There are no
intramolecular  forces between  the layers.  Dispersion  forces attract  one
layer to another,  enabling  layers to slide by one another.  Graphite  feels
slippery  as a result of this characteristic.  In fact, many industrial
processes  use graphite  as a lubricant.
In diamond,  each carbon  atom forms four strong  covalent  bonds  with
four other carbon  atoms. This three-dimensional  array makes  diamond  the
hardest  naturally  occurring  substance.  The valence  electrons  are in highly
localized  bonds between  carbon  atoms. Therefore,  diamond  does not
conduct  electricity.  The planes of atoms within  the diamond  reflect  light,
which  gives diamond  its brilliance  and sparkle.  The regular  arrangement
of the carbon  atoms in a crystalline  structure,  coupled  with the strength  of
the covalent  C—C bonds,  gives diamond  its extreme  hardness,  and makes
it inert to corrosive  chemicals.
Fullerenes  make up a group of spherical  allotropes  of carbon.
Figure 4.19C shows Cgo, which  is one type of fullerene  discovered  in
1985. It was given the name buckminsterfullerene  because  it resembles
the geodesic-domed  structure  designed  by architect  R. Buckminster  Fuller.
Also known  as “buckyballs,”  Cgo is just one of several  fullerenes  that have
been discovered.  Others  have been shown  to have the formula  C79, Cya,
and Cgz. Because  of their spherical  shape,  researchers  have speculated
that fullerenes  might make good lubricants.
Recently,  microscopic-level  research  has developed  very small carbon
networks  called nanotubes.  As you can see in Figure 4.19D,  nanotubes
are like a fullerene  network  that has been stretched  into a cylinder  shape.
Nanotubes  of Capg9 and higher  may have applications  in the manufacture
of high-strength  fibres. In the year 2000, researchers  built a nanotube  with
a diameter  of 4 x 10° m. Up to that time, this nanotube  was the smallest
structure  assembled.
Other Network  Solids
Many network  solids are compounds,  not elements.
Examples  include  silica, SiO,, and various  metal silicates.
If you were asked to draw a Lewis structure  representing
SiOz, you might draw a molecule  that looks like CO,.
However,  unlike  the bonding  that occurs  in COz, the silicon
atom in silica does not form a double  bond with an oxygen
atom. The likely reason  is that silicon’s  3p orbital  is too
large to overlap  effectively  with a 2p orbital  of the oxygen
atom. Instead,  each silicon  atom bonds  to four oxygen
atoms to give a tetrahedral  network  with shared  oxygen
atoms, as shown  in Figure 4.20. The network  is represented
by the formula  (SiOz),  indicating  that SiO, is the simplest
repeating  unit. Quartz  is a familiar  example  of a material
composed  of silica.A representation  of quartz,  (Si02),,

lonic Crystals
You know that an ionic crystal  is an array of ions, arranged  at regular
positions  in a crystal  lattice.  However,  a closer look at the structure  of
ionic crystals  shows  that they have different  and distinct  arrangements,
depending  on the ions involved—specifically,  their charge and the size.
You can compare  the effect of size on crystal packing  to fruits stacked
in a grocery  store. For example,  if you were trying to stack two kinds of
fruit to attain the most efficient  use of space, kiwi may fit in among  grape-
fruit more efficiently  than oranges  could fill the same space. Similarly,  in a
crystal,  pairs of ions of the same or similar  size are arranged  differently
compared  with ions of different  sizes.
A crystal  lattice is made up of identical  repeating  unit cells that give
the crystal  its characteristic  shape. Figure  4.21 shows  a three-dimensional
representation  of a simple  cubic arrangement  of unit cells.
In most ionic crystals,  the anion is larger  than the cation  and,
therefore,  the packing  of the anions  determines  the arrangement  of ions
in the crystal  lattice.  There are several  possible  arrangements  for ionic
crystals  in which  the anions  are larger than cations,  and cations  and
anions  are present  in equal molar amounts.  For example,  Figure 4.22
shows  two different  arrangements  found in the structures  of sodium
chloride,  NaCl, and cesium  chloride,  CsCl.

Canadians  } in Chemistry
Dr. R.J. Le Roy
You usually  study science  as discrete  fields
of inquiry:  chemistry,  physics,  and biology,  for
example.  Each of these fields has numerous
sub-fields,  such as geophysics  and biochemistry.
One of the scientists  at the forefront  of chemical
physics  is Canada’s  Dr. R.J. Leroy.
During  a fourth-year  undergraduate  research
project  at the University  of Toronto,  Dr. R.J. Leroy
pursued  an answer  to the following  question:  If you
use photodissociation  to separate  iodine molecules
into atoms,  what fraction  of the light is absorbed,
and how does that fraction  depend  on the colour
(frequency)  of the light and on the temperature  of
the molecules?  (Photodissociation  is a process  that
involves  the use of light to decompose  molecules.)
The light causes  a bonded  molecule  in its
ground  state to undergo  a transition  into an excited
state. In this new state, the atoms repel one another,
causing  the molecule  to break apart. The fraction
of light absorbed,  as measured  spectroscopically,
depends  on the population  of molecules  in the
initial state.
Chemists  can use the fraction  of light absorbed
by a sample  to monitor  the concentration  of specific
molecules  in a closed,  controlled  environment.
To do this, chemists  also need to know the value
for a key proportionality  constant  that is unique  to
each substance,  known as the molar  absorption
coefficient.  These coefficients  can be measured  at
room temperature,  but not at high temperatures.
“In principle,  we have known  the quantum
mechanics  to describe  these processes,”  Dr. Le Roy
explains,  “But to use that information,  we have to
understand  the forces atoms experience  as the
atoms come together  or fall apart.”
For his master’s  thesis at the University
of Toronto,  Dr. Le Roy developed  computer
200 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Propertiesprograms  to perform  the exact quantum  mechanical
calculation  of the absorption  coefficients  governing
photodissociation  processes.  Later, when doing
his doctoral  thesis at the University  of Wisconsin,
he and his thesis supervisor,  Dr. Richard  Bernstein,
developed  the Le Roy-Bernstein  theory.  This theory
describes  the patterns  of energies  and other
properties  for vibrational  levels of molecules  lying
very close to dissociation.
To determine  when to trust the equations  of the
Le Roy-Bernstein  theory,  Dr. Le Roy developed  what
he calls “a little rule of thumb,”  more generally
known as the Le Roy radius.  A calculation  for the
Le Roy radius,  Rip, is:
R> Rip = 2l< ra? 3127 4+ < rp? >]
where  A is the internuclear  distance  between  two
atoms  A and B.
The Le Roy radius is the minimum  distance  at
which the equation  describing  the vibrations  of
molecules  close to dissociation  is thought  to be
valid. The < ra? > and < rg* > values are the squares
of the radii of the atoms of the two elements  (or
of the two atoms of the same element)  in their
ground  states.
Is there a practical  outcome  to mathematical
chemistry?  Dr. Le Roy strongly  encourages
“curiosity-oriented  science,”  as opposed  to a
focus on short-term,  practical  results,  partly because
practical  results  do come when processes  are
fully understood.
For example,  the study of global warming  is
hindered,  in his view, because  the intermolecular
interactions  are not well known.  “To properly  model
the processes,  we have to understand  the exchange
of energy  during molecular  collisions.  If we know
them, we can predict  an immense  amount.”
Making  Connections
1. In what ways are chemistry  and physics  related
to each other? Design a graphic  organizer  to
outline  their similarities  and differences.
2. Research  and development  funding  often
encourages  chemists  and chemical  engineers
to focus on practical  applications.  How does this
differ from Dr. Le Roy’s perspective?  With which
perspective  do you agree more? Write an
editorial  outlining  your opinions.
Determining  the Type of Bonding  in Substances
The type of bonding  in a substance  depends  upon the kinds of atoms it
contains  and the forces of attraction  between  those atoms. If you know
the physical  properties  of a substance,  you can often predict  the type of
bonding  in the substance.  Table 4.5 summarizes  the types of forces of
attraction  and the physical  properties  of solids with different  types of
bonding  discussed  in this section.  In Investigation  4-B, you will design
an experiment  in which  you predict  the type of bonding  in various
substances,  then test your prediction.

lonic Liquids:  A Solution
to the Problem  of Solutions
Although  organic  solvents  are commonplace  in
industry,  they are highly  volatile  and dangerous
in the large quantities  that manufacturing
processes  require.  Disposing  of used solvents
is a major environmental  concern.
Until recently,  the idea of a recyclable,
non-volatile  solvent  seemed  like the stuff of
science  fiction.  But in the 1980s, researchers
in the United  States were trying to create a new
electrolyte  for batteries.  Instead,  they created  a
colourless,  odorless  liquid  that was composed
of nothing  but ions—an  ionic liquid.
An ionic liquid is a salt in liquid  form.
Ionic liquids  do not usually  find practical
applications,  since ionic compounds  have
such high boiling  points.  For example,  sodium
chloride  does not begin to melt until it reaches
a temperature  of about 800°C.
In an ionic liquid,  the cations  are much
larger than in typical  ionic substances.  As a
result,  the anions  and cations  cannot  be packed
together  in an orderly  way that balances  both
the sizes and distances  of the ions with the
charges  between  them. As a result,  they remain
in a loosely-packed,  liquid form. Because  the
charges  on the cations  have the capacity  to
bind more anions,  an ionic liquid  has a net
positive  charge.  Notice  the large cation  of the
ionic liquid molecule  shown  below. This is
what makes ionic liquids  suitable  solvents.
The net charge can attract  molecules  of other
compounds,  dissolving  them.

L CH; :
Many properties  of ionic liquids  make them
more desirable  solvents  than organic  solvents.
For example,  ionic liquids  require  a lot of
energy  to change  their state—they  remain
as liquids  even at temperatures  of 200°C.PFe-
Chapter  4 Structures  and Properties  of Substances  * MHR 203In addition,  ionic liquids  evaporate  sparingly.
Organic  solvents,  on the other hand, easily
release  fumes  that are harmful,  often toxic,
and that can eventually  oxidize  and create
carbon  dioxide,  a notorious  greenhouse  gas.
As solvents,  ionic liquids  can be uniquely
“tuned”  to a particular  purpose  by adjusting
the anion/cation  ratio. To decaffeinate  coffee,
for example,  you could create an ionic liquid
that would  just dissolve  caffeine  and nothing
else. Current  research  suggests  that ionic
liquids  can be recovered  from solution
and reused.
Yet, there are still many hurdles  that must
be overcome  before  these substances  can be
put to widespread  use. Because  ionic liquids
boil at high temperatures,  conventional
methods  of separating  reaction  products  from
solution  cannot  be used. Pharmaceutical
manufacturing  processes,  for instance,  often
involve  the process  of distillation.  The higher
temperatures  required  to distill using ionic
liquids  (as opposed  to organic  liquids)  would
decompose  many of the desired  pharmaceutical
compounds.
The discovery  of ionic liquids  is proving  a
fertile field for researchers.  Ionic solvents  are
revealing  new mechanisms  of reaction  and
enhancing  our understanding  of the molecular
world.  As well, their potential  applications  in
both industry  and the home have encouraged
several  companies,  world-wide,  to further
explore  and develop  these unusual  substances.
Making  Connections
1. Investigate  some of the industrial  processes
where solvents  are currently  used. Could
ionic liquids  be used in any of these
industries  instead?  Why or why not? Look
into some of the ideas that ionic liquid
researchers  have proposed  for dealing  with
the unique  challenges  posed  by different
industries.
GEILE  Structure  of
soda-lime  glass. Four oxygen
atoms surround  each silicon  atom
in randomly  arranged  tetrahedrons.
a
You may have heard that
glass actually  flows very
slowly  over time. This is, in
fact, a misconception,  possibly
caused by the fact that some
older windows  are thicker  at
the base. In the past, window
manufacturers  were not able
to make windows  of perfectly
uniform  thickness.  The
windows  were probably  set
on their broader  side for
stability—their  thickness  did
not change  over time due to
slowly  flowing  glass.Amorphous  Solids
Solids that are composed  of molecules  that are not arranged  in an orderly,
crystalline  structure  are called amorphous.  This term comes  from the
Greek  word amorphos,  meaning  “without  form.” Glass is a typical
example  of this type of solid. Heating  silica sand to its melting  point of
approximately  1700°C,  adding  limestone  (CaCO3)  and soda ash (Na2CO3),
and then allowing  the mixture  to cool, was the first method  of making
soda-lime  glass, dating  back 4000 years ago.
Today,  soda-lime  glass makes  up almost  90% of all glass manufac-
tured and finds its applications  in window  glass and bottle production.
It typically  contains  SiOz, NagO, CaO, MgO, and Al,03. Soda-lime  glass
is referred  to as an ionic glass, with an approximate  composition  given by
the formula  Na2O - CaO -(SiO2),.  Figure 4.23 shows  that each silicon  atom
is surrounded  by four oxygen  atoms in a tetrahedron.  These tetrahedra  are
randomly  arranged  among  a network  of Na* and Ca”* ions that fill in the
spaces  to balance  the negative  charge  on the tetrahedron  network.
Glass is an isotropic  material,  which  means  that its properties  are the
same in all directions.  This is a useful property,  since it means  that glass
expands  uniformly  as it is heated.
By changing  the proportion  of the components  or adding  other
components,  different  properties  can be given to the glass. For example,
adding  B2Os3 so that it makes up 13% by weight  of the glass results  in
borosilicate  glass, sold as PyrexTM.  Its low coefficient  of thermal  expansion
indicates  that it will expand  very little when heated.  PyrexTM  is, therefore,
an “ovenproof”  product.  PyrexTM  is often also used in laboratory  glassware
as it can be heated  numerous  times over a flame without  cracking.
Flint glass contains  lead(II)  oxide, PbO and is used in lenses because
of its low refractive  index, meaning  that light passing  through  does not
bend very much.
Some elements  also exist in amorphous  forms. For example,  charcoal
is an impure,  amorphous  form of carbon.  When sulfur is heated  to its
boiling  point and cooled  quickly,  an amorphous  form called  plastic  sulfur
forms. It has the formula  S.., and is often called “polymeric  sulfur.”
204 MHR- Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Metal alloys can be amorphous,  too. LiquidmetalTM  alloy is an
amorphous  alloy of zirconium  mixed  with nickel,  titanium,  copper,  and
beryllium.  It is used in the heads of some brands  of golf clubs. Traditional
metal club heads may have microscopic  gaps where planes of metallic
crystals  meet. These tiny gaps are a potential  source of weakness.  The
amorphous  alloy is non-crystalline,  so the metal structure  does not have
potential  breakage  sites.
A Material  Made to Order: Intermolecular  and Intramolecular
Forces  in Action
The gloves in the photograph  at the start of this chapter  are anything  but
ordinary.  The thin, lightweight  fabric can withstand  startling  impacts  and
piercing  forces,  including  small projectiles  such as bullets.  In fact, this
same fabric is used to make bulletproof  vests. The long strands  of fibre
used to make such protective  gear are interlaced  to form a dense “net”
that is capable  of absorbing  large amounts  of energy.  You have probably
heard the trade name for this astounding  fibre: KEVLAR®.  It was invented
by an American  research  chemist,  Stephanie  Kwolek,  in 1965.
The secret to stopping  a bullet with a fairly soft fabric is that it
behaves  in much the same way as the netting  on the goal frame used in
hockey.  When a hockey  puck strikes a net at 100 km/h, its kinetic  energy
is transferred  to the lengths  of twine of the goal net. This twine is an
interlaced  mesh that has strands  which  stretch  horizontally  and vertically
to disperse  the energy  of impact  over a wide area.
The sample  principle  applies  to KEVLAR®.  It belongs  to a class
of fibres called aramids,  which  are polymers  containing  aromatic
and amide groups.  The polymer  forms in the condensation  reaction
between  terephthalic  acid and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine,  as shown  in
Figure  4.24A. The strength  of the polymer  comes from the intramolecular
forces in the aromatic  group that limit bond rotation  in the straight  chains,
and the amide linkage  that leads to intermolecular  hydrogen  bonding
between  the straight  chains,  as shown  in Figure 4.24B.

Chapter  4 Structures  and Properties  of Substances  * MHR 205
In addition  to stopping  a bullet from penetrating  the armour,  a
bulletproof  vest must also protect  the body from the blunt force of impact.
A bulletproof  vest cannot  have as much “give” as a hockey  net (that is, it
should  not stretch  back as much as hockey  nets do upon impact).
Otherwise,  its wearer  would  still be injured,  even though  the bullet  might
not pierce the fabric. To accomplish  this, the properties  of KEVLAR®  are
enhanced  by twisting  the strands  to increase  their density  and thickness.
The strands  are then woven  very tightly.  A resin coating  is applied  and
sandwiched  between  two layers of plastic  film. Each layer acts as a net
and slows down the bullet  a little at a time until it has been stopped.
Deriving  Theory  from Application:  Superconductors
When she first synthesized  KEVLAR®,  Stephanie  Kwolek  did not know
that it would eventually  be used in bulletproof  vests or protective  gloves.
She did, however,  understand  the theories  behind  the properties  that
make it suitable  for such applications—the  theories  of intermolecular
and intramolecular  forces. This is not always  the case. Often scientists
discover  a material  that has useful or interesting  properties,  but are unable
to explain  them.
For example,  in 1911, Dutch  physicist  Heike Kamerlingh  Onnes
cooled  some mercury  to the boiling  point of liquid helium:  4 K. He
found that at this low temperature,  the mercury  developed  an astonishing
property.  The super-cooled  mercury  had zero resistance  when an electric
current  passed  through  it. In other words,  none of the energy  of the
electrical  current  was given off as wasted  heat. The mercury  had become
a superconductor—a  material  with no resistance  to electric  current.
Most conducting  materials,  even good conductors  such as copper,  give
off wasted  heat as electric  current  passes  though  them. In other words,
they have resistance.  By contrast,  superconductors  are “perfect”  electrical
conductors.
Scientists  are interested  in superconductors  because  they have a num-
ber of properties  that arise from their lack of resistance.  For example,  once
a current  is induced  in a circuit  made with a superconducting  material,
the current  continues  to flow through  the circuit  indefinitely,  without  ever
diminishing.  Also, superconductors  have the ability  to completely  repel
magnetic  field lines. This means  that a magnet  placed  over a supercon-
ductor  hovers  in mid-air,  as shown  in Figure  4.25.

206 MHR-* Unit 2 Structure  and Properties
Since Onnes’s  discovery,  chemists  have discovered  other metals  that
superconduct  at extremely  low temperatures.  A niobum  metal alloy was
found to exhibit  superconductivity  at 23 K, for example.  But scientists
wanted  to find materials  that exhibit  superconductivity  at much higher
temperatures,  because  refrigerants  like liquid helium  are very expensive.
In 1986, materials  containing  copper  oxide ions were discovered  to
be superconductors  at 30 K. This was an astounding  discovery,  because
these materials  are insulators  at room temperature  and higher.  Researchers
began experimenting  with this new class of superconductors,  tweaking
their composition,  and soon developed  a material  (T1,Baz,CazCu3O19)  that
superconducts  at 125 K. This is close to the boiling  point of nitrogen,  a
cheaper  refrigerant  than liquid helium.
It would  be ideal, of course,  to eliminate  the need for a refrigerant
altogether.  Finding  a material  that exhibits  superconductivity  at room
temperature  is one of the driving  forces of superconductivity  research,
and the search continues.  As of 2001, the highest  known  temperature
for a superconductor  is 138 K. Researchers  continue  to search  for new
classes  of materials  that superconduct.  In fact, in 2001, researchers  found
evidence  to suggest  that carbon  nanotubes  may superconduct,  even at
temperatures  surpassing  the boiling  point of water.
Current  and Future  Applications
The properties  of superconducting  materials  suggest  a wealth  of
applications.  Despite  the need to maintain  low temperatures,  they have
already  found uses in magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI), a medical  diag-
nostic tool. They have also been used to create powerful  electromagnets,
used in magnetically  levitated  (MAGLEV)  trains. Superconductors  in
the future could be used to make 100% efficient  electrical  wires,
allowing  power  plants to be built far from cities. A room-temperature
superconductor  could also mean ultra-fast,  low-power  electronics.
Many of the ideas necessary  to help describe  and explain
superconductivity  involve  topics you will encounter  in future chemistry
courses.  Even armed  with these ideas, however,  researchers  do not yet
have a complete,  accepted  theory  to explain  this intriguing  property.
Nevertheless,  the list of superconducting  materials  continues  to expand,
and engineers  continue  to find practical  applications  for them.
Section  Summary
Describing  and explaining  the chemical  and physical  changes  in the
world around  you requires  an understanding  of matter  at the atomic  level.
You have seen, for example,  that the concepts  of intramolecular  and
intermolecular  forces are both needed  to articulate  the bonding,  structure,
and properties  of substances  as familiar  as water and as exotic as
KEVLAR®.  Each year, chemical  engineers  invent  thousands  of new
materials  and substances.  Each has its own characteristic  structure  and
properties.  Each demonstrates  the amazing  diversity  of matter  that arises
from atoms,  molecules  and ions, and the forces among  and between  them.
In the next Unit, you will continue  to examine  chemical  bonds,  but
with a different  emphasis.  You will learn about the energy  changes  that
are associated  with breaking  and forming  bonds.  In other words,  you will
examine  the energy  changes  of chemical  reactions.

Materials  Convention
Background
The qualities  and characteristics  of a material  are
determined  by the bonding  between  the particles
that make up the material.  For example,  pure car-
bon exists in several  different  forms, or allotropes.
Each allotrope  contains  different  bonding,  and
therefore  has different  properties.  The “lead” of
a pencil is really made of graphite,  a silver-grey
allotrope  of carbon.  Graphite  is a good writing  tool
because  the layered  bonding  arrangement  creates  a
soft material  that is easily transferred  to paper by
rubbing.  The softness  and slipperiness  of graphite
also make it a valuable  industrial  lubricant.
Diamond,  another  allotrope  of carbon,  is one of the
hardest  materials  on Earth. Diamonds  are useful  in
cutting  and drilling  applications.  Because  they are
beautiful,  sparkling  stones,  diamonds  are also used
in jewellery.
Humans  have used the materials  in their
environment  for thousands  of years. In addition
to natural  materials,  new materials  are continually
being invented.  Some inventions  take place by
accident,  and others by design.  These new materials
are often more effective,  efficient,  or cheaper  than
traditional  materials.
Optical  fibres, each made of two different  types of glass,
pass through  the eye of a steel needle.
212 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure  and PropertiesWhale  oil was once a popular  choice  for lamp fuel.
Later, a new, “cutting-edge”  fuel was developed  from
petroleum  to replace  whale oil. What was this new
fuel? How did it compare  to whale oil?
Copper  has long been prized  for its beauty,
malleability,  and conductivity.  However,  in recent
fibre-optic  technology,  intricate  atom-layering
production  processes  are being used to produce  a
material  that has thousands  of times the conductive
ability  of copper.  What is this new material?

Look ahead to the project  at the
end of Unit 3. Start preparing  for
the project  now by listing what you
already  know about catalysts  and
enzymes.  Think about how catalysts
and enzymes  affect chemical
reactions.  As you work through  the

and present  a bulletin about the
uses of catalysts  and enzymes  in
Canadian  industries.I. the nineteenth  century, railway
tunnels  were blasted  through  the
Rocky  Mountains  to connect  British
Columbia  with the rest of Canada.
Workers  used nitroglycerin  to blast
through  the rock. This compound  is
so unstable,  however,  that accidents
were frequent  and many workers
died. Alfred  B. Nobel found a way
to stabilize  nitroglycerin,  and make
it safer to use, when he invented
dynamite.
What makes  nitroglycerin  such
a dangerous  substance?  First, nitro-
glycerin,  C;H5(NO3)3(¢),  gives off a
large amount  of energy  when it
decomposes.  In fact, about 1500 kJ
of energy  is released  for every mole
of nitroglycerin  that reacts. Second,
the decomposition  of nitroglycerin
occurs  very quickly—in  a fraction
of a second.  This fast, exothermic
reaction  is accompanied  by a
tremendous  shock  wave, which  is
caused  by the expansion  of the
gaseous  products.  Finally,
nitroglycerin  is highly  shock-
sensitive.  Simply  shaking  or jarring
it can cause it to react.
Thus, nitroglycerin’s  explosive
properties  are caused  by three fac-
tors: the energy  that is given off by
its decomposition,  the rate at which
the reaction  occurs,  and the small
amount  of energy  that is needed  to
initiate  the reaction.  In this unit,
you will learn about the energy  and
rates of various  chemical  reactions.Energy  Changes  and

Think about a prehistoric  family group building  a fire. It may seem as
though  this fire does not have much in common  with a nuclear  power
plant. Both the fire and the nuclear  power  plant, however,  are technolo-
gies that harness  energy-producing  processes.
As you learned  in Unit 2, humans  continually  devise  new techno-
logies that use chemical  reactions  to produce  materials  with useful
properties.  Since the invention  of fire, humans  have also worked  to devise
technologies  that harness  energy.  These technologies  depend  on the fact
that every chemical,  physical,  and nuclear  process  is accompanied  by a
characteristic  energy  change.  Consider  the melting  of an ice cube to cool a
drink, the combustion  of natural  gas to cook a meal, and the large-scale
production  of electricity  via a nuclear  power  plant. All societies  depend
on the energy  changes  that are associated  with these physical,  chemical,
and nuclear  processes.
In this chapter,  you will study the causes  and magnitude  of the
energy  changes  that accompany  physical  changes,  chemical  reactions,
and nuclear  reactions.  You will see that different  processes  involve  vastly
different  amounts  of energy.  You will learn how to calculate  the amount
of energy  that is absorbed  or released  by many simple  physical  changes
and chemical  reactions.  This will allow you to predict  energy  changes
without  having  to carry out the reaction—an  important  skill to have when
dealing  with dangerous  reactions.  Finally,  you will examine  the efficiency
and environmental  impact  of traditional  and alternative  energy  sources.

The Energy  of Physical,  Chemical,
and Nuclear  Processes
Most physical  changes,  chemical  reactions,  and nuclear  reactions  are
accompanied  by changes  in energy.  These energy  changes  are crucial  to
life on Earth. For example,  chemical  reactions  in your body generate  the
heat that helps to regulate  your body temperature.  Physical  changes,  such
as evaporation,  help to keep your body cool. On a much larger scale, there
would  be no life on Earth without  the energy  from the nuclear  reactions
that take place in the Sun.
The study of energy  and energy  transfer  is known  as thermodynamics.
Chemists  are interested  in the branch  of thermodynamics  known  as
thermochemistry:  the study of energy  involved  in chemical  reactions.
In order to discuss  energy  and its interconversions,  thermochemists  have
agreed  on a number  of terms and definitions.  You will learn about these
terms and definitions  over the next few pages. Then you will examine  the
energy  changes  that accompany  chemical  reactions,  physical  changes,  and
nuclear  reactions.
Studying  Energy  Changes
The law of conservation  of energy  states that the total energy  of the
universe  is constant.  In other words,  energy  can be neither  destroyed
nor created.  This idea can be expressed  by the following  equation:
AEuniverse  = 0
Energy  can, however,  be transferred  from one substance  to another.  It can
also be converted  into various  forms. In order to interpret  energy  changes,
scientists  must clearly  define what part of the universe  they are dealing
with. The system  is defined  as the part of the universe  that is being studied
and observed.  In a chemical  reaction,  the system  is usually  made up of the
reactants  and products.  By contrast,  the surroundings  are everything  else
in the universe.  The two equations  below show the relationship  between
the universe,  a system,  and the system’s  surroundings.
Universe  = System  + Surroundings
AEuniverse  = AEsystem  + AE surroundings  =0
From the relationship,  we know that any change  in the system  is
accompanied  by an equal and opposite  change  in the surroundings.
AEsystem  = —AF surroundings
Look at the chemical  reaction  that is taking  place in the flask in
Figure 5.1. A chemist  would  probably  define the system  as the contents
of the flask—the  reactants  and products.  Technically,  the rest of the
universe  is the surroundings.  In reality,  however,  the entire universe
changes  very little when the system  changes.  Therefore,  the surroundings
are considered  to be only the part of the universe  that is likely to be
affected  by the energy  changes  of the system.  In Figure 5.1, the flask, the
lab bench,  the air in the room, and the student  who is carrying  out the
reaction  all make up the surroundings.  The system  is more likely to
significantly  influence  its immediate  surroundings  than, say, a
mountaintop  in Japan (also, technically,  part of the surroundings).5.1

Heat and Temperature
Heat, Q, refers to the transfer  of kinetic  energy.  Heat is expressed  in the
same units as energy—joules  (J). Heat is transferred  spontaneously  from a
warmer  object to a cooler  object. When  you close the door of your home on
a cold day to “prevent  the cold from getting  in,” you are actually  preventing
the heat from escaping.  You are preventing  the kinetic  energy  in your warm
home from transferring  to colder  objects,  including  the cold air, outside.
Temperature,  T, is a measure  of the average  kinetic  energy  of the particles
that make up a substance  or system.  You can think of temperature  as a way
of quantifying  how hot or cold a substance  is, relative  to another  substance.
K >
| Figure 5.2 | Celsius degrees  and Kelvin degrees  are the same size. The Kelvin scale begins
at absolute  zero. This is the temperature  at which the particles  in a substance  have no kinetic
energy.  Therefore,  Kelvin temperatures  are never negative.  By contrast,  0°C is set at the
melting  point of water. Celsius  temperatures  can be positive  or negative.
Temperature  is measured  in either Celsius  degrees  (°C) or kelvins  (K).
The Celsius  scale is a relative  scale. It was designed  so that water’s
boiling  point is at 100°C and water’s  melting  point is at 0°C. The Kelvin
scale, on the other hand, is an absolute  scale. It was designed  so that 0 K
is the temperature  at which  a substance  possesses  no kinetic  energy.  The
relationship  between  the Kelvin  and Celsius  scales is shown  in Figure 5.2,
and by the following  equation.
Temperature  in Kelvin  degrees  = Temperature  in Celsius  degrees  + 273.15
Enthalpy  and Enthalpy  Change
Chemists  define the total internal  energy  of a substance  at a constant
pressure  as its enthalpy,  H. Chemists  do not work with the absolute
enthalpy  of the reactants  and products  in a physical  or chemical  process.
Instead,  they study the enthalpy  change,  AH, that accompanies  a process.
That is, they study the relative  enthalpy  of the reactants  and products  in a
system.  This is like saying  that the distance  between  your home and your
school is 2 km. You do not usually  talk about the absolute  position  of
your home and school  in terms of their latitude,  longitude,  and elevation.
You talk about their relative  position,  in relation  to each other.
The enthalpy  change  of a process  is equivalent  to its heat change  at
constant  pressure.
222 MHR- Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
Enthalpy  Changes  in Chemical  Reactions
In chemical  reactions,  enthalpy  changes  result from chemical  bonds  being
broken  and formed.  Chemical  bonds are sources  of stored energy.  Breaking
a bond is a process  that requires  energy.  Creating  a bond is a process  that
releases  energy.  For example,  consider  the combustion  reaction  that takes
place when nitrogen  reacts with oxygen.
Now) + O2(g) > 2NO¢)
In this reaction,  one mole of nitrogen-nitrogen  triple bonds and one mole
of oxygen-oxygen  double  bonds are broken.  Two moles of nitrogen-oxygen
bonds are formed.  This reaction  absorbs  energy.  In other words,  more
energy  is released  to form two nitrogen-oxygen  bonds than is used to break
one nitrogen-nitrogen  bond and one oxygen-oxygen  bond. When  a reaction
results  in a net absorption  of energy,  it is called an endothermic  reaction.
On the other hand, when  a reaction  results  in a net release  of energy,
it is called an exothermic  reaction.  In an exothermic  reaction,  more energy
is released  to form bonds than is used to break  bonds.  Therefore,  energy  is
released.  Figure 5.3 shows  the relationship  between  bond breaking,  bond
formation,  and endothermic  and exothermic  reactions.

Representing  Enthalpy  Changes
The enthalpy  change  of a chemical  reaction  is known  as the enthalpy
of reaction,  AH,,,. The enthalpy  of reaction  is dependent  on conditions
such as temperature  and pressure.  Therefore,  chemists  often talk about the
standard  enthalpy  of reaction,  AH’,,,:  the enthalpy  change  of a chemical
reaction  that occurs at SATP (25°C and 100 kPa). Often, AH’x, is written
simply  as AH’. The * symbol  is called “nought.”  It refers to a property  of
a substance  at a standard  state or under standard  conditions.  You may
see the enthalpy  of reaction  referred  to as the heat of reaction  in other
chemistry  books.
Representing  Exothermic  Reactions
There are three different  ways to represent  the enthalpy  change  of an
exothermic  reaction.  The simplest  way is to use a thermochemical
equation:  a balanced  chemical  equation  that indicates  the amount  of heat
that is absorbed  or released  by the reaction  it represents.  For example,
consider  the exothermic  reaction  of one mole of hydrogen  gas with half
a mole of oxygen  gas to produce  liquid water. For each mole of hydrogen
gas that reacts, 285.8 kJ of heat is produced.  Notice  that the heat term is
included  with the products  because  heat is produced.

Chemists  use different  sub-
scripts  to represent  enthalpy
changes  for specific  kinds
of reactions.  For example,
AHcomb  represents  the enthalpy
change  of a combustion
reaction.

beside  the chemical  equation.  For exothermic  reactions,  AH” is always
negative.
Haig) + 5 Or08) > H20) AH ixn = —285.8 kJ
A third way to represent  the enthalpy  of reaction  is to use an enthalpy
diagram.  Examine  Figure 5.4 to see how this is done.
Representing  Endothermic  Reactions
The endothermic  decomposition  of solid magnesium  carbonate  produces
solid magnesium  oxide and carbon  dioxide  gas. For each mole of magne-
sium carbonate  that decomposes,  117.3 kJ of energy  is absorbed.  As for an
exothermic  reaction,  there are three different  ways to represent  the
enthalpy  change  of an endothermic  reaction.
You can include  the enthalpy  of reaction  as a heat term in the
chemical  equation.  Because  heat is absorbed  in an endothermic  reaction,
the heat term is included  on the reactant  side of the equation.
117.3 kJ + MgCOs(s) > MgOj)  + CO2¢g)
You can also indicate  the enthalpy  of reaction  as a separate  expression
beside  the chemical  reaction.  For endothermic  reactions,  the enthalpy  of
reaction  is always  positive.
MgCOas) > MgO,s)  + CO2¢z) AH’xn = 117.3 kJ
Finally,  you can use a diagram  to show the enthalpy  of reaction.
Figure 5.5 shows  how the decomposition  of solid magnesium  carbonate
can be represented  graphically.
Stoichiometry  and Thermochemical  Equations
The thermochemical  equation  for the decomposition  of magnesium
carbonate,  shown  above, indicates  that 117.3 kJ of energy  is absorbed
when one mole, or 84.32 g, of magnesium  carbonate  decomposes.  The
decomposition  of two moles of magnesium  carbonate  absorbs  twice as
much energy,  or 234.6 kJ.
MgCO,(5)  > MgO,s) + CO2¢) ARxn = 117.3 kJ
2ZMgCO2(s)  > 2MgOy)  + 2CO2(g) AFxn = 234.6 kJ
Enthalpy  of reaction  is linearly  dependent  on the quantity  of products.
That is, if the amount  of products  formed  doubles,  the enthalpy  change
also doubles.  Figure 5.6 shows  the relationship  between  the stoichiometry
of a reaction  and its enthalpy  change.  Because  of this relationship,  an
exothermic  reaction  that is relatively  safe on a small scale may be
extremely  dangerous  on  a large scale. One of the jobs of a chemical
engineer  is to design  systems  that allow exothermic  reactions  to be carried
out safely on a large scale. For example,  the blast furnaces  used in steel
making  must withstand  temperatures  of up to 2000°C,  produced  by the
exothermic  combustion  reaction  of coal with oxygen.

Heat Changes  and Physical  Changes
Enthalpy  changes  are associated  with physical  changes  as well as with
chemical  reactions.  You have observed  examples  of these enthalpy
changes  in your daily life. Suppose  that you want to prepare  some pasta.
You put an uncovered  pot of water on a stove element.  The heat from the
element  causes the water to become  steadily  hotter, until it reaches  100°C
(the boiling  point of water at 100 kPa). At this temperature,  heat is still
being added to the water. The average  kinetic energy of the liquid water
molecules  does not increase,  however.  Instead,  the energy  is used to break
the intermolecular  bonds between  the water molecules  as they change
from liquid to vapour.  The temperature  of the liquid water remains  at
MHR « Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
100°C until all the water has been vaporized.  If you add heat to the
vapour,  the temperature  of the vapour  will increase  steadily.
When  you heat ice that is colder  than 0°C, a similar  process  occurs.
The temperature  of the ice increases  until it is 0°C (the melting  point of
water).  If you continue  to add heat, the ice remains  at 0°C but begins  to
melt, as the bonds  between  the water molecules  in the solid state begin
to break.
Figure 5.7 shows the relationship  between  temperature  and heat for
a solid substance  that melts and then vaporizes  as heat is added  to it.

You can represent  the enthalpy  change  that accompanies  a phase
change—from  liquid to solid, for example—just  like you represented  the
enthalpy  change  of a chemical  reaction.  You can include  a heat term in
the equation,  or you can use a separate  expression  of enthalpy  change.
For example, when one mole of water melts, it absorbs 6.02 kJ of energy. J
H2,O0(s) + 6.02 kJ = H2,0)
The process  of melting  is also
H20(s) > H20( AH = 6.02 kJ known as fusion. Therefore,
Normally,  however,  chemists  represent  enthalpy  changes  associated  with you will sometimes  see the
phase changes  using modified  AH symbols.  These symbols  are described enthalpy  of melting referred  to
below. as the enthalpy  of fusion.

Vaporization  and condensation  are opposite  processes.  Thus, the
enthalpy  changes  for these processes  have the same value but opposite
signs. For example,  6.02 kJ is needed  to vaporize  one mole of water.
Therefore,  6.02 kJ of energy  is released  when one mole of water freezes.
AFAvap = —AHcond
Similarly,  melting  and freezing  are opposite  processes.
AHimeit = —AA fre
Several  enthalpies  of melting  and vaporization  are shown  in Table 5.1.
Notice  that the same units (kJ/mol)  are used for the enthalpies  of melting,

Hot Packs and Cold Packs:
Using the Energy  of Physical  Changes
You just learned  about the enthalpy  changes  that are associated  with
phase changes.  Another  type of physical  change  that involves  a heat
transfer  is dissolution.  When  a solute dissolves  in a solvent,  the enthalpy
change  that occurs is called the enthalpy  of solution,  AHgoin.  Dissolution
can be either endothermic  or exothermic.
Manufacturers  take advantage  of endothermic  dissolution  to
produce  cold packs that athletes  can use to treat injuries.  One type of cold
pack contains  water and  a salt, such as ammonium  nitrate,  in separate
compartments.  When you crush the pack, the membrane  that divides  the
compartments  breaks,  and the salt dissolves.  This dissolution  process  is
endothermic.  It absorbs  heat for a short period  of time, so the cold pack
feels cold. Figure 5.8 shows how  a cold pack works.

water pack
A typical cold pack has two separate  chambers.  One chamber
contains  a salt. The other chamber  contains  water. Crushing
the pack allows  the salt to dissolve  in the water—an
endothermic  process.
This person's  shoulder  was injured.  Using a cold pack helps to reduce  the
inflammation  of the joint.
Some types of hot packs are constructed  in much the same way as the cold
packs described  above. They have two compartments.  One compartment
contains  a salt, such as calcium  chloride.  The other compartment  contains
water. In hot packs,  however,  the dissolution  process  is exothermic.  It
releases  heat to the surroundings.

Energy  and Nuclear  Reactions
The energy  that is released  by a physical  change,  such as the dissolution
of calcium  chloride,  can warm your hands. The energy  that is released  by
a chemical  reaction,  such as the formation  of water, can power  a rocket.
The energy  that is released  by a nuclear  reaction,  such as the nuclear
reactions  in the Sun, however,  can provide  enough  heat to fry an egg on
a sidewalk  that is 150 000 000 km away from the surface  of the Sun.
From previous  science  courses,  you will recall that nuclear  reactions
involve  changes  in the nuclei of atoms. Often nuclear  reactions  result in the
transformation  of one or more elements  into one or more different  elements.
Like physical  changes  and chemical  reactions,  nuclear  reactions  are
accompanied  by energy  changes.  Nuclear  reactions,  however,  produce  sig-
nificantly  more energy  than physical  and chemical  processes.  In nuclear
reactions,  a significant  amount  of the mass of the reactants  is actually
converted  into energy.
Ever since Albert  Einstein  devised  his famous  equation,  EF = mc’,
we have known  that mass and energy  are interconvertible.  In Einstein’s
equation,  FE is energy  in kg+ m7*/s? (J), mis the mass in kg, and c? is the
square of the speed of light.
c* = (3.0 x 10° m/s)?
= 9.0 x 10'° m’/s?
As you can see, c* is an enormous  number.  Therefore,  even a very tiny
amount  of matter  is equivalent  to a significant  amount  of energy.
For example,  compare  the mass of 1 mol of carbon-12  atoms with the
mass of the individual  nucleons  in 1 mol of carbon-12  atoms. The mass of
6 mol of hydrogen-1  atoms (one proton  and one electron  each) and 6 mol
of neutrons  is 12.098 940 g. The mass of 1 mol of carbon-12  atoms is
exactly  12 g. Note that the mass of the electrons  does not change  in a
nuclear  reaction.
12.098 940 g/mol
— 12.000  000 g/mol
0.098 940 g/mol
The difference  in mass is significant.  It would  show up on any reasonably
precise  balance.  Thus, the mass of the nucleus  of carbon-12  is significant-
ly less than the mass of its component  nucleons.  The difference  in mass
between  a nucleus  and its nucleons  is known  as the mass defect. What
causes  this mass defect?  It is caused  by the nuclear  binding  energy:  the
energy  associated  with the strong force that holds a nucleus  together.
Nucleus  + Nuclear  binding  energy  — Nucleons
You can use Einstein’s  equation  to calculate  the nuclear  binding
energy  for carbon-12.
AE = Amc?
= (9.89 x 10° kg/mol)(9.0  x 101° m?/s?)
= 8.9 x 10” J/mol
= 8.9 x 10° kJ/mol
Clearly,  the energy  associated  with the bonds that hold a nucleus  together
is much greater  than the energy  associated  with chemical  bonds,  which
are usually  only a few hundred  kJ/mol.
The higher  the binding  energy  of a nucleus,  the more stable the nucleus
is. Nuclei  with mass numbers  (A) that are close to 60 are the most stable.
Nuclear  reactions,  in which  nuclei  break apart or fuse, tend to form nuclei
that are more stable than the reactant  nuclei.  Figure 5.9 illustrates  the
relative  stability  of various  nuclei.Web LINK

tion processes.  For example,

Nuclear  Fission
A heavy nucleus  can split into lighter  nuclei  by undergoing  nuclear
fission.  Nuclear  power  plants use controlled  nuclear  fission  to provide
energy.  Uncontrolled  nuclear  fission  is responsible  for the massive
destructiveness  of an atomic  bomb.
The most familiar  fission  reactions  involve  the splitting  of uranium
atoms. In these reactions,  a uranium-235  atom is bombarded  with
neutrons.  The uranium  nucleus  then splits apart into various  product
nuclei.  Two examples  of fission  reactions  that involve  uranium-235  are
shown  in Figure 5.10.Electronic  Learning  Partner

230 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
Fission  reactions  produce  vast quantities  of energy.  For example,  when
one mole of uranium-235  splits, it releases  2.1 x 10'* J. By contrast,  when
one mole of coal burns, it releases  about 3.9 x 10° J. Thus, the combustion
of coal releases  about five million  times fewer joules of energy  per mole
than the fission  of uranium-235.
Nuclear  Fusion
Two smaller  nuclei can fuse to form a larger nucleus,  in what is called a
nuclear  fusion  reaction.  You and all other life on Earth would  not exist
without  nuclear  fusion  reactions.  These reactions  are the source  of theThe fission of one mole of
uranium-235  produces  more
energy  than the fusion of one
mole of deuterium  with one
mole of tritium.  What if you
compare  the energy  that is
produced  in terms of mass of
reactants?  Calculate  a ratio
to compare  the energy  that

One example  of a fusion  reaction  is the fusion  of deuterium
and tritium.
°H + 3H > $He+ inis produced  from fusion and
fission,  per gram of fuel. What
practical  consequences  arise
from your result?
The seemingly  simple  reaction  between  deuterium  and tritium  produces
1.7 x 10’? J of energy  for each mole of deuterium.  This is about 10 times
fewer joules of energy  than are produced  by the fission  of one mole of
uranium.  It is still, however,  500 000 times more energy  than is produced
by burning  one mole of coal.
Scientists  are searching  for a way to harness  the energy  from fusion
reactions.  Fusion  is a more desirable  way to produce  energy  than fission.
The main product  of fusion,  helium,  is relatively  harmless  compared  with
the radioactive  products  of fission.  Unfortunately,
fusion  is proving  more difficult  than fission  to harness.

of Reaction  by Experiment
Chemical  and physical  processes,  such as the ones you studied  in
section  5.1, are associated  with characteristic  enthalpy  changes.  How do
chemists  measure  these enthalpy  changes?
To measure  the enthalpy  of a chemical  or physical  process,  chemists
insulate  the system  from the surroundings.  They can then determine
the heat change  by measuring  the temperature  change  of the system.  What
is the relationship  between  the heat change  and the temperature  change?
As you learned  in previous  science  courses,  each substance  has a charac-
teristic  property  that dictates  how its temperature  will change  when heat
is lost or gained.
Specific  Heat Capacity
The amount  of energy  that is needed  to raise the temperature  of one
gram of a substance  1°C (or 1 K) is the specific  heat capacity,  c, of the
substance.  Specific  heat capacity  is usually  expressed  in units of J/ge °C.
The specific  heat capacities  of several  substances  are given in Table 5.2.
Figure 5.12 shows  that you can often predict  the relative  specific  heat
capacities  of familiar  substances.

You can use the specific  heat capacity  of a substance  to calculate  the
amount  of energy  that is needed  to heat a given mass a certain  number
of degrees.  You can also use the specific  heat capacity  to determine  the
amount  of heat that is released  when the temperature  of a given mass
decreases.  The specific  heat capacity  of liquid water, as shown  in
Table 5.2, is 4.184 J/g« °C. This relatively  large value indicates  that a
considerable  amount  of energy  is needed  to raise or lower the temperature
of water.
234 MHR- Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
All samples  of the same substance  have the same specific  heat
capacity.  In contrast,  heat capacity,  C, relates  the heat of a sample,  object,
or system  to its change  in temperature.  Heat capacity  is usually  expressed
in units of kJ/°C.
Consider  a bathtub  full of water and a teacup  full of water at room
temperature.  All the water has the same specific  heat capacity,  but the
two samples  have different  heat capacities.  It would  take a great deal more
heat to raise the temperature  of the water in the bathtub  by 10°C than it
would  take to raise the temperature  of the water in the teacup  by 10°C.
Therefore,  the water in the bathtub  has a higher  heat capacity.
Specific  Heat Capacity  and Heat Transfer
You can use the following  equation  to calculate  the heat change  of a sub-
stance,  based on the mass of the substance.  You can also use this equation
to calculate  the specific  heat capacity  of the substance  and the change  in
its temperature.

where Q = heat (J)
m = mass (g)
c = specific  heat capacity  (J/g « °C)
AT = T;(final  temperature)  — T; (initial  temperature)(°C  or K)
Water is often used in controlled  surroundings  to measure  the heat of a
reaction.  For example,  you can use the equation  above to determine  the
amount  of energy  that is needed  to heat 1.00 x 10? g of water from 20.0°C
to 45.0°C.
Q=meceAT
The mass of the water is 1.00 x 10? g. The specific  heat capacity  of water
is 4.184 J/g-°C.  The temperature  of the water increases  by 25.0°C.
“.Q = (1.00 x 107,2)(4.184  J/g °€)(25.0°€)
= 1.05 x 10*J
To raise the temperature  of 1.00 x 10? g of water by 25°C, 1.05 x 10* J of
heat is needed.
Try the following  problems  to practise  working  with specific  heat
capacity  and temperature  change.
5. A sample  of ethylene  glycol,  used in car radiators,  has a mass of

is 2.46 J/ge°C.

From previous  science  courses,  you will probably  remember  that a
calorimeter  is used to measure  enthalpy  changes  for chemical  and
physical  reactions.  A calorimeter  works by insulating  a system  from its
surroundings.  By measuring  the temperature  change  of the system,  you
can determine  the amount  of heat that is released  or absorbed  by the
reaction.  For example,  the heat that is released  by an exothermic
reaction  raises the temperature  of the system.
Qreaction  = —Qinsulated  system
In your previous  chemistry  course,  you learned  about  various  types
of calorimeters.  For instance,  you learned  about a bomb calorimeter,
which  allows  chemists  to determine  energy  changes  under  conditions
of constant  volume.
In section  5.1, however,  you learned  that an enthalpy  change  repre-
sents the heat change  between  products  and reactants  at a constant
pressure.  Therefore,  the calorimeter  you use to determine  an enthalpy
change  should  allow the reaction  to be carried  out at a constant  pressure.
In other words,  it should  be open to the atmosphere.
To determine  enthalpy  changes  in high school  laboratories,  a
coffee-cup  calorimeter  provides  fairly accurate  results.  A coffee-cup
calorimeter  is composed  of two nested  polystyrene  cups (“coffee  cups”).
They can be placed  in a 250 mL beaker  for added stability.  Since a
coffee-cup  calorimeter  is open to the atmosphere,  it is also called a
constant-pressure  calorimeter.
As with any calorimeter,  each part of the coffee-cup  calori-meter  has
an associated  heat capacity.  Because  these heat capacities  are very small,
however,  and because  a coffee-cup  calorimeter  is not as accurate  as other
calorimeters,  the heat capacity  of a coffee-cup  calorimeter  is usually
assumed  to be negligible.  It is assumed  to have a value of 0 J/°C.
Using a Calorimeter  to Determine  the Enthalpy  of a Reaction
A coffee-cup  calorimeter  is well-suited  to determining  the enthalpy
changes  of reactions  in dilute aqueous  solutions.  The water in the
calorimeter  absorbs  (or provides)  the energy  that is released  (or absorbed)
by a chemical  reaction.  When carrying  out an experiment  in a dilute
solution,  the solution  itself absorbs  or releases  the energy.  You can
calculate  the amount  of energy  that is absorbed  or released  by the
solution  using the equation  mentioned  earlier.
Q=meceAT
The mass, m, is the mass of the solution,  because  the solution  absorbs  the
heat. When  a dilute aqueous  solution  is used in a calorimeter,  you can
assume  that the solution  has the same density  and specific  heat capacity
as pure water. As you saw above,  you can also assume  that the heat
capacity  of the calorimeter  is negligible.  In other words,  you can assume
that all the heat that is released  or absorbed  by the reaction  is absorbed
or released  by the solution.
The following  Sample  Problem  illustrates  how calorimetry  can be
used to determine  AH of a chemical  reaction.

Step 3 Based on the value of Q in step 2, the heat change  for the
reaction  is —1.3 x 10° J.
Step 4 Calculate  the number  of moles of CuSQ, as follows.

Calculate  the number  of moles of NaOH.
nmol NaOH  = (0.600 mol/¥)(50.0  x 107°4)
= 0.300 mol
The reactants  are present  in stoichiometric  amounts.  (There  is no
limiting  reactant.)
AH of the reaction,  in kJ/mol  CuSQ,,  is
_ -1.3 x 10°J
AH = 0.0150 mol CuSO,
= -8.9 x 10° J/mol CuSO,
= —89 kJ/mol  CuSO,
The enthalpy  change  of the reaction  is —-89 kJ/mol  CuSQg.
Step5 The thermochemical  equation  is
CuSOataq)  + 2NaOH aq) — Cu(OH)as)  + NazSOataq) AH = -89 kJ
Check Your Solution
The solution  has the correct  number  of significant  digits. The units are
correct.  You know that the reaction  was exothermic,  because  the temper-
ature of the solution  increased.  The calculated  AH is negative,  which  is
correct  for an exothermic  reaction.

In Practice  Problems  9, 11, and 12, you used experimental  data to deter-
mine the enthalpy  of reaction  for neutralization  reactions.  Neutralization
reactions  are particularly  well suited  to analysis  involving  the use of a
coffee-cup  calorimeter  for a number  of reasons:
e When  using dilute solutions  of acids and bases, you can assume
their density  is close to the density  of water. Therefore,  you can easily
measure  the volume  of the solutions  and calculate  their mass.
e Neutralization  reactions  between  dilute strong acids and dilute strong
bases tend to cause temperature  changes  in the reaction  mixture  that are
large enough  to be measurable  using a standard  thermometer,  but small
enough  for safety.
e Neutralization  reactions  take place very quickly.  Therefore,  the peak
temperature  change  also occurs  very quickly.  There is little time for
heat transfer  between  the insulated  system  and the surroundings  to
take place.
In the following  investigation,  you will construct  a coffee-cup  calorimeter
and use it to determine  the enthalpy  of a neutralization  reaction.

For example,  carbon and oxygen  can form carbon dioxide  via two reactions,  standard  molar
enthalpy  of formation  (AH";)pathways.
1. Carbon  can react with oxygen  to form carbon  monoxide.  The carbon
monoxide  then reacts with oxygen  to produce  carbon  dioxide.  The two
equations  below  represent  this pathway.

2. Carbon  can also react with oxygen  to produce  carbon  dioxide  directly.
Cis) + Ox(g) > COxg) AH* = -393.5  kJ
In both cases, the net result is that one mole of carbon  reacts with one
mole of oxygen  to produce  one mole of carbon  dioxide.  (In the first
pathway,  all the carbon  monoxide  that is produced  reacts with oxygen  to
form carbon  dioxide.)  Notice  that the sum of the enthalpy  changes  for the

Hess’s law allows  you to determine  the energy  of a chemical  reaction
without  directly  measuring  it. In this section,  you will examine  two ways
in which  you can use Hess’s law to calculate  the enthalpy  change  of a
chemical  reaction:
1. by combining  chemical  equations  algebraically
2. by using the enthalpy  of a special  class of reactions  called
formation  reactions
Combining  Chemical  Equations  Algebraically
According  to Hess’s  law, the pathway  that is taken in a chemical  reaction
has no effect on the enthalpy  change  of the reaction.  How can you use
Hess’s law to calculate  the enthalpy  change  of a reaction?  One way is to
add equations  for reactions  with known  enthalpy  changes,  so that their
net result is the reaction  you are interested  in.
For example,  you can combine  thermochemical  equations  (1) and (2)
below to find the enthalpy  change  for the decomposition  of hydrogen
peroxide,  equation  (3).
(2) Hog) + LO > H.0,, AH’ = -286 kJ
(3) HyOo1 + HOw + Ox) AH" =?
Carefully  examine  equation  (3), the target equation.  Notice  that
H2O: is on the left (reactant)  side, while H2O and 502 are on the right
(product)  side. Now examine  equations  (1) and (2). Notice  which  sides of
the equations  HzO, and H,O are on. They are on the correct  sides, based
on equation  (3). Also notice that hydrogen  does not appear  in equation  (3).
Therefore,  it must cancel out when equations  (1) and (2) are added. Since
there is one mole of Hag) on the product  side of equation  (1) and one mole
of Hag) on the reactant  side of equation  (2), these two terms cancel.  Set up
equations  (1) and (2) as shown  on the next page. Add the products  and
the reactants.  Then cancel  any substances  that appear  on opposite  sides.

or
Equations  (1) and (2) add to give equation  (3). Therefore,  you know that
the enthalpy  change  for the decomposition  of hydrogen  peroxide  is the
sum of the enthalpy  changes  of equations  (1) and (2).

In the previous  example,  you did not need to manipulate  the two equa-
tions with known  enthalpy  changes.  They added  to the target equation  as
they were written.  In many cases, however,  you will need to manipulate
the equations  before  adding  them. There are two key ways in which  you
can manipulate  an equation:
1. Reverse  an equation  so that the products  become  reactants  and the
reactants  become  products.  When you reverse  an equation,  you need
to change  the sign of AH’*(multiply  by —1).
2. Multiply  each coefficient  in an equation  by the same integer  or
fraction.  When  you multiply  an equation,  you need to multiply  AH”
by the same number.
Examine  the following  Sample  Problem  to see how to manipulate
equations  so that they add to the target equation.  Try the problems  that
follow  to practise  finding  the enthalpy  change  by adding  equations.

What Is Given?
You know the chemical  equations  for reactions  (1) and (2), and their

Plan Your Strategy
Examine  equations  (1) and (2) to see how they compare  with
the target equation.  Decide  how you need to manipulate
equations  (1) and (2) so that they add to the target equation.
(Reverse  the equation,  multiply  the equation,  do both, or do
neither).  Remember  to adjust AH’ accordingly  for each equation.
Write the manipulated  equations  so that their equation  arrows
line up. Add the reactants  and products  on each side, and cancel
substances  that appear  on both sides.
Ensure  that you have obtained  the target equation.  Add AH” for
the combined  equations.
Act on Your Strategy
Equation  (1) has CO as a reactant  and CO, as a product,  as does
the target reaction.  The stoichiometric  coefficients  do not match
the coefficients  in the target equation,  however.  To achieve  the
same coefficients,  you must multiply  equation  (1) by 3.
Equation  (2) has the required  stoichiometric  coefficients,  but Fe
and Fe,Os3 are on the wrong sides of the equation.  You need to
reverse  equation  (2) and change  the sign of AH’.
Multiply  each equation  as required,  and add them.

or
Fe204(5)  + 3CO¢@) > 3CO 2) + 2Fe(s)
The desired  equation  is achieved.  Therefore,  you can calculate
the enthalpy  change  of the target reaction  by adding  the heats
of reaction  for the manipulated  equations.
AH?’ = 3(-283.0  kJ) + 824.2 kJ = -24.8 kJ

Because  the equations  added correctly  to the target equation,  you know
you manipulated  the equations  with known  enthalpy  changes  correctly.

Using Standard  Molar Enthalpies  of Formation
You have learned  how to add equations  with known  enthalpy  changes
to obtain  the enthalpy  change  for another  equation.  This method  can be
time-consuming  and difficult,  however,  because  you need to find reactions
with known  enthalpy  changes  that will add to give your target equation.
There is another  way to use Hess’s law to find the enthalpy  of an equation.
Formation  Reactions
In Investigation  5-B, you used the reaction  of oxygen  with hydrogen  to
form water. Reactions  like this one are known  as formation  reactions.  In a
formation  reaction,  a substance  is formed  from elements  in their standard
states. The enthalpy  change  of a formation  reaction  is called the standard
molar enthalpy  of formation,  AH’. The standard  molar  enthalpy  of forma-
tion is the quantity  of energy  that is absorbed  or released  when one mole of
a compound  is formed  directly  from its elements  in their standard  states.
Some standard  molar enthalpies  of formation  are listed in Table 5.3.
Notice  that the standard  enthalpies  of formation  of most compounds  are
negative.  Thus, most compounds  are more stable than the elements  they
are made from.

By definition,  the enthalpy  of formation  of an element  in its standard
state is zero. The standard  state of an element  is usually  its most
stable form under standard  conditions.  Recall, from section  5.1, that
standard  conditions  are 25°C and 100 kPa (close to room temperature
and pressure).  Therefore,  the standard  state of nitrogen  is Nag). The
standard  state of magnesium  is Mgj).
Some elements  exist in more than one form under standard  condi-
tions. For example,  carbon  can exist as either graphite  or diamond,  as
shown  in Figure 5.16. Graphite  is defined  as the standard  state of carbon.
Therefore,  the standard  enthalpy  of formation  of graphite  carbon  is 0
kJ/mol.  The standard  enthalpy  of formation  of diamond  is 1.9 kJ/mol.
Another  example  is oxygen,  Ozg). Oxygen  also exists in the form of ozone,
250 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
Oz(g), under standard  conditions.  The diatomic  molecule  is defined  as the
standard  state of oxygen,  however,  because  it is far more stable than
ozone. Therefore,  the standard  enthalpy  of formation  of oxygen  gas, Oz),
is 0 kJ/mol.  The standard  enthalpy  of formation  of ozone is 143 kJ/mol.

water directly  from its elements  under standard  conditions.

CONCEPT  CHECK
X“Using enthalpies  of formation
is like a shortcut  for adding
equations  to obtain AH’.” Do
you agree with this statement?
Explain  your answer.Calculating  Enthalpy  Changes
You can calculate  the enthalpy  change  of a chemical  reaction  by adding
the heats of formation  of the products  and subtracting  the heats of forma-
tion of the reactants.  The following  equation  can be used to determine  the
enthalpy  change  of a chemical  reaction.
AH® = X(nAH"*;  products)  — X(nAH"*;  reactants)
In this equation,  n represents  the molar coefficient  of each compound  in
the balanced  chemical  equation  and 2 means “the sum of.”
As usual, you need to begin with a balanced  chemical  equation.  If a
given reactant  or product  has a molar coefficient  that is not 1, you need to
multiply  its AH“; by the same molar coefficient.  This makes sense because
the units of AH”; are kJ/mol.  Consider,  for example,  the complete
combustion  of methane,  CHa).
CHa) + 202%) > COa(g) + 2H206)
Using the equation  for the enthalpy  change,  and the standard  enthalpies
of formation  in Appendix  E, you can calculate  the enthalpy  change  of this
reaction.
AH’ = |(AH’; of CO2,~)) + 2(AH’;  of H20@))]  — [1(AH’;  of CHa) + 2(AH’*;  of O2(g))]
Substitute  the standard  enthalpies  of formation  from Appendix  E to get
the following  calculation.
AH® = [(-393.5  kJ/mol)  + 2(—241.8  kJ/mol)]  — [(-74.8  kJ/mol)  + 2(0 kJ/mol)]
= -802.3  kJ/mol  of CH,
How does this method  of adding  heats of formation  relate to Hess’s law?
Consider  the equations  for the formation  of each compound  that is
involved  in the reaction  of methane  with oxygen.
(1) Hyg) + +O) + H20@) AH"; = -241.8 kj
(2) Cis) + O2(g) > COz¢g) AH’; = -393.5 kJ
(3) Cis) + 2H) > CHavg) AH’; = -74.6 kJ
There is no equation  for the formation  of oxygen,  because  oxygen  is an
element  in its standard  state.
By adding  the formation  equations,  you can obtain  the target equation.
Notice  that you need to reverse  equation  (3) and multiply  equation  (1) by 2.
2 X (1) 2 Ho(g) + Ox) > 2H20¢) AH’; = 2(-241.8)  kJ
(2) Cis) + Oa) > CO2gz) AH’; = -393.5  kJ
—1 x (3) CHa(g) — Co) + 2 Ho(g) AH’; = —1(-74.6)  kJ
CHa(g) + 20 21g) +&5) + 2Ff9(g) > 2H20 (9) + CO2(g) +£(5) + 241 2(0)
or
CHa(g) + 2026) > 2H20()  + CO2p)
Add the manipulated  AH’; values: AH® = 2(-241.8)  kJ — 393.5 kJ + 74.6 kJ.
= -802.3  kJ
This value of AH’ is the same as the value you obtained  using AH";
data. When you used the addition  method,  you performed  the same
operations  on the enthalpies  of formation  before adding  them. Therefore,
using enthalpies  of formation  to determine  the enthalpy  of a reaction  is
consistent  with Hess’s law. Figure 5.17 shows the general  process  for
determining  the enthalpy  of a reaction  from enthalpies  of formation.

The overall enthalpy  change  of any reaction  is the sum of the enthalpy  change
of the decomposition  of the reactants  to their elements  and the enthalpy  change  of the forma-
tion of the products  from their elements.
It is important  to realize that, in most reactions,  the reactants  do not
actually  break down into their elements  and then react to form products.
Since there is extensive  data about enthalpies  of formation,  however,
it is useful to calculate  the overall  enthalpy  change  this way. Moreover,
according  to Hess’s law, the enthalpy  change is the same, regardless  of
the pathway.  (In Chapter  6, you will learn more about the mechanisms
by which compounds  and elements  react to form different  elements  and
compounds.)  Examine  the following  Sample  Problem  to see how to use

Energy  and Efficiency
When  you think about energy  efficiency,  what comes to mind?  You may
think about taking  the stairs instead  of the elevator,  choosing  to drive a
small car instead  of a sport utility  vehicle,  or turning  off lights when you
are not using them. What, however,  does efficiency  really mean?  How do
you quantify  it?
There are several  ways to define efficiency.  One general  definition
says that energy  efficiency  is the ability  to produce  a desired  effect with
minimum  energy  expenditure.  For example,  suppose  that you want to
bake a potato.  You can use a microwave  oven or a conventional  oven.
Both options  achieve  the same effect (baking  the potato),  but the first
option  uses less energy.  According  to the general  definition  above,  using
the microwave  oven is more energy-efficient  than using the conventional
oven. The general  definition  is useful,  but it is not quantitative.
Another  definition  of efficiency  suggests  that it is the ratio of useful
energy  produced  to energy  used in its production,  expressed  as a percent.
This definition  quantitatively  compares  input and output  of energy.  When
you use it, however,  you need to be clear about what you mean by “energy
used.” Figure 5.19 shows factors  to consider  when calculating  efficiency
or analyzing  efficiency  data.

useful energy.  Often an efficiency  percent  only takes into account  the “energy  used” part of the ratio.
“ideal”  energy  output  of a system,  based on the energy  content  of the fuel.
Efficiency  and Natural  Gas
When discussing  the efficiency  of a fuel such as natural  gas, you need to
specify  how that fuel is being used. Consider,  for example,  natural  gas.
Natural  gas is primarily  methane.  Therefore,  you can estimate  an ideal
value for energy  production  using the enthalpy  of combustion  of methane.
CHa(g) + 202) > COxg) + 2H,0%) AH’ = -802 kJ
In other words, 16 g of methane  produces  802 kJ of heat (under  constant
pressure  conditions).
When  natural  gas is used directly  in cooking  devices,  its efficiency  can
be as high as 90%. Thus, for every 16 g of gas burned,  you get about 720 kJ
(0.90 x 802 kJ) of usable energy  as heat for cooking.  This is a much higher
fuel efficiency  than you can get with appliances  that use electrical  energy
produced  in a power  plant that runs on a fuel such as coal.
If natural  gas is used to produce  electricity  in a power  plant, however,
the efficiency  is much lower—around  37%. Why? The heat from the
burning  natural  gas is used to boil water. The kinetic  energy  of the result-
ing steam is transformed  to mechanical  energy  for turning  a turbine.
The turbine  generates  the electrical  energy.  Each of these steps has an
associated  efficiency  that is less than 100%. Thus, at each step, the overall
efficiency  of the fuel decreases.
Thinking  About  the Environment
Efficiency  is not the only criterion  for selecting  an energy  source.  Since
the 1970s, society  has become  increasingly  conscious  of the impact  of
energy  technologies  on the environment.
Suppose  that you want to analyze  the environmental  impact  of an
energy  source.  You can ask the following  questions:
e Are any waste products  or by-products  of the energy  production
process  harmful  to the environment?  For example,  any process  in which
a hydrocarbon  is burned  produces  carbon  dioxide.  Carbon  dioxide  is a
known  greenhouse  gas, which  contributes  to global  warming.  Any com-
bustion  process  provides  the heat required  to form oxides  of nitrogen
from nitrogen  gas. Nitrogen  oxides  contribute  to acid precipitation.
e Is obtaining  or harnessing  the fuel harmful  to the environment?  For
example,  oil wells and strip coal mines destroy  habitat.  Natural  gas GETTY  This gas pipeline
pipelines,  shown  in Figure 5.20, are visually  unappealing.  They also harms the ecosystem  by splitting
split up habitat,  which  harms the ecosystem. up habitat.
Chapter  5 Energy  and Change»  MHR 257
e Will using the energy  source permanently  remove  the fuel from the
environment?  A non-renewable  energy  source (such as coal, oil, or
natural  gas) is effectively  gone once we have used it up. Non-renewable
energy  sources  take millions  of years to form. We use them up at a
much faster rate than they can be replenished.  An energy  source  that
is clearly  renewable  is solar energy.  The Sun will continue  to radiate
energy  toward  Earth over its lifetime—many  millions  of years. A some-
what renewable  energy  source  is wood. Trees can be grown  to replace
those cut down. It takes trees a long time to grow, however,  and habitat
is often destroyed  in the meantime.
Comparing  Energy  Sources

Nuclear  Safety  Supervisor
Jennifer  Noronha
In some ways, nuclear  power  is an appealing  power
source.  Nuclear  reactions  create large amounts  of
energy  from minimal  material,  and they generate
none of the carbon  dioxide  and other emissions  that
cause acid rain and global warming.  The products
and reactants  of nuclear  reactions,  however,  are
dangerously  radioactive.  Therefore,  special meas-
ures are needed  to protect  nuclear  power  station
employees  from daily exposure  to radiation.  That
is where  Jennifer  Noronha  comes  in. Noronha  is
the supervisor  of Radiological  Services  at
Darlington.  Employee  safety—especially  from high
radiation  doses—is  her first priority.
The Darlington  Nuclear  Generating  Station
is located  70 km east of Toronto.  It uses a fuel of
natural  uranium  to produce  enough  electricity  to
provide  power  for a city the size of Toronto.
Noronha  and her radiation  protection  team plan and
implement  safety programs  that minimize  dose
rates, or the amount  of radiation  that station
employees  are exposed  to.
Station  employees  must undergo  four weeks
of radiation  protection  training.  This training  was
designed  by Noronha’s  department,  based on an
extensive  investigation  of radiation  fields within
the station,  as well as a thorough  evaluation  of
past safety programs  and approaches.  Through  this
training,  employees  learn how to measure  existing
dose rates with survey  equipment,  assess  whatkinds of tools and protective  clothing  are needed,
and take appropriate  action to lower radiation  doses.
For example:
e Airborne  hazards,  such as tritium  (present  in
radiated  water  vapour),  can be reduced  by running
the station’s  dryer system.  The dryer system
catches  the radiated  vapour  and dries it out of
the air.
e Non-airborne  radiation  can be countered  by
shielding  the affected  area with lead blankets  or
sheeting  material.
Noronha’s  strong mathematics  skills were evident
from an early age. When she moved  to Canada  from
Kenya at age 11, she was immediately  put ahead a
grade. Her mathematics  skills and her father’s  engi-
neering  profession  were what propelled  her toward
engineering.  Noronha  earned  her engineering
physics  degree  from McMaster  University.  Her
courses  included  general  chemistry,  biomedical
theory,  and nuclear  theory.  She worked  as a
commissioning  engineer  at Darlington  during its
start-up.  She tested  the station’s  safety  shut-down
systems  and helped  to bring the station’s  first
reactor  on-line.  “It was pretty amazing,”  Noronha
says. “At the time, it was still relatively  new
technology,  and it was Canadian  technology.”
Noronha  got her MBA from the University  of
Toronto  in 1998. Soon after, she moved  to her
current  position,  which allows  her to combine  her
people  skills and technical  expertise.

Hot Ice
When engineers  first began extending  natural
gas pipelines  through  regions  of bitter cold,
they noticed  that their lines plugged  with a
dangerous  slush of ice and gas. The intense
pressure  of the lines, combined  with the cold,
led to the formation  of methane  hydrates,
a kind of gas-permeated  ice. More than a
mere nuisance,  methane  hydrate  plugs were a
potential  threat to pipelines.  The build-up  of
gas pressure  behind  a methane  hydrate  plug
could lead to an explosion.  Now, however,
this same substance  may hold the key to a vast
fuel supply.
Methane  hydrates  form when methane
molecules  become  trapped  within  an ice lattice
as water freezes.  They can form in very cold
conditions  or under  high-pressure  conditions.
Both of these conditions  are met in deep
oceans  and in permafrost.  In Canada,  hydrates
have already  been found in large quantities  in
the Canadian  Arctic.  Methane  hydrate  has a
number  of remarkable  properties.  For example,
when brought  into an oxygen  atmosphere,  the
methane  fumes can be ignited,  making  it
appear  that the ice is burning!
Methane  releases  25% less carbon  dioxide  per
gram than coal, and it emits none of the oxides
of nitrogen  and sulfur  that contribute  to acid
precipitation.  Therefore,  using methane  in
place of other fossil fuels is very desirable.
Methane  hydrates  seem to be an ideal and
plentiful  “pre-packaged”  source of natural  gas.
Estimates  of the exact amount  of methane
stored in hydrates  suggest  there could be
260 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of ReactionSociety J) Envfrenment  }
enough  to serve our energy  needs anywhere
from 350 years to 3500 years, based on current
levels of energy  consumption.  This would  con-
stitute a significant  source of fossil fuels, if we
can find a way to extract  the gas safely and
economically.
Unfortunately,  hydrates  become  unstable
when the pressure  or temperature  changes.
Even small changes  in these conditions  can
cause hydrates  to degrade  rapidly.  Methane
hydrates  are stable at ocean depths  greater  than
300 m, but offshore  drilling  at these depths  has
been known  to disturb  the hydrate  formations,
causing  large, uncontrolled  releases  of flamma-
ble methane  gas. Also, methane  hydrates  often
hold sediment  layers together.  Therefore,  in
addition  to the danger  of a gas explosion,  there
is the danger  of the sea floor collapsing  where
drilling  occurs.
Methane  is a significant  greenhouse  gas.
A massive  release  of methane  could cause
catastrophic  global climate  change.  Some
researchers  believe  that the drastic  climate
change  that occurred  during  the Pleistocene
era was due to methane  hydrate  destabilization
and widespread  methane  release.
Nonetheless,  Canada,  Japan,  the United
States, and Russia  all have active research  and
exploration  programs  in this area. As global
oil supplies  dwindle,  using methane  hydrates
might  increasingly  be seen as worth  the risk
and cost.
Making  Connections
1. Compare  using methane  from natural  gas
with using methane  from methane  hydrates
in terms of environmental  impact  and effi-
ciency.  You will need to do some research
to find out extraction  methods  for each
source  of methane.
2. On the Internet,  research  one possible  struc-
ture of methane  hydrate.  Create a physical
model or a three-dimensional  computer
model  to represent  it. Use your model  to
explain  why methane  hydrates  are unstable
at temperatures  that are warmer  than 0°C.
Emerging  Energy  Sources
In the ThoughtLab  on page 258, you probably  noticed  that all energy
sources  have drawbacks  as well as benefits.  Scientists  and engineers  are
striving  to find and develop  new and better energy  sources.  One energy
source that engineers  are trying to harness  is nuclear  fusion.  As you
learned  in section  5.1, nuclear  fusion provides  a great deal of energy  from
readily  available  fuel (isotopes  of hydrogen).  In addition,  nuclear  fusion
produces  a more benign  waste product  than nuclear  fission (helium).
Unfortunately,  fusion  is not yet practical  and controllable  on a large scale
because  of the enormous  temperatures  involved.
Chemists  are also striving  to find new sources  for existing  fuels that
work well. The Chemistry  Bulletin  on the facing page discusses  a new
potential  source of methane.
Section  Summary
In this section,  you learned  about efficiency.  You learned  how it can
be defined  in different  ways for different  purposes.  You used your
understanding  of processes  that produce  energy  to investigate  the
efficiency  and environmental  impact  of different  energy  sources.
In Chapter  5, you learned  about the energy  that is associated  with
chemical  reactions.  You used a calorimeter  to measure  heat changes,  and
you used these heat changes  to write thermochemical  equations.  You
probably  already  realize  that adding  heat to reactants  often speeds  up a
reaction.  In other words,  raising  the temperature  of a system  consisting  of
a chemical  reaction  often increases  the speed of the reaction.  A familiar
example  is cooking.  You increase  the temperature  of a heating  element
to speed up the reactions  that are taking place in the food as it cooks.
How does increasing  temperature  speed up a reaction?  Is the enthalpy
of a reaction  related  to its speed?  Chapter  6 addresses  these questions.
Section  Review
@ @ Your friend tells you about an energy source that is supposed  to be
46% efficient.  What questions  do you need to ask your friend in order
to clarify  this claim?
© @ Efficiency  and environmental  concerns  are not always separate.  In
fact, they are often closely  linked.  Give three examples  of energy
sources  in which changes  in efficiency  affect environmental  impact,  or
vice versa.
© @ Design  an experiment  to determine  the efficiency  of a laboratory
burner.  You will first need to decide  how to define the efficiency,  and
you will also need to find out what fuel your burner  uses. Include  a
complete  procedure  and safety precautions.
0 Some high-efficiency  gas furnaces  can heat with an efficiency  of
up to 97%. These gas furnaces  work by allowing  the water vapour  pro-
duced during  combustion  to condense.  Condensation  is an exothermic
reaction  that releases  further  energy  for heating.  Use the information  in
this section  to demonstrate  the increased  heat output,  using Hess’s law.
The enthalpy  of condensation  of water is 44 kJ/mol.

© @ Hydrogen  is a very appealing  fuel, in part because  burning  it
produces  only non-polluting  water. One of the challenges  that
researchers  face in making  hydrogen  fuel a reality  is how to produce
hydrogen  economically.  Researchers  are investigating  methods  of
producing  hydrogen  indirectly.  The following  series of equations
represent  one such method.

R ecing cars, such as the one shown below, can reach speeds that are well
above 200 km/h. In contrast,  the maximum  speed of many farm tractors  is
only about 25 km/h. Just as some vehicles  travel more quickly  than others,
some chemical  reactions  occur more quickly  than others. For example,
compare  the two reactions  that occur in vehicles:  the decomposition  of
sodium  azide in an air bag and the rusting  of iron in steel.
When an automobile  collision  activates  an air bag, sodium  azide,
NaN3z(g),  decomposes  to form sodium,  Na), and nitrogen  gas, Nog). (The
gas inflates  the bag.) This chemical  reaction  occurs almost  instantan-
eously.  It inflates  the air bag quickly  enough  to cushion  a driver’s  impact
in a collision.
On the other hand, the reaction  of iron with oxygen  to form rust pro-
ceeds quite slowly. Most Canadians  know that the combination  of road salt
and wet snow somewhat  increases  the rate of the reaction.  Even so, it takes
several  years for a significant  amount  of rust to form on the body of a car.
This is a good thing for car owners—if  rusting  occurred  as fast as the
reaction  in an inflating  air bag, cars would flake to pieces in seconds.
Why do some reactions  occur slowly  while others seem to take place
instantaneously?  How do chemists  measure,  compare,  and express  the rates
at which chemical  reactions  occur? Can chemists  predict  and control  the
rate of a chemical  reaction?  These questions  will be answered  in Chapter  6.
The combustion  of gasoline  is a fast and highly exothermic
reaction.  Gasoline  is stored in a car's fuel tank, where it is
exposed  to oxygen in the air. Why does gasoline  in a fuel
tank not burst into flames  spontaneously?

As you learned  in the Unit 3 opener,  nitroglycerin  is an explosive
that was used to clear the way for railroads  across North America.  It
decomposes  instantly.  The reactions  that cause fruit to ripen, then rot,
take place over a period  of days. The reactions  that lead to human  ageing
take place over a lifetime.
How quickly  a chemical  reaction  occurs  is a crucial  factor in how
the reaction  affects  its surroundings.  Therefore,  knowing  the rate of a
chemical  reaction  is integral  to understanding  the reaction.
Expressing  Reaction  Rates
The change  in the amount  of reactants  or products  over time is called the
reaction  rate. How do chemists  express  reaction  rates? Consider  how the
rates of other processes  are expressed.  For example,  the Olympic  sprinter
in Figure 6.1 can run 100 m in about 10 s, resulting  in an average  running
rate of 100 m/10 s or about 10 m/s.
The running  rate of a sprinter  is calculated  by dividing  the distance
travelled  by the interval  of time the sprinter  takes to travel this distance.
In other words,  running  rate (speed)  is expressed  as a change  in distance
divided  by a change  in time. In general,  a change  in a quantity  with
respect  to time can be expressed  as follows.
Change  in quantity
Change  in time
_ Quantityfinal  — Quantityinitial
tinal — finitial
_ A Quantity
At
Chemists  express  reaction  rates in several  ways. For example,  a reaction
rate can be expressed  as a change  in the amount  of reactant  consumed  or
product  made per unit of time, as shown  below. (The letter A represents
a compound.)Rate
Amount  of Aga) - Amount  of Ajnitial (in mol)
tinal — finitial (in s)
_ A Amount  of A
- At
When  a reaction  occurs  between  gaseous  species  or in solution,  chemists
usually  express  the reaction  rate as a change  in the concentration  of the
reactant  or product  per unit time. Recall,  from your previous  chemistry
course,  that the concentration  of a compound  (in mol/L)  is symbolized  by
placing  square  brackets,  | ], around  the chemical  formula.  The equation
below  is the equation  you will work with most often in this section.Rate of reaction  =

Reaction  rates are always  positive,  by convention.  A rate that is expressed
as the change  in concentration  of a product  is the rate at which  the
concentration  of the product  is increasing.  The rate that is expressed
in terms of the change  in concentration  of a reactant  is the rate at which
the concentration  of the reactant  is decreasing.
Average  and Instantaneous  Rates of Reactions
If reactions  always  proceeded  at a constant  rate, it would  be straight-
forward  to find reaction  rates. You would  just need the initial and final
concentrations  and the time interval.  Reaction  rates, however,  are not
usually  constant.  They change  with time. How does this affect the way
that chemists  determine  reaction  rates?
Consider  the following  reaction.
Aig) > Cg) + De
Now examine  the graph in Figure 6.2. The blue line on the graph shows
the concentration  of product  C as the reaction  progresses,  based on the
data in Table 6.1.

The average  rate of a reaction  is the average  change  in the concentration
of a reactant  or product  per unit time over a given time interval.  For
example,  using the data in Table 6.1, you can determine  the average  rate
of the reaction  from t=0.0 stot=5.0s.

You can see this calculation  in Figure 6.2. On a concentration-time  graph,
the average  rate of a reaction  is represented  by the slope of a line that is
drawn  between  two points on the curve. This line is called a secant.
The average  rate of a reaction  gives an overall  idea of how quickly  the
reaction  is progressing.  It does not, however,  tell you how fast the reaction
is progressing  at a specific  time. For example,  suppose  that someone
asked you how fast the reaction  in Figure 6.2 was progressing  over 20.0 s.
You would  probably  calculate  the average  rate from t = 0.0 s to t = 20.0 s.
You would come up with the answer  3.12 x 10° mol/(Les).  (Try this
calculation  yourself.)  What would  you do, however,  if you were asked
how fast the reaction  was progressing  at exactly t= 10.0 s?
The instantaneous  rate of a reaction  is the rate of the reaction  at a
particular  time. To find the instantaneous  rate of a reaction  using a
concentration-time  graph, draw a tangent  line to the curve and find the
slope of the tangent.  A tangent  line is like a secant  line, but it touches  the
curve at only one point. It does not intersect  the curve.
268 MHR« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
[C] (mol/L x 103)The slope of the tangent  is the instantaneous  rate of the reaction.
Figure  6.2 shows  the tangent  line at tf = 10.0 s. As shown  on the graph,
the slope of the tangent  (therefore  the instantaneous  rate) at t= 10.0 s
is 2.3 x 10+ mol/(Les).
Notice  that near the beginning  of the reaction,  when the concentration
of the reactants  is relatively  high, the slope of the tangent  is greater
(steeper).  This indicates  a faster reaction  rate. As the reaction  proceeds,
the reactants  are used up and the slope of the tangent  decreases.

Reaction  Rates in Terms of Products  and Reactants
In the ThoughtLab,  you analyzed  the rate of the following  reaction  in
terms of the production  of oxygen.
2N205¢@)  > 4NO2@)  + O2(g)
There are two other ways to represent  the rate of this reaction:
e in terms of the rate of the disappearance  of dinitrogen  pentoxide
e in terms of the production  of nitrogen  dioxide
For every 1 mol of O2 that is produced,  4 mol of NOz are also produced.
This means  that the rate of production  of NO, is four times greater  than
the rate of production  of O2. Therefore,  the rate of production  of O2 is one
quarter  the rate of production  of NO,. You can express  the relationship
between  O, production  and NO, production  as follows.
AlO2] _ 1 AINOd!]
At 4 At
When 1 mol of O2 is produced,  2 mol of N20; are consumed.  Therefore,
the rate of production  of Oz is half the rate of disappearance  of N2O;. You
can represent  this relationship  as follows:

NO, is produced  at a rate of 5.0 x 10° mol/(L+s).  What is the
corresponding  rate of disappearance  of N2O; and rate of formation  of O2?
What Is Required?
Since N2O; is a reactant,  you need to calculate  its rate of disappearance.
O2 is a product,  so you need to find its rate of formation.
What Is Given?
You know the rate of formation  of NO» and the balanced  chemical
equation.
Plan Your Strategy
First check that the chemical  equation  is balanced.  Then use the molar
coefficients  in the balanced  equation  to determine  the relative  rates of
disappearance  and formation.
Since 4 mol of NO are produced  for every 2 mol of N2O; that
decompose,  the rate of disappearance  of N2Os is 2 or > the rate of
formation  of NOz. Similarly,  1 mol of Oz is formed  for every 4 mol
of NO,. Therefore,  the rate of production  of Oz is z the rate of NO»
production.
Act on Your Strategy
Rate of disappearance  of N,O; = ; x 5.0 x 10-6 mol/(Les)
= 2.5 x 10° mol/(Les)
Rate of production  of O, = _ x 5.0 x 10°§ mol/(Les)

Check  Your Solution
From the coefficients  in the balanced  chemical  equation,  you can see that
the rate of decomposition  of N.O; is +, or > the rate of formation  of
NO32. The rate of production  of Oz is ~ the rate of decomposition  of N2O;.

Methods  for Measuring  Reaction  Rates
How do chemists  collect  the data they need to determine  a reaction  rate?
To determine  empirically  the rate of a chemical  reaction,  chemists  must
monitor  the concentration  or amount  of at least one reactant  or product.
There are a variety  of techniques  available.  The choice of technique
depends  on the reaction  under study and the equipment  available.
Monitoring  Mass, pH, and Conductivity
Consider  the reaction  of magnesium  with hydrochloric  acid.
Mgjs) + 2HCliag)  > MgClo(aq)  + Hag)
Hydrogen  gas is released  in the reaction.  You can track the decrease  in
mass, due to the escaping  hydrogen,  by carrying  out the reaction  in an
open vessel on an electric  balance.  The decrease  in mass can be plotted
against  time. Some electronic  balances  can be connected  to a computer,
with the appropriate  software,  to record  mass and time data automatically
as the reaction  proceeds.
Another  technique  for monitoring  the reaction  above involves  pH.
Since HC] is consumed  in the reaction,  you can record  changes  in pH
with respect  to time. Figure 6.3 shows a probe being used to monitor  the
changing  pH of a solution.
272 MHR-* Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
A third technique  involves  electrical  conductivity.  Dissolved  ions in SS ~PROBEWARE
aqueous  solution  conduct  electricity.  The electrical  conductivity  of the
solution  is proportional  to the concentration  of ions. Therefore,  reactions If you have access  to
that occur in aqueous  solution,  and involve  a change in the quantity  of probeware,  do Probeware
dissolved  ions, undergo  a change in electrical  conductivity.  In the reaction Investigation  6-A, or a similar
above, hydrochloric  acid is a mix of equal molar amounts  of two ions: investigation  from a probeware
hydronium,  H;0*, and chloride,  Cl". The MgCl, that is produced  exists as rompany:
three separate  ions in solution:  one Mg** ion and two CI ions. Since there
is an increase  in the concentration  of ions as the reaction  proceeds,  the
conductivity  of the solution  also increases  with time.
Monitoring  Pressure
When  a reaction  involves  gases, the pressure  of the system  often changes
as the reaction  progresses.  Chemists  can monitor  this pressure  change.  For
example,  consider  the decomposition  of dinitrogen  pentoxide,  shown  in
the following  chemical  reaction.
2N205(g) > 4NO2ig)  + Ong)
When 2 mol of N20; gas decompose,  they form 5 mol of gaseous  products.
Therefore,  the pressure  of the system  increases  as the reaction  proceeds,
provided  that the reaction  is carried  out in a closed container.  Chemists
use a pressure  sensor  to monitor  pressure  changes.
Monitoring  Colour
Colour  change  can also be used to monitor  the progress  of a reaction.
The absorption  of light by a chemical  compound  is directly  related  to the
concentration  of the compound.  For example,  suppose  you add several
drops of blue food colouring  to a litre of water. If you add a few millilitres
of bleach  to the solution,  the intensity  of the colour  of the food dye
diminishes  as it reacts. You can then monitor  the colour  change.  (Do not
try this experiment  without  your teacher’s  supervision.)
For accurate  measurements  of the colour  intensity  of a solution,
chemists  use a device called a spectrophotometer.  (See Figure 6.4.)
This photograph
shows  a simple  spectrophotometer,
which measures  the amount  of
visible  light that is absorbed  by
a coloured  solution.  More sophisti-
cated devices  can measure  the
absorption  of ultraviolet  and
infrared  radiation.
Monitoring  Volume
When  a reaction  generates  gas, chemists  can monitor  the volume  of gas
produced.  In Investigation  6-A, you will determine  average  reaction  rates
by recording  the time taken to produce  a fixed volume  of gas. You will
perform  several  trials of the same reaction  to investigate  the effects  that
temperature,  concentration  of reactants,  and surface  area of reactants
have on the reaction  rate. You will also perform  one trial using a
different  reactant.

Factors  That Affect  Reaction  Rate
Chemists  have made the following  observations  about factors  that affect
reaction  rate. You may already  be familiar  with some of these observa-
tions, from your previous  studies  of chemical  reactions  and from
Investigation  6-A.
Summary  of Some Factors  That Affect  Reaction  Rate
1. The rate of a reaction  can be increased  by increasing  the
temperature.
2. Increasing  the concentrations  of the reactants  usually  increases
the rate of the reaction.
3. A catalyst  is a substance  that increases  the rate of a reaction.
The catalyst  is regenerated  at the end of the reaction  and can be
re-used.  You will learn more about catalysts  in section  6.4.
4. Increasing  the available  surface  area of a reactant  increases  the rate
of a reaction.
5. The rate of a chemical  reaction  depends  on what the reactants  are.
Chemists  and engineers  use these and other factors  to manipulate  the
rate of a particular  reaction  to suit their needs. For example,  consider  the
synthesis  of ammonia,  NHs, from nitrogen  and hydrogen.
Now) + 3H) > 2NH3(g)
This reaction  must be carried  out with high concentrations  of reactants,  at
a temperature  of 400°C to 500°C, in the presence  of a catalyst.  Otherwise,
the rate of production  of ammonia  is too slow to be economically  feasible.

Finally,  you carried  out an investigation  to review  some of the factors  that
affect reaction  rate. In the next section,  you will learn how to use a rate

Concentration  and Rate
The rate of a chemical  reaction  depends  on several  factors,  as you learned
in section  6.1. One of the factors  that affect reaction  rate is the concentra-
tions of the reactants.  You know that the rates of most chemical  reactions
increase  when the concentrations  of the reactants  increase.  Is there a more
specific  relationship?  In this section,  you will explore  the quantitative
relationships  between  the rate of a reaction  and the concentrations  of the
reactants.
Relating  Reactant  Concentrations  and Rate
Consider  the general  reaction  below.
aA + bB + products
This reaction  occurs at a constant  temperature.  The reactant  formulas  are
represented  by A and B. The stoichiometric  coefficients  are represented  by
a and b. In this section,  you will study reaction  rates that are not affected
by the concentrations  of the products.  Therefore,  you do not need to use
symbols  for the products.
In general,  the rate of a reaction  increases  when the concentrations  of
the reactants  increase.  The dependence  of the rate of a reaction  on the
concentrations  of the reactants  is given by the following  relationship.
Rate « [A]"[B]”
This relationship  can be expressed  in a general  equation  called the
rate law equation.  The rate law equation  is shown  in Figure 6.5. For any
reaction,  the rate law equation  expresses  the relationship  between  the
concentrations  of the reactants  and the rate of the reaction.  The letter k
represents  a proportionality  constant  called  the rate constant.  There is
a different  rate constant  for each reaction  at any given temperature.
The exponents  m and n must be determined  by experiment.  They
do not necessarily  correspond  to the stoichiometric  coefficients  of their
reactants.  They are usually  1 or 2, but values of 0, 3, and even fractions
can occur.

278 MHR-* Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
The values of the exponents  in the rate law equation  establish  the
order of the reaction.  If a given reactant  is found to have an exponent  of 1,
the reaction  is said to be first order in this reactant.  Similarly,  if the
exponent  of a reactant  is 2, the reaction  is second  order in this reactant.
The sum of the exponents  (m + n) is known  as the overall  reaction  order.
For example,  the rate law equation  below represents  a reaction  that is first
order in A, second  order in B, and third order (1 + 2) overall.
Rate = k[A]"|[B]?
Chemists  carry out experiments  to determine  the rate law equation  for a
given reaction  at a given temperature.  Later in the section,  you will work
with data and do this yourself.  First, however,  it is necessary  to examine
further  the rate constant  and reaction  order.
The Rate Constant
The magnitude  of the rate constant,  k, indicates  the speed of a reaction.
A small rate constant  indicates  a slow reaction.  A large rate constant
indicates  a fast reaction.  For example,  a first-order  reaction  with  a rate
constant  of 10? s will be essentially  complete  in less than 0.10 s. By
contrast,  a first-order  reaction  with a rate constant  of 10° s! will take
about 2 h.
As a reaction  proceeds,  the reaction  rate decreases  because  the
concentrations  of the reactants  decrease.  The value of the rate constant,
however,  remains  the same throughout  the reaction.  In other words,  for a
given reaction  under constant  conditions,  the value of k remains  constant.
What happens  if the temperature  changes?  Since the rate of a
chemical  reaction  depends  on temperature,  so does k. Because  a chemical
reaction  depends  on temperature,  chemists  who study reaction  rates
must work at constant  temperature.  Furthermore,  the value of k must
be accompanied  by the temperature  at which  the reaction  occurred.
For example,  for the second  order decomposition  of hydrogen  iodide,
k = 2.7 x 10° L/(mol-s)  at 440°C. When the temperature  is increased
to 500°C, k = 3.9 x 10°? L/(mols).
Defining  First-Order  Reactions
A first-order  reaction  has an overall  order of 1. The decomposition  of
dinitrogen  pentoxide,  N.O;, is an example  of a first-order  reaction.
2N205(g)  > 4NOzq)  + 50219)
Experiments  have shown  that this reaction  is first order in N2Os. In other CONCEPT  CHECK
words,  the rate law equation  is written  as follows: |
Chemists  can trace the

Because  the overall order of the reaction  is one, it is a first-order  reaction. reaction  shown on the left
Reactions  with more than one reactant  can also be first-order by monitoring  its conductivity.
reactions.  For example,  consider  the following  reaction. Explain why.\ /
(CH3)3CBriaq)  + HO ce) > (CH3)30H  (aq) + Fi" (aq) + BY (aq)
Experiments  have shown  that the reaction  is first order in (CH3);CBr,  and
zero order in water. In other words,  the rate of the reaction  does not
depend,  at all, on the concentration  of water. The rate law equation  is
written  as follows:
Rate = k[(CH3)3CBry|"[H20|°
The overall  reaction  order is 1 (1 + 0). The reaction  is first order.

For the decomposition  reaction

The values of the exponents
ina rate law equation  must
be determined  by experiment.

for more information  about
aspects  of material  covered
in this section  of the chapter.You frequently  encounter  first-order  relationships  in everyday
life. For example,  if one soft drink costs $1.50, two soft drinks cost
$3.00, three cost $4.50, and so on. This first-order  relationship  can be
represented  by the following  equation.
Cost = $1.50 (Number  of soft drinks)!
Defining  Second-Order  Reactions
A second-order  reaction  has an overall  reaction  order of 2. An example
of a second-order  reaction  is the decomposition  of hydrogen  iodide.
2HIg) > Hag) + lave)
Chemists  have determined,  by experiment,  that this reaction  is second
order in hydrogen  iodide.  Therefore,  the rate law equation  is written
as follows:
Rate = k[HI]?
Another  example  of a second-order  reaction  is the reaction  between  nitric
oxide and ozone.
NO) + O3(g) => NO 2) + Ora)
By experiment,  chemists  have determined  that the reaction  is first order in
nitric oxide and first order in ozone, as shown  below:
Rate = k[NO]'[O3]?
The overall  order of the reaction  is 2 (1 + 1). Therefore,  the reaction  is a
second  order reaction.
For a non-chemistry  example  of a second-order  relationship,  consider
the equation  for the simple  parabola,  y = x*. When x = 3, y = 9.
When x = 12, the value of y increases  to 12? = 144. In other words,
when the value of x increases  by 4, the value of y increases  by a factor
of 47 (16 x 9 = 144).
Other Reactions
There are also other types of reactions,  besides  first-order  and second-
order reactions.  For example,  consider  the decomposition  of ammonia  on
a tungsten,  W, catalyst.
Wo2NH3(g) —"> Noi + 3Ho(g)
The rate law equation  for this reaction  has been found experimentally.
Rate = k[NH3]°  = k
The rate of decomposition  of ammonia  on a tungsten  catalyst  is
independent  of the concentration  of ammonia,  since [NH3]° = 1.
In other words,  the rate of the reaction  is a constant.
Many reactions  have overall  orders  that are higher  than 2. Some
reactions  have overall  orders that are fractions.  In this text, however,
you will concentrate  on first-order  and second-order  reactions.
The Initial Rates Method
As you have learned,  the values of the exponents  in a rate law equation
must be determined  experimentally.  Chemists  determine  the values of
m and n by carrying  out a series of experiments.  Each experiment  has a
different,  known  set of initial concentrations.  All other factors,  such as
temperature,  remain  constant.  Chemists  measure  and compare  the initial
rate of each reaction.  Thus, this method  is called the initial  rates method.
280 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
There are several  reasons  for using initial rates. One reason  is that
chemists  do not need to follow  each reaction  to its end. This saves time,
especially  when studying  slow reactions.
Rate Experiments
To see how the initial rates method  works, consider  the following  reaction:
2N205(g) > 2NOxQ)  + Or)
The general  rate law equation  for this reaction  is given below.
Rate = k[N205]”"
To determine  the value of m, a chemist  performs  three experiments.  A
different  initial concentration  of dinitrogen  pentoxide,  [N2Oslo,  is used for
each experiment.  The subscript  0 represents  t = 0. Table 6.2 shows the
results  of these experiments.
Table 6.2 Data for Rate Experiments
Experiment Initial [N205]o  (mol/L) Initial rate (mol/(L - s))
1 0.010 4.8 x 10°
2 0.020 9.6 x 10°°
3 0.030 1.5 x 10°
The value of m can be determined  using at least two different  methods.  By
inspection,  you can see that when the concentration  of N2O; is doubled
(experiments  1 and 2), the rate also doubles.  When the concentration  of
NO; is tripled  (experiments  1 and 3), the rate also triples.  This indicates
a first-order  relationship,  as follows:
Rate = k[N2Os]'
Alternatively,  you can compare  the rate law equation  for each experiment
using ratios. This method  is useful when the relationship  between
concentration  and rate is not immediately  obvious  from the data.
Write the rate expressions  for experiments  1 and 2 as follows:
Rate, = k(0.010)”
=4.8x10°  mol/(Les)
Rate, = k(0.020)”
= 9.6 x 10° mol/(L-s)
Create a ratio to compare  the two rates.
Rate; _ k(0.010  mol/L)” _ 4.8 x 10° mol/(Les)
Rate, k(0.020  mol/L)” 9.6 x 10° mol/(L«s)
Since k is a constant  for reactions  that occur at a constant  temperature,
you can cancel out k.

rate constant  are determined
by your calculation.  For a
first-order  reaction,  the units
are always s-'. Show why this
is the case. What are the units

Once you know the rate law equation  for a reaction,  you can calculate  the
rate constant  using the results  from any of the experiments.  The rate law
equation  for the previous  rate experiments  is written  as follows:
Rate = k[N2Os]
You can use data from any of the three experiments  to calculate  k.
Substituting  data from experiment  1, you can solve for k.

give the same value of k.

Act on Your Strategy
Step1 Begin with experiments  1 and 2, where [ClO] is constant,  to
determine  the order of the reaction  with respect  to OH’.
Set up a ratio for the two rates as shown.  Notice  that you can
cancel out [C102] because  you chose experiments  in which [ClO2]
did not change.
Rate, _ k(0.0150  mol/L)”  (0.0150  mol/L)” _ 2.60 x 10 mol/(L+s)
Rate, k(0.0500  mol/L)”(0.0250  mol/L)? ~—- 1.30 x 10°° mol/(L«s)

n= 1 (by inspection)
Therefore,  the reaction  is first order with respect  to OH’.
Set up a ratio for experiments  1 and 3, in which [OH| is
constant  and [ClO] changes.  You can cancel  out the [OH|
terms right away.
Rate, _ k(0.0450  mol/L)”(0.0250  mol/L)” _ 1.16 x 10% mol/(L+s)
Rate, (0.0150  mol/L)”(0.0250  mol/L)? ~—- 1.30 x 107° mol/(L«s)
Since k is a constant,  you can cancel  it out.

m = 2 (by inspection)
The reaction  is second  order with respect  to ClO2.
Therefore,  the rate law equation  is written  as follows:
Rate = k[ClO2]?  [OH|
The reaction  is second  order in ClOsz, first order in OH’, and third
order overall.
Step 2 To find the value of the rate constant,  substitute  data from any of
the three experiments  into the rate law equation.  Using the data
from experiment  1 gives the following  equation.
1.30 x 10°mol/(L«s)  = k(0.0150  mol/L)?(0.0250  mol/L)
Solve for k.
ke 1.30 x 10° mol/(L«s)
(0.0150  mol/L)?  (0.0250  mol/L)
= 231 L?/(mol?  «s)
Therefore,  the rate constant  at the temperature  of the
experiment  is 231 L?/(mol*-«s).  The rate law equation  is
Rate = 231 L?/(mol?  « s)[CIO,|?;/0H_].
Check  Your Solution
To check your values of m and n, solve by inspection.  When [ClO] is
constant  and [OH| doubles,  the rate also doubles  and the reaction  is first
order in OH’. When [OH] is constant  and [ClO,] triples,  the rate
increases  by a factor of 9. Recall that 3? = 9, indicating  a second-order
relationship.  To check  your value of k, substitute  data from experiment
2 or 3. You should  get the same answer.  Also check the units and the
number  of significant  digits for k.
y,PROBLEM  TIP
When you set up your ratio to
compare  rates, it does not
matter  which rate is the
numerator,  and which is the
denominator.  It is often easier
to see the solution,  however,
if the larger rate is the
numerator.

The Half-Life  of a Reaction
You have seen that a large rate constant  indicates  a fast reaction,  while
a small rate constant  indicates  a slow reaction.  It is not always  easy,
however,  to determine  how long  a reaction  will take to be completed
just by looking  at the value of k. How can you relate the speed of a
reaction  to the units of s~’ for a first-order  reaction?
The half-life,  t,/2, of a reaction  is the time that is needed  for the
reactant  mass or concentration  to decrease  by one half of its initial
value. The SI units for half-life  are seconds.  Usually,  however,  half-life
is expressed  in whatever  units of time are appropriate  to the reaction.
For example,  the half-life  of a very fast reaction  may be measured  in
microseconds.  The half-life  of a slow reaction  may be measured  in days.
Knowing  the half-life  of a reaction  is an easy way to tell how fast or how
slow  a reaction  is.
Examine  Figure 6.6 to see how half-life  and reactant  concentration  are
related  for the first-order  decomposition  of dinitrogen  pentoxide.

This graph shows  [N20s] versus  time for the first three half-lives  of the
decomposition  reaction  of N20; at 44°C . The spheres  in the cubes represent  [ N,0s].
The half-life  of any first-order  reaction  is always  a constant,  and it
depends  on k. In other words,  any first-order  reaction  (that is, any reaction
with a rate law equation  in the form Rate = k[A]) has a half-life  that is
independent  of the initial concentration  of the reactant,  A. The half-life
of any first-order  reaction  can be calculated  using the following  equation.

You can use simple  collision  theory  to begin to understand  why factors complex
such as concentration  affect reaction  rate. If a collision  is necessary  for a
reaction  to occur, then it makes sense that the rate of the reaction  will
increase  if there are more collisions  per unit time. More reactant  particles
in a given volume  (that is, greater  concentration)  will increase  the number
of collisions  between  the particles  per second.  Figure 6.7 illustrates Go to the Chemistry  12

alice  mate The area under  a

graph represents  the distribution  of
the kinetic  energy  of collisions  at a
constant  temperature.  At a given
temperature,  only a certain  fraction
of the molecules  in a sample  have
enough  kinetic  energy  to react.Beyond  Collision  Theory
Simple  collision  theory  recognizes  that a collision  between  reactants
is necessary  for a reaction  to proceed.  Does every collision  result in a
reaction?  Consider  a 1 mL sample  of gas at room temperature  and
atmospheric  pressure.  In the sample,  about 10*° collisions  per second  take
place between  gas molecules.  If each collision  resulted  in a reaction,  all
gas phase reactions  would  be complete  in about a nanosecond  (107° s)—a
truly explosive  rate! As you know from section  6.2, however,  gas phase
reactions  can occur quite slowly.  This suggests  that not every collision
between  reactants  results  in a reaction.
In order for a collision  between  reactants  to result in a reaction,  the
collision  must be effective.  An effective  collision—  one that results  in the
formation  of products—must  satisfy  the following  two criteria.  You will
investigate  these criteria  over the next few pages.
For a collision  to be effective,  it must satisfy  both of these criteria:
1. correct  orientation  of reactants
2. sufficient  collision  energy
Orientation  of Reactants
Reacting  particles  must collide  with the proper  orientation  relative  to
one another.  This is also known  as having  the correct  collision  geometry.
The importance  of proper  collision  geometry  can be illustrated  by the
following  reaction.
NO we) + NO3x(Q) —> NO2z@) + NO 2)
Figure 6.9 shows  five of the many possible  ways in which  NO and NO3
can collide.  Only one of these five possibilities  has the correct  collision
geometry  for a reaction  to occur. As shown  in the figure, only a certain
orientation  of reactants  prior to collision  leads to the formation  of two
molecules  of nitrogen  dioxide.
Activation  Energy
In addition  to collision  geometry,  there is a second  factor that determines
whether  a collision  will result in a reaction:  the energy  of the collision.
The reactants  must collide  with energy  that is sufficient  to begin to break
the bonds in the reactants  and to begin to form the bonds in the products.
In most reactions,  only a small fraction  of collisions  have sufficient
energy  for a reaction  to occur. The activation  energy,  Ea, of a reaction  is
the minimum  collision  energy  that is required  for a successful  reaction.
The collision  energy  depends  on the kinetic  energy  of the colliding
particles.  As you know, temperature  is a measure  of the average  kinetic
energy  of the particles  in a substance.  If you plot the number  of collisions
in a substance  at a given temperature  against  the kinetic  energy  of
each collision,  you get a curve like the one in Figure 6.10. The type of
distribution  that is shown  by this curve is known  as a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution.  The dotted  line indicates  the activation  energy.  The shaded
part of the graph indicates  the collisions  with energy  that is equal to or
greater  than the activation  energy.
How does the distribution  of kinetic  energy  change  as the temperature
of a substance  increases?  Figure 6.11 shows  the distribution  of kinetic

For many reactions,  the rate roughly  doubles  for every 10°C rise in
temperature.
Transition  State Theory
Transition  state theory  is used to explain  what happens  when molecules
collide in a reaction.  It examines  the transition,  or change,  from reactants
to products.  The kinetic energy of the reactants  is transferred  to potential
energy  as the reactants  collide,  due to the law of conservation  of energy.
This is analogous  to a bouncing  basketball.  The kinetic  energy  of the ball
is converted  to potential  energy,  which is stored in the deformed  ball as it
hits the floor. The potential  energy  is converted  to kinetic energy  as the
ball bounces  away.
You can represent  the increase  in potential  energy  during  a chemical
reaction  using a potential  energy  diagram:  a diagram  that charts the
potential  energy  of a reaction  against  the progress  of the reaction.
Examples  of potential  energy diagrams  are shown  in Figures  6.12 and 6.13
on the next page. The y-axis represents  potential  energy.  The x-axis,
labelled  “Reaction  progress,”  represents  the progress  of the reaction
through  time.
The “hill” in each diagram  illustrates  the activation  energy  barrier
of the reaction.  A slow reaction  has a high activation  energy  barrier. This
indicates  that relatively  few reactants  have sufficient  kinetic  energy  for
a successful  reaction.  A fast reaction,  by contrast,  has a low activation
energy  barrier.
A potential  energy diagram  for an exothermic  reaction  is shown  in
Figure 6.12. The reactants  at the beginning  of the reaction  are at a higher
energy  level than the products.  The overall difference  in potential  energy
is the enthalpy  change,  AH. There is no way to predict  the activation
energy  of a reaction  from its enthalpy  change.  A highly exothermic  reac-
tion may be very slow because  it has a high activation  energy. Conversely,
a reaction  that is very fast may release  very little heat. The enthalpy
change of a reaction  is determined  by finding  the overall energy  that is
Chapter  6 Rates of Chemical  Reactions»  MHR 291
transferred.  The activation  energy  of a reaction  is determined  by analyzing
the reaction  rate.
A potential  energy  diagram  for an endothermic  reaction  is shown  in
Figure 6.13. The reactants  at the beginning  of the reaction  are at a lower
energy  level than the products.  The overall  difference  in potential  energy
between  reactants  and products  is the enthalpy  change.

You may already  know that many reactions  can proceed  in two directions.
For example,  hydrogen  and oxygen  react to form water. Water, however,
can also undergo  electrolysis,  forming  hydrogen  and oxygen.  This is the
reverse  of the first reaction.
Hag) + 50248 —+ H,O~) AH* = —-285.8 kJ
HOw > Hay) + 5 Ox AH? = 285.8 kJ
The enthalpy  change  of the first reaction  is the same as the enthalpy
change  of the second  reaction,  with the opposite  sign. (You can show
this using Hess’s law.) How are the activation  energies  of forward  and
reverse  reactions  related?  For an exothermic  reaction,  the activation
energy  of the reverse  reaction,  Eaey) equals Eafwa) + AH. For an endo-
thermic  reaction,  Eajev) equals Ea(fwa) - AH. Figures  6.12 and 6.13 show
the activation  energies  of forward  and reverse  reactions.
The top of the activation  energy  barrier  on a potential  energy  diagram
represents  the transition  state, or change-over  point, of the reaction.  The
chemical  species  that exists at the transition  state is referred  to as the
activated  complex.  The activated  complex  is a transitional  species  that is
neither  product  nor reactant.  It has partial  bonds and is highly  unstable.
There is a subtle difference  between  the transition  state and the activated
complex.  The transition  state refers to the top of the “hill” on a potential
energy  diagram.  The chemical  species  that exists at this transition  point is
called the activated  complex.

between  the O of the OH’ ion and the C atom. Simultaneously,  the C— Br
bond is weakened.
Because  the activated  complex  contains  partial bonds, it is highly
unstable.  It can either break down to form products  or it can decompose

Chemists  exploit  the temperature  dependence  of reaction  rates by
carrying  out chemical  reactions  at elevated  temperatures  to speed them
up. In organic  chemistry,  especially,  reactions  are commonly  performed
under  reflux: that is, while boiling  the reactants.  To prevent  reactants  and
products  from escaping  as gases, a water-cooled  condenser  tube is fitted to
the reaction  vessel. The tube condenses  the vapours  to liquids  and returns
them to the reaction  vessel.  Figure 6.15 shows  an experiment  performed
under  reflux.
At home, you take advantage  of the temperature  dependence  of
chemical  reactions  all the time. For example,  to keep your food fresh,
you store it in a refrigerator.  If you have ever left milk or vegetables  in
the refrigerator  for several  weeks,  however,  you have probably  observed
that refrigeration  does not stop food from spoiling.  Instead,  it decreases
the rate of the reactions  that cause spoilage.  When you want to cook your
food quickly,  you increase  the temperature  of the stove. This increases
the rate of the reactions  that take place as the food cooks.

Section  Summary
In this section,  you used collision  theory  and transition  state theory  to
explain  how reaction  rates are affected  by various  factors.  You considered
simple  reactions,  consisting  of a single-step  collision  between  reactants.
Not all reactions  are simple,  however.  In fact, most chemical  reactions
take place via several  steps, occurring  in sequence.  In the next section,
you will learn about the steps that make up reactions  and discover  how
these steps relate to reaction  rates.

Notice  that NO; is present  in both elementary  reactions,  but it is not pres-
ent in the overall  reaction.  It is produced  in the first step and consumed
in the second  step.
Molecules  (or atoms or ions) that are formed  in an elementary  reaction
and consumed  in a subsequent  elementary  reaction  are called reaction
intermediates.  Even though  they are not products  or reactants  in the over-
all reaction,  reaction  intermediates  are essential  for the reaction  to take
place. They are also useful for chemists
who are trying  to find evidence  to support  a proposed  reaction  mecha-
nism. You will explore  this idea in Investigation  6-B.
The Molecularity  of Elementary  Reactions
The term molecularity  refers to the number  of reactant  particles  (mole
cules, atoms, or ions) that are involved  in an elementary
reaction.

Rate Law Equations  for Elementary  Reactions
In section  6.2, you learned  that the rate law equation  for a chemical
reaction  cannot  be determined  just by looking  at the chemical  equation.
It must be found by experiment.  Elementary  reactions  are the exception
to this rule. For an elementary  reaction,  the exponents  in the rate law
equation  are the same as the stoichiometric  coefficients  for each reactant
in the chemical  equation.  Table 6.3 shows how rate laws correspond  to
elementary  reactions.

Proposing  and Evaluating  Mechanisms
You can take apart a grandfather  clock to take a look at its mechanism.
You can physically  examine  and take apart its gears and springs  to deter-
mine how it works.
When chemists  investigate  the mechanism  of a reaction,  they are
not so lucky. Determining  the mechanism  of a chemical  reaction  is a bit
like figuring  out how a clock works just by looking  at its face and hands.
For this reason,  reaction  mechanisms  are proposed  rather  than definitively
stated. Much of the experimental  evidence  that is obtained  to support
a mechanism  is indirect.  Researchers  need  a lot of creativity  as they
propose  and test mechanisms.
One of the ways that researchers  provide  evidence  for proposed
mechanisms  is by proving  the existence  of a reaction  intermediate.
Although  a reaction  intermediate  usually  appears  for a very short time
and cannot  be isolated,  there are other ways to show its presence.  For
example,  if a reaction  intermediate  is coloured  while other reactants  are
colourless,  a spectrophotometer  will show when the reaction  intermediate
is formed.  You may even be able to see a fleeting  colour  change  without
a spectrophotometer.
298 MHR-» Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
When chemists  propose  a mechanism,  they must satisfy  the
following  criteria:
e The equations  for the elementary  steps must combine  to give the
equation  for the overall  reaction.
e The proposed  elementary  steps must be reasonable.
e The mechanism  must support  the experimentally  determined  rate law.
The Rate-Determining  Step
How do chemists  determine  whether  a proposed  mechanism  supports  the
experimentally  determined  rate law? They must consider  how the rates of
the elementary  reactions  relate to the rate of the overall  reaction.
Elementary  reactions  in mechanisms  all have different  rates. Usually  one
elementary  reaction,  called the rate-determining  step, is much slower.
Hence,  it determines  the overall  rate.
To understand  the rate-determining  step, consider  a two-step  process.
Suppose  that you and a friend are making  buttered  toast for a large group
of people.  The first step is toasting  the bread. The second  step is buttering
the toast. Suppose  that toasting  two slices of bread takes about two
minutes,  but buttering  the toast takes only a few seconds.
The rate at which  the toast is buttered  does not have any effect on
the overall  rate of making  buttered  toast, because  it is much faster than
the rate at which  the bread is toasted.  The overall  rate of making  buttered
toast, therefore,  depends  only on the rate of toasting  the bread. In other
words,  two pieces of buttered  toast will be ready every two minutes.  This
is the same as the rate for the first step in the “buttered  toast mechanism.”
Thus, toasting  the bread is the rate-determining  step in the mechanism.
Step1 Bread — Toast (slow, rate-determining)
Step2 Toast + Butter — Buttered  toast (fast)
Now suppose  that the butter  is frozen  nearly  solid. It takes you about five
minutes  to scrape off enough  butter for one piece of toast. Pieces of toast
pile up, waiting  to be buttered.  In this case, the rate of making  buttered
toast depends  on the rate of spreading  the butter. The rate of toasting  is
fast relative  to the rate of buttering.
Step1 Bread — Toast (fast)
Step2 Toast + Frozen  butter — Buttered  toast (slow, rate-determining)
The Rate-Determining  Step and the Rate Law
How does the rate-determining  step relate to the rate law for the overall
equation?  Consider  the reaction  of nitrogen  dioxide  with chlorine.
2NO2@g)  + Clay) > 2NO2Cliy)
Experiments  show that this reaction  has the following  rate equation.
Rate = k[NOz2||Cl.|
The proposed  mechanism  for the reaction  is shown  below.
Step1 NOzg) + Clog) > NO2Clig)  + Cl) (slow)
Step 2 NOzg) + Clg) > NO2Cli) (fast)
The mechanism  seems reasonable,  because  the steps add up to give the
overall  reaction.  Both steps are plausible,  because  they are bimolecular
elementary  reactions.  Does the reaction  mechanism  support,  however,  the
experimentally  determined  rate law?
Chapter  6 Rates of Chemical  Reactions»  MHR 299
os
Rate-determining  steps can
occur anywhere  in a reaction
mechanism.  If a slow step is
not the first step of the mecha-
nism, however,  the overall rate
law is more complicated  to
determine.  One reason is that
fast reactions  occurring  early
in a mechanism  are often
reversible—both  the forward
and reverse  reactions  take
place. (You will learn more
about  these reactions  in Unit 4.)
SThe first step in the mechanism  is slow when compared  with the
second  step. Therefore,  the rate-determining  step is step 1. Since the rate
of the overall  reaction  depends  on the rate of the slow step, the rate law
equation  for the rate-determining  step should  match  the rate law for the
overall  reaction.
By definition,  the rate law equation  for step 1 is written  as follows:
Rate; = ky [NO2|  [Cl]
The rate law of the rate-determining  step in the proposed  mechanism
matches  the experimentally  determined  rate law. Since the proposed
mechanism  is consistent  with the overall  rate law equation,  it is a
reasonable  mechanism.

What Is Required?
You need to determine  whether  the proposed  mechanism  is reasonable.
To do this, you need to answer  the following  questions:
e Do the steps add up to the overall  reaction?
e Are the steps reasonable  in terms of their molecularity?
e Is the proposed  mechanism  consistent  with the experimentally

The two steps add up to give the overall  reaction.  The second  step is
bimolecular,  so it is chemically  reasonable.  The first step is termolecular,

written  as follows:
The rate law equation  for the slow step matches  the rate law equation

a em: A catalyst  lowers
the activation  energy  of a reaction
by providing  an alternative  mecha-
nism. A catalyst  also increases  the
rate of the reverse  reaction.  What
effect does a catalyst  have on AH of
a reaction?
EnergyCatalysts
A catalyst  is a substance  that increases  the rate of a chemical  reaction
without  being consumed  by the reaction.  Catalysts  are of tremendous
importance  in all facets of chemistry,  from the laboratory  to industry.
Many industrial  reactions,  for example,  would  not be economically  viable
without  catalysts.  Well over three million  tonnes  of catalysts  are produced
annually  in North America.
How a Catalyst  Works
A catalyst  works by lowering  the activation  energy  of a reaction  so that a
larger fraction  of the reactants  have sufficient  energy  to react. It lowers  the
activation  energy  by providing  an alternative  mechanism  for the reaction.
The potential  energy  diagram  in Figure 6.18 shows the activation  energy
for an uncatalyzed  reaction  and the activation  energy  for the same
reaction  with the addition  of a catalyst.

In Figure 6.18, the catalyzed  reaction  consists  of a two-step  mechanism.
The uncatalyzed  reaction  consists  of a one-step  mechanism.  To see how
a catalyst  works,  in general,  consider  a simple,  one-step,  bimolecular
reaction:
A+B-— AB
A catalyst  can increase  the rate of this reaction  by providing  an alternative
mechanism  with lower activation  energy.  A possible  mechanism  for the
catalyzed  reaction  is shown  below.
Step 1
Step 2
Overall  reactionA + catalyst — A—catalyst
A— catalyst  + B > AB + catalyst
A+B-—  AB
Both steps are faster than the original,  uncatalyzed  reaction.  Therefore,
although  the overall  reaction  of the catalyzed  mechanism  has the same
reactants  and products  as the uncatalyzed  reaction,  the catalyzed  mecha-
nism is faster. The chemical  species A — catalyst  is a reaction  intermediate.
It is produced  in step 1 but consumed  in step 2. By contrast,  the catalyst
is regenerated  in the reaction.  It appears  as a reactant  in step 1 and as
302 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of Reaction
a product  in step 2. Although  the catalyst  changes  during  the overall
reaction,  it is regenerated  unchanged  at the end of the overall  reaction.
Figure 6.19 shows  the reaction  of sodium  potassium  tartrate  with
H,O2, catalyzed  by cobaltous  chloride,  CoCl,. The CoCl, is pink in solu-
tion. Notice  that the contents  of the beaker  briefly  change  colour  to dark
green, suggesting  the formation  of a reaction  intermediate.  Also notice  that
you can see the regeneration  of the catalyst  when the reaction  is over.
Catalysts  are divided  into two categories,  depending  on whether  or not
they are in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous  Catalysts
A homogeneous  catalyst  exists in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous  catalysts  most often catalyze  gaseous  and aqueous
reactions.  For example,  aqueous  zinc chloride,  ZnCly,  is used to catalyze
the following  reaction.
ZNClo(aq)
(CH3)2CHOH  (aq) + HCleag)  ———_  (CH3)2CHCliag)  + H2,0(e)
The reaction  takes place in aqueous  solution,  and the catalyst  is soluble  in
water. Therefore,  ZnCl, is a homogeneous  catalyst  when it is used with
this reaction.
Heterogeneous  Catalysts
A heterogeneous  catalyst  exists in a phase that is different  from the phase
of the reaction  it catalyzes.  An important  industrial  use of heterogeneous
catalysts  is the addition  of hydrogen  to an organic  compound  that
contains  C=C double  bonds.  This process  is called hydrogenation.
Consider  the hydrogenation  of ethylene,  shown  below.
Pdis)
H.C = CHa(g) + Hog) — H3C — CH3(g)
Without  a catalyst,  the reaction  is very slow. When  the reaction  is catalyzed
by a metal such as palladium  or platinum,  however,  the rate increases
dramatically.  The ethylene  and hydrogen  molecules  form bonds with the
metal surface.  This weakens  the bonds of the hydrogen  and ethylene.  The
H—H  bonds of the hydrogen  molecules  break, and the hydrogen  atoms are
somewhat  stabilized  because  of their attraction  to the metal. The hydrogen
atoms react with the ethylene,  forming  ethane.  Figure 6.20 shows  the
hydrogenation  of ethylene  to ethane.

Hydrogenation  is used in the food industry  to convert  liquid vegetable
oils, which  contain  carbon-carbon  double  bonds,  to solid fats, such as
shortening,  which  are fully saturated.
Biological  Catalysts
Your body depends  on reactions  that are catalyzed  by amazingly  efficient
and specific  biological  catalysts.  Biological  catalysts  are enormous  protein
molecules  called enzymes.  Their molecular  masses  range from 15 000 to
1 000 000 g/mol.
Only a small portion  of the enzyme,  called the active site, is actually
involved  in the catalysis  reaction.  In terms of the enzyme’s  overall  shape,
the active site is like a nook or a fold in its surface.  The reactant  molecule,
called the substrate  in an enzyme  reaction,  binds to the active site. The
enzyme  works  by stabilizing  the reaction’s  transition  state.
Two models  currently  exist to explain  how an enzyme  and its substrate
interact.  One model,  called the lock and key model,  suggests  that an
enzyme  is like a lock, and its substrate  is like a key. The shape of the active
site on the enzyme  exactly  fits the shape of the substrate. A second  model,
called the induced  fit model,  suggests  that the active site of an enzyme
changes  its shape to fit its substrate.  Figure 6.21 shows  both models.

Enzymes  are involved  in many functions  of the human  body, including
digestion  and metabolism.  For example,  the enzyme  lactase  is responsible
for catalyzing  the breakdown  of lactose,  a sugar found in milk. People
who are lactose-intolerant  are usually  missing  lactase,  or they have insuf-
ficient  amounts.  If you are lactose-intolerant,  you can take commercially
produced  supplements  that contain  lactase.

which  industries  use and produce  catalysts.

Many reactions  that produce  useful compounds
proceed  too slowly  to be used in industries.
Some reactions  need to be carried  out at high
temperatures  or pressures  to proceed  quickly.
These conditions,  however,  are often expensive  to
maintain.  Therefore,  chemists  and engineers  use
catalysts  to speed up the reactions  in order to obtain
products  at a reasonable  rate and under reasonable
conditions.  Similarly,  many necessary  biological
reactions  would proceed  too slowly  to sustain life
without  the presence  of enzymes.

initial research.)  Two examples  in each category
are given below.

2. Choose  one catalyst  and one enzyme  from each
brainstormed  list.
3. Using electronic  and print resources,  research
your substances.
4, Prepare  a brief report about each substance.
Your report should  include  answers  to the
Analysis  questions  below. If you prefer, present
your research  as a web page.5. Include  a list of the sources  you used. You should
include  at least three electronic  sources  and one
print source  for each substance.
Analysis
1. Your report about industrial  catalysts  should
answer  the following  questions.
(a) What is the chemical  formula  of the catalyst?
Is the catalyst  heterogeneous  or
homogeneous?
(b) What process  does the catalyst  speed up?
Include  products,  reactants,  the reaction
mechanism  (if possible),  and information
about  the uncatalyzed  reaction.
(c) What technology  is required  to support  the
catalyzed  reaction  (for example,  the design
of a catalytic  converter)?
(d) What is the importance  and relevance,  to
Canadians,  of the industry  associated  with
the catalyst?
2. Your report about enzymes  should  answer  the
questions  below.
(a) What chemical  process  is the enzyme
involved  in?
(b) How does the enzyme  fit into an overall
biological  process?
(c) Are there any ways in which the enzyme  can
be prevented  from doing its job? Explain.
(d) Is the enzyme  mass-produced  by industry?
If so, how? For what purpose is it
mass-produced?
In the Thought  Lab above,  you may have included  the enzyme  catalase
in your brainstormed  list. Catalase  in your blood is responsible  for the
“fizzing”  you see when you use a dilute hydrogen  peroxide  solution  to
disinfect  a cut. When dilute hydrogen  peroxide  is poured  on a cut, it
decomposes  to oxygen  gas and water. The decomposition  reaction  is
catalyzed  by catalase.
Have you ever opened  an old bottle of hydrogen  peroxide  and noticed
that it has lost its potency?  The hydrogen  peroxide  has decomposed,  leav-
ing you with a bottle of water. At room temperature,  in the absence  of a
catalyst,  the decomposition  of H,O, occurs  very slowly,  over a period of
months  or years. With the help of a catalyst,  however,  the rate of the reac-
tion can be increased  to the point where it can be easily studied  in a high
school  laboratory.
In Investigation  6-B, you will write a detailed  procedure  to determine
the rate law for the catalyzed  decomposition  of hydrogen  peroxide.  Instead
of using catalase  to catalyze  the reaction,  you will use an inorganic  catalyst.

Canadians  } in Chemistry
Dr. Maud L. Menten
Dr. Maud L. Menten,  a leading  researcher  in the field
of biochemistry,  was born in Port Lambton,  Ontario,
in 1879. She grew up in rural British Columbia,  where
she had to take a canoe across  the Fraser River every
day to get to school.  Later, Menten  returned  to
Ontario  to attend  the University  of Toronto.  Upon
receiving  her medical  degree  in 1911, she became
one of the first female  doctors  in Canada.
Menten  soon received  international  recognition
for her study of enzymes.  From 1912 to 1913, she
worked  at Leonor  Michaelis’  lab at the University  of
Berlin. While conducting  experiments  on the break-
down of sucrose  by the enzyme  called invertase,
Menten  and Michaelis  were able to refine the work
of Victor Henri to explain  how enzymes  function.  A
few years earlier, Henri had proposed  that enzymes
bind directly  to their substrates.  Michaelis  and
Menten  obtained  the precise  measurements  that
were needed  to support  Henri’s  hypothesis.  Using
the recently  developed  concept  of pH, they were
able to buffer  their chemical  reactions  and thereby
control  the conditions  of their experiments  more
Section  Summarysuccessfully  than Henri. Their findings,  published  in
1913, provided  the first useful model of enzyme
function.
In the ground-breaking  scientific  paper  that
presented  their work, Menten  and Michaelis  also
derived  an important  mathematical  formula.  This
formula  describes  the rate at which enzymes  break
down their substrates.  It correlates  the speed of
the enzyme  reaction  with the concentrations  of
the enzyme  and the substrate.  Called  the Michaelis-
Menten  equation,  it remains  fundamental  to our
understanding  of how enzymes  catalyze  reactions.
Menten  remained  an avid researcher  all her life.
She worked  long days, dividing  her time between
teaching  at the University  of Pittsburgh’s  School
of Medicine  and working  as a pathologist  at the
Children’s  Hospital  of Pittsburgh.  She also worked
with her peers and students  on more than 70 papers
that dealt with a wide range of medical  topics. In
addition  to her work with Michaelis,  Menten’s  contri-
butions  to science  include  pioneering  techniques  for
studying  the chemical  composition  of tissues  and
for investigating  the nature of hemoglobin  in human
red blood cells.
It was not until 1949, only a year before retiring
from the University  of Pittsburgh,  that Menten
obtained  a full professorship.  Shortly  after retiring,
Menten  joined  the Medical  Research  Institute  of
British Columbia  to do cancer  research.  Sadly, ill
health forced her to cease her scientific  work only
a few years later. She spent her remaining  days in
Leamington,  Ontario.
Although  she was  a brilliant  medical  researcher,
Menten’s  enthusiasm  overflowed  beyond  the
boundaries  of science.  She was a world traveller,
a mountain  climber,  a musician,  and a student  of
languages.  She was even a painter,  whose  work
made its way into art exhibitions.
In honour  of her lifetime  of achievements,
Maud L. Menten  was inducted  into the Canadian
Medical  Hall of Fame in 1998.
In this section,  you learned  that chemical  reactions  usually  proceed  as a
series of steps called elementary  reactions.  You related  the equations  for
elementary  reactions  to rate laws. You learned  how the relative  speed of
the steps in a reaction  mechanism  help to predict  the rate law of an over-
all reaction.  Finally,  you learned  howa catalyst  controls  the rate of a
chemical  reaction  by providing  a lower-energy  reaction  mechanism.  In
this chapter,  you compared  activation  energies  of forward  and reverse
reactions.  In the next unit, you will study, in detail,  reactions  that proceed
in both directions.

10) Historians  suspect  that many ancient  Romans  suffered  from lead
poisoning.  The ancient  Romans  used lead for their plumbing  system
(hence,  the Latin name for the element).  Lead is a poison  because  it
can form strong bonds with proteins,  including  enzymes.  Lead and
other heavy metals react with enzymes  by binding  to functional  groups
on their active sites. When lead binds to a protein,  such as an enzyme,
the protein  often precipitates  out of solution.

LEY TELS AT STATIONERS  MALL.)
Background
Scientists  have studied  the amazing  properties  of
enzymes  and catalysts  for more than 200 years.
In 1794, the English  chemist  Elizabeth  Fulhame
published  a book called  An Essay  on Combustion.
Her book included  many of the first recorded  ideas
about the role of catalysis  in chemical  processes.
In particular,  Fulhame  was interested  in the
catalytic  properties  of the hydrogen  and oxygen
atoms in water.
Fulhame’s  ideas about inorganic  catalysts  were
swept  under  by the fast and furious  debate of her
scientific  era. Many of the most prominent  scientists
of her day were arguing  over whether  organic
reactions  needed  living organisms  to occur. Many
scientists  believed  that a vital force was present
in living organisms  and was essential  for the
formation  of all organic  compounds.  For example,
the fermentation  of sugar into alcohol  takes place
through  the action of yeast, a living organism.
314 MHR- Unit 3 Energy  Changes  and Rates of ReactionScientists  argued  that it was impossible  to produce
alcohol,  an organic  compound,  without  the action
of yeast, or some other living organism.
Although  no one realized  it at the time,
Fulhame’s  ideas on catalysts  were directly  relevant
to the debate on vital force. There is no mysterious
vital force in living organisms.  Instead,  organic
reactions  in living organisms  depend  on organic
catalysts  called enzymes.
In 1828, the German  chemist  Friedrich  Wohler
discovered  that urea, an organic  compound,  could
be produced  in a laboratory  without  any help from
a living organism.  Wohler’s  discovery  inspired
other scientists  to hypothesize  that the fermentation
of sugar into alcohol  could also occur without  the
presence  of living organisms,  such as yeast. Some
scientists  went further,  and insisted  that yeast was
not even a living organism.
Urea
Eventually,  scientists  proved  that fermentation
did not require  whole cells of yeast. Fermentation
could still occur if non-living  extracts  of yeast were
present.  Through  further  study and experimentation,
the important  component  in the yeast extract  was
identified  as an enzyme.  If earlier  scientists  had
considered  Fulhame’s  ideas on catalysts,  they might
have arrived  at the truth about enzymes  sooner!
Over time, scientists  have built up a large body
of knowledge  about many different  catalysts  and
enzymes.  This knowledge  has been put to good
use in industry.  Difficult  and expensive  industrial
processes  have been made faster, cheaper,  and
easier through  the use of catalysts  and enzymes.  For
example,  enzymes  are used in the pharmaceutical
industry,  in paper-making  and recycling  processes,
and in the petroleum  industry.  Many more industrial
uses of catalysts  and enzymes  are possible,  and
research  into catalysts  continues.
In this project,  you will research  some of
the many catalysts  and enzymes  that are used
in Canadian  industries.  Then you will create an
information  bulletin  to present  your findings.
Challenge
Design,  produce,  and distribute  an information
bulletin  to inform  your community  about the use
of catalysts  or enzymes  in Canadian  industries.
Choose  one or more of the following  options:
e If there is a local industry  you can study, focus
on different  aspects  of this industry’s  use of
catalysts.
e Study a catalyst  that is used by several
different  industries.
¢ Compile  a variety  of uses of catalysts  and
enzymes  across Canada.
e Analyze  a cutting-edge  technology  that involves
catalysts  or enzymes.
e Analyze  the historical  development  and use of a
particular  enzyme  or catalyst.
Materials
Set up your information  bulletin  in the format  of a
brochure  or leaflet, suitable  to be distributed  to
classmates  and other students  in your school.
Alternatively,  present  your information  bulletin  as a
web page, so that you can share your research  with
a wider audience.
Design  Criteria
A As aclass,  develop  a product  rubric  to assess
the bulletins.  For example,  you may wish
to evaluate  how interesting  the bulletins  are,
or whether  they are easy for non-chemistry
students  to understand.
B) Your bulletin  should  be interesting,  visually
attractive,  factual,  and aimed  at a wide audience.
Action  Plan
1) Decide  whether  you will work on your own,
with a partner,  or as part of a small group.
2) Decide  what you want your bulletin  to look
like. The following  questions  will help you
decide  on a format.
e How many topics will you cover in your
bulletin?
¢ How long will each article  in your bulletin  be?Assessment
After you complete  this project,  answer  the following
questions  to assess  your work.
= Assess  the interest  level of the information  you
gathered.  Did you obtain information  of interest  to
Grade 12 chemistry  students?  Did you obtain
information  of interest  to non-science  students?
= Assess  the scientific  accuracy  and complexity  of
the information  you gathered.  Did you use at least
three major sources?  If you used web sites, were
they run by reputable  organizations?  Did you
include  information  above and beyond  the content
of this course?
m Assess  your communication  skills. Did you explain
detailed  chemical  information  in a clear and
understandable  way?
e Will you study a local industry,  or cover a
variety  of Canadian  industries?
e Will you examine  one enzyme  or catalyst  in
detail, or will you give an overview  of many
different  catalysts  and/or  enzymes?
e How can you ensure  that your bulletin  is
visually  attractive  and interesting?
¢e How can you motivate  readers?  For example,
you may want to include  activities  (such as
puzzles  and quizzes)  or a brief list of
interesting  facts.
3) If you are working  as part of a group, assign  a
task to each member  of the group.
Evaluate
Print out your bulletin.  Display  it on a poster  board
in a hallway  of your school,  or in a local public
building.  If your bulletin  is in the form of a web
page, present  it to the class and then post it on the
Internet  or on your school’s  Intranet.

P., ctocnromic lenses darken in
sunlight  and then gradually  clear
in shade and dim light. The change
is permanent  in constant  light
conditions,  yet reversible  if the
light intensity  changes.  How?
The molten  glass contains
dissolved  silver chloride.  As the
solution  cools, silver chloride
precipitates,  forming  tiny silver
chloride  crystals.  Light striking
these crystals  produces  silver and
chlorine  atoms. The silver atoms
tend to clump together  to form
particles  that are big enough  to
block light and darken  the glass.
Adding  copper(I)  chloride  to
the molten  glass makes  the process
reversible.  When light intensity
diminishes,  copper  ions remove
electrons  from silver atoms, convert-
ing the silver atoms into silver ions.
The silver ions then migrate  back
to the silver chloride  crystals.  The
glass becomes  transparent  again.
Most of the reactions  that you
have studied  have essentially  gone
to completion.  You can use stoi-
chiometry  to calculate  the amounts
of products  formed,  assuming  that
the chemical  reaction  proceeds  only
from left to right. In many chemical

reactants  and products  form because

nitrogen  directly  from the atmosphere.  You get the nitrogen-containing
compounds  you need by eating plants and other foods.
Plants cannot  absorb  nitrogen  directly  from the atmosphere,  either.
Their roots absorb  nitrogen  compounds—mainly  nitrates—from  the soil.
Some of these nitrates  result from atmospheric  chemical  reactions  that
involve  nitrogen  and oxygen.  First, lightning  supplies  the energy  that is
needed  to form nitric oxide from nitrogen  and oxygen.  The resulting  nitric
oxide combines  with oxygen  to form nitrogen  dioxide,  which  reacts with
rainwater  to form nitric acid. Then, in the seas and the soil at Earth’s
surface,  nitric acid ionizes  to produce  nitrate,  NO;. Plants and plant-like
organisms  can readily  absorb  nitrate.
Scientists  call this chemical  “circle of life” the nitrogen  cycle. There
are, as you know, similar,  equally  important  cyclic processes  in nature.
Each process  involves  reversible  changes:  changes  that may proceed  in
either direction,  from reactants  to products  or from products  to reactants.
In this chapter,  you will study factors  that affect reversible  changes,
notably  those in chemical  reactions.  You will learn how to determine  the
amounts  of reactants  and products  that are present  when their proportions
no longer  change.  You will also learn how to make qualitative  predictions
about the ways that chemists  can change  these proportions.  Finally,  you
will see how industrial  chemists  apply their knowledge  of reversible
changes  to increase  the yield of chemicals  that are important  to society.

Recognizing  Equilibrium
In Unit 3, you learned  that the rate of any reaction  depends  on the
concentration  of the reacting  chemicals.  As a reaction  proceeds,  the
concentrations  of the “product”  chemicals  increases,  and the reverse
reaction  may re-form  “reactants.”  Under  certain  conditions,  the rate of
the reverse  reaction  increases  as the rate of the forward  reaction  decreases.
Eventually,  the rate of the forward  reaction  equals  the rate of the reverse
reaction.  Equilibrium  occurs  when opposing  changes,  such as those just
described,  are occurring  simultaneously  at the same rate.
How can you recognize  equilibrium?  In the following  paragraphs,  you
will read about physical  changes  that may or may not involve  a system
at equilibrium.  As you consider  these changes,  note which  systems  are at
equilibrium  and what changes  are taking  place. Also note the conditions
that would  be needed  for the changes  to occur in the opposite  direction  at
the same rate. The ExpressLab  that follows  these descriptions  will add to
your understanding  of equilibrium.  It will help you recognize  systems  that
are at equilibrium  and systems  that are not.
e A puddle  of water remains  after a summer  shower.  The puddle  evapo-
rates because  some of the water molecules  near the surface  have enough
kinetic  energy  to escape  from the liquid.  At the same time, some water
molecules  in the air may condense  back into the liquid. The chance
of this happening  is small, however.  The puddle  soon evaporates
completely,  as shown  in Figure 7.1(A).
e Even if you put a lid on a jar of water, some of the water in the jar
evaporates.  Careful  measurements  show that the level of liquid water
in the jar initially  decreases  because  more water evaporates  than
condenses.  As the number  of water vapour  molecules  increases,
however,  some condense  back into the liquid.  Eventually,  the number
of evaporating  molecules  and the number  of condensing  molecules
are equal. The level of water inside the jar remains  constant.  At this
point, shown  in Figure 7.1(B), equilibrium  has been reached.

e Crystals  of copper(II)  sulfate pentahydrate,  CuSO,  « 5H2O, are blue. If
you place a few small crystals  in a beaker  of water, water molecules
break apart the ions and they enter into the solution.  A few ions in
the solution  may re-attach  to the crystals.  Because  more ions enter the
solution  than re-attach  to the crystals,  however,  all the solid eventually
dissolves.  If you keep adding  crystals  of copper(II)  sulfate pentahydrate,
the solution  eventually  becomes  saturated.  Crystals  remain  at the
bottom  of the beaker,  as shown  in Figure 7.2.
Which of these systems,  (A) or (B), is at equilibrium?  Will changing  the
temperature  affect the concentration  of the solution  in the equilibrium  system?

was left to return slowly  to room temperature.  In Figure 7.3(B), a single
crystal  of sodium  acetate  has been added  to the supersaturated  solution.
As you can see, solute ions rapidly  leave the solution,  and solid forms.

Explain  your answer.Conditions  That Apply to All Equilibrium  Systems
The fundamental  requirement  for equilibrium  is that opposing  changes
must occur at the same rate. There are many processes  that reach
equilibrium.  Three physical  processes  that reach equilibrium  are
e a solid in contact  with a solution  that contains  this solid: for example,
sugar crystals  in a saturated  aqueous  sugar solution
e the vapour  above a pure liquid:  for example,  a closed  jar that contains
liquid  water
e the vapour  above a pure solid: for example,  mothballs  in a closed  drawer
Two chemical  processes  that reach equilibrium  are
e areaction  with reactants  and products  in the same phase: for example,
a reaction  between  two gases to produce  a gaseous  product.  In this
chapter,  you will focus on reactions  in which  the reactants  and
products  are in the same phase. The equilibrium  they reach is called
homogeneous  equilibrium.
e a reaction  in which  reactants  and products  are in different  phases:
for example,  an aqueous  solution  of ions, in which  the ions combine  to
produce  a slightly  soluble  solid that forms a precipitate.  In Chapters  8
and 9, you will work extensively  with reactions  in which  the reactants
and products  are in different  phases.  The equilibrium  they reach is
called  heterogeneous  equilibrium.
What is it that equilibrium  systems  like these have in common?  What con-
ditions  are necessary  for equilibrium  to become  established?  As outlined
in the box below,  there are four conditions  that apply to all equilibrium
systems.
The Four Conditions  That Apply to All Equilibrium  Systems
1. Equilibrium  is achieved  in a reversible  process  when the rates of
opposing  changes  are equal. A double  arrow, =, indicates  reversible
changes.  For example:
H20(e) = H20¢)
Hoag) + Clog) = 2HC](g)
2. The observable  (macroscopic)  properties  of a system  at equilibrium
are constant.  At equilibrium,  there is no overall  change  in the
properties  that depend  on the total quantity  of matter  in the
system.  Examples  of these properties  include  colour,  pressure,
concentration,  and pH.
You can summarize  the first two equilibrium  conditions  by stating  that
equilibrium  involves  dynamic  change  at the molecular  level but no change
at the macroscopic  level.
3. Equilibrium  can only be reached  in a closed system.  A closed system
is a system  that does not allow the input or escape  of any component
of the equilibrium  system,  including  energy.  For this reason,  a
system  can be at equilibrium  only if it is at constant  temperature.
A common  example  of a closed system  is carbon  dioxide  gas that
is in equilibrium  with dissolved  carbon  dioxide  in a soda drink.
326 MHR  = Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
The system  remains  at equilibrium  as long as the container  is not
opened.  Note that small changes  to the components  of a system  are
sometimes  negligible.  Thus, equilibrium  principles  can be applied
if a system  is not physically  closed.  For example,  consider  the
equilibrium  of a solid in a saturated  aqueous  solution,  such as
CaOjs) + HO) = Ca**(ag) + 20H (aq). You can neglect  the small
amount  of water that vaporizes  from the open beaker  during  an
experiment.
4. Equilibrium  can be approached  from either direction.  For example,
the proportions  of Ha), Cla), and HCl) (in a closed container  at
constant  temperature)  are the same at equilibrium,  regardless  of
whether  you started  with Hy) and Cli.) or whether  you started
with HCl.
Section  Summary
In this section,  you learned  how to recognize  equilibrium.  As well,
you learned  about the conditions  that are needed  for equilibrium  to be
reached.  Later in this chapter,  you will examine  what happens  when
some equilibrium  conditions  in a system  are changed.  You will learn
how chemists  can control  conditions  to increase  the yield of reactions.
Energy  is an important  component  of most equilibrium  systems.  The
input or output  of energy  in a system  causes  the temperature  to change.
Thus, the requirement  that an equilibrium  system  be closed  means that
the temperature  of the system  must remain  constant.  In the next section,
you will examine  more closely  the effects of thermodynamics  on
equilibrium  systems.  In particular,  you will examine  the factors  that
affect the amount  of reactant  and product  in a reaction  and the
factors  that determine  whether  or not a reaction  is spontaneous.

You can easily predict  what will happen  in a number  of physical  and
chemical  processes.  What will happen  if you let go of a pencil  that you
are holding  tip-down  on a table? What will you observe  if you add a few
drops of food colouring  to some water in a glass? If a piece of paper starts
to burn in a plentiful  supply  of air, what are the products  of the reaction?
How will an iron nail change  if it is left outside?  These are all examples
of favourable  (or spontaneous)  changes.  A favourable  change  is a change
that has a natural  tendency  to happen  under  certain  conditions.
What Conditions  Favour  a Change?
What conditions  determine  whether  or not a change  is favourable?  How
are different  conditions  related  to equilibrium,  where forward  and reverse
changes  occur at the same rate? The answers  to these questions  are linked
to two important  concepts  in thermodynamics:  enthalpy  and entropy.
Enthalpy  and Favourable  Changes
Energy  is a key condition  in favourable  changes.  For example,  you know
that a ball always  rolls downhill.  Its gravitational  potential  energy  is
lower at the bottom  of the hill than at the top. For the ball to roll uphill—
an unfavourable  (or non-spontaneous)  change—you  have to apply energy
to the ball. Chemical  reactions  are similar.  When products  have less
enthalpy  than reactants,  the reaction  releases  energy.  Therefore,  the
reaction  is exothermic.  Are favourable  changes  those that are exothermic
under certain  conditions?
Certainly  many favourable  physical  and chemical  changes  are
exothermic.  Some favourable  changes,  however,  involve  no release  of
energy.  Others  are actually  endothermic.  For example,  a favourable
endothermic  chemical  reaction  occurs  when barium  hydroxide  and
ammonium  thiocyanate  are placed  in an Erlenmeyer  flask, as shown
in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH),  « 8H2O(4) + 2NHASCN(g)  > Ba(SCN)o(aq)  + 10H20(¢)  + 2NH 3)
AH = +170 kJ
When  the flask is stoppered  and the contents  are shaken,  the solids
intermingle.  The reaction  produces  a slush-like  mixture.  This favourable,
but endothermic,  reaction  absorbs  enough  energy  to freeze a thin layer of
water  under  the flask.
328 =MHR-* Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
Temperature  and Favourable  Changes
Another  condition  that determines  whether  or not a particular  reaction  is
favoured  is temperature.  Consider  the reversible  synthesis  reaction
between  mercury  and oxygen,  and the decomposition  of mercury(II)  oxide.
Hgie) + + Onig) = HgO;) AH =+90.8  kJ
From left to right, the reaction  is exothermic.  Therefore,  the enthalpy
change,  AH, is negative.  If the enthalpy  change  was the only condition
that determined  whether  a reaction  is favourable,  then the synthesis
reaction  would  take place. The synthesis  reaction  does take place—but
only at relatively  moderate  temperatures.  Above  400°C,  the reverse
reaction  is favourable.  The decomposition  of HgO;,) occurs.  Thus, the
direction  in which  this reaction  proceeds  depends  on temperature.
This is fundamentally  different  from the dependence  of reaction  rate
on temperature  that you learned  about in Unit 3. The reaction  between
Hg), Oz), and HgO;,) does not just change  its rate with a change  in
temperature,  it changes  its direction.
Temperature  and Enthalpy  Alone
Cannot  Explain  Favourable  Reactions
Temperature  and enthalpy  are not the only conditions  that determine
whether  a change  is favourable.  Consider  the process  shown  in Figure 7.5.
A closed  valve links two flasks together.  The left flask contains  an ideal
gas. The right flask is evacuated.  When  the valve is opened,  you expect  the
gas to diffuse  into the evacuated  flask until the pressure  in both flasks is
equal. You do not expect  to see the reverse  process—with  all the gas mole-
cules ending  up in one of the flasks—unless  work is done on the system.
flask with ideal gas evacuated  flask ideal gas in both flasks
closed  valve open valve
If the gas is ideal, this favourable  change  involves  no change  in energy.  Why
must the gas be ideal?
The process  shown  in Figure 7.5 is certainly  a favourable  change.  Yet no
exchange  of energy  is involved.  The condition  that influences  this change
is called entropy.  It is an important  condition  in all physical  and chemical
changes.
Entropy  and Favourable  Changes
Entropy,  S, is the tendency  toward  randomness  or disorder  in a system.
It is also a thermodynamic  property  that can be measured.  It can be used
to describe  qualitative  changes  in energy.
An ordered  arrangement  of particles  (atoms,  ions, or molecules)  has
lower entropy  (smaller  disorder)  than the same number  of particles  in
random  arrangements.  Thus, the entropy  of a pure substance  depends  on
its state. The entropy  of a system  increases  (becomes  more disordered)
with temperature,  because  the motion  of particles  becomes  more chaotic
at higher  temperatures.  See Figure 7.6 on the next page.
Chapter  7 Reversible  Reactions  and Chemical  Equilibrium  * MHR 329
increasing  entropy
The entropy  of the particles  in a sample  of matter increases  as the matter
changes  state from solid to liquid to gas.
The mathematical  definition  of entropy  describes  the probability  of a
given arrangement  of particles. A system  of moving  particles  with low
entropy  probably  has greater  order than a similar  system  with higher
entropy.  Why say “probably”?  Consider  gas molecules  in a container  at
room temperature.  The gas molecules  are moving  rapidly,  colliding  with
other molecules  and the walls of the container.  They have relatively  large
entropy.  What if two different  gases occupy  the same container’?  It is pos-
sible, in principle,  for the gases to separate  so they are on opposite  sides
of the container.  Given  the huge number  of particles,  however,  the proba-
bility of this happening  is so close to zero that chemists  say it will never
happen.  Nevertheless,  it remains  possible.  The outcome  is not certain.
As you know from Unit 3, chemists  often use the terms “system”  and
“surroundings”  to describe  a chemical  reaction.  The system  is the reaction
itself—the  reactants  and products.  The surroundings  are everything  else
in the universe.  According  to the first law of thermodynamics  (the law
of conservation  of energy)  the algebraic  sum of the energy  changes  in
a system  and its surroundings  is zero. Unlike  energy,  entropy  is not
conserved.  The total amount  of entropy  is increasing.  This is part of the
second  law of thermodynamics:  the total entropy  of the universe  is
constantly  increasing.  The key word here is “total.”  If you are studying
a system,  you must add together  changes  in the entropy  of the system,
AS.y;, and changes  in the entropy  of the surroundings,  ASsurr.
Consider  what happens  to you and your classmates  (the particles  in a
“system”)  on your way to class. Initially,  you and your classmates  are in
different  places in the school,  walking  with different  velocities  toward  the
classroom.  Going to class represents  a relatively  large amount  of entropy.
The final state of the system,  when everyone  is seated,  represents  a
330 =MHR- Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
smaller  amount  of entropy.  Thus, the entropy  of the system  decreased.
How, then, did the entropy  of the universe  increase?
The answer  to this question  involves  changes  to the surroundings.
Each of you, on your way to class, metabolized  energy.  The movement
and heat from your bodies  added  to the entropy  of the air particles  around
you. In fact, the increase  in the entropy  of the surroundings  was greater
than the decrease  in the entropy  of the system.  Therefore,  the total
entropy  of the universe  increased.
What does entropy  have to do with favourable  chemical  changes  and
equilibrium  systems?  All favourable  changes  involve  an increase  in the
total amount  of entropy.  Recall  the endothermic  reaction  in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH),  « 8H20(s) + 2NHASCN(.)  > Ba(SCN)2(aq)  + 10H20¢)  + 2NH3¢g)
AH =+170  kJ
The reaction  is favourable,  partly  because  the reactants  are two solids and
the products  are a solution,  water, and a gas. The products  have a much
larger entropy  than the reactants.  This helps to make the reaction
favourable.
Now recall the reaction  between  mercury  and oxygen.  It favours
the formation  of HgO below  about 400°C,  but the decomposition  of HgO
above 400°C. This reaction  highlights  the importance  of temperature  to
favourable  change.  Enthalpy,  entropy,  and temperature  are linked  in a
concept  called free energy.
Free Energy  and Equilibrium
Imagine  a perfect  engine—an  engine  without  any friction  between  its
moving  parts. This engine  would  still be unable  to convert  all the energy
in a fuel into useful work. The reason  is that some energy,  such as the
energy  of the hot exhaust,  is used to increase  the entropy  of the surround-
ings. The term free energy  means  available  energy.  In a chemical  change,
free energy  is a measure  of the useful work that can be obtained  from a
reaction.  Free energy  is often called Gibbs  free energy,  and given the
symbol  G, in honour  of Josiah  Willard  Gibbs (1839-1903).  Gibbs, a
professor  of chemistry  at Harvard  University,  developed  the concept
of free energy  and the equations  that describe  it.
The change  in the free energy  of a system,  AG, at constant  temperature
is given by the equation  AG = AH — TAS. In this equation,  as in most
chemistry  equations,  the temperature,  T, must be in Kelvin  degrees.  The
symbol  AH represents  the change  in enthalpy.  The symbol  AS represents
the change  in entropy.

The concept  of free energy
The value of AG for a chemical  reaction  tells us whether  the reaction  is a appears  in other areas of

Find out the meanings  of
the terms “exergonic”  and
“andergonic.”  How are these
terms related  to free energy?such as mechanical  energy  to drive machinery  or electrical  energy  in a
battery.  The rest of the energy  from the reaction  enters the environment  as
heat. It increases  the entropy  of the surroundings.
Chapter  7 Reversible  Reactions  and Chemical  Equilibrium  * MHR_ 331
The equation  AG = AH — TAS, and the sign of AG, can help to explain
why some chemical  reactions  are favourable  at room temperature,  why
others are not, and how temperature  affects the direction  of a reaction.
The change  in the free energy  of a chemical  reaction  is related
to the direction  of the reaction  and to equilibrium  as follows:
e When  AG is negative,  the forward  reaction  is favourable.
e When  AG is zero, the reaction  is at equilibrium.
e When AG is positive,  the reaction  is favourable  in the reverse  direction
but not in the forward  direction.
Exothermic  reactions  are often favourable  because  the sign of AH is
negative.  The equation  shows that exothermic  reactions  are unfavourable
only when AS is negative  and the value of —TAS is large enough  to make
AG positive.  This is what happens  in the reaction  between  mercury
and oxygen.
Hg + $02) > HgO) AH = -90.8 kJ
From left to right, the reaction  is exothermic.  There is a decrease  in
entropy  because  gas molecules  react to form a solid. At temperatures
greater  than about 400°C (673 K), the value of —TAS is positive  and greater
than 90.8 kJ. Thus, AG becomes  positive.  The forward  reaction  is no
longer  favourable,  as experiments  confirm.
In most reactions,  the entropy  of the system  increases  (S is positive),
so the value of —TAS is negative.  Therefore,  most reactions  tend to be
more favourable  at higher  temperatures.  At low temperatures,  reactions
are likely to be favourable  only if they are highly  exothermic.
Section  Summary
Table 7.1 shows how you can use the signs of AH and AS to determine
whether  a chemical  reaction  is favourable.  It also shows how AH and AS
may vary with temperature.  Keep in mind that a favourable  reaction  may
be fast or slow. Thermodynamics  makes  no prediction  about the rate of a
reaction,  only whether  or not it can take place. Also, before any reaction
begins,  the activation  energy  must be supplied.

Note that the entropy  of a system  cannot  increase  forever.  Eventually,
a maximum  state of disorder  is reached.  When  this happens,  the system
appears  to have constant  properties,  even though  changes  are still taking
place at the molecular  level. We say that a chemical  system  is at equilibri-
um when it has constant  observable  properties.  Therefore,  equilibrium
occurs  when a system  has reached  its maximum  entropy.  In the next
section,  you will look more closely  at the reactants  and products  of
chemical  systems  and learn how equilibrium  is measured.

As this system  nears equilibrium,  the rate of the forward  reaction  decreases

Dinitrogen  tetroxide  gas is produced  by vaporizing  dinitrogen
tetroxide  liquid. Dinitrogen  tetroxide  liquid  boils at 21°C. If a small

with dinitrogen  tetroxide  gas.
Suppose  that the initial concentration  of N2O4i) is 0.0200  mol/L.
The initial concentration  of NOz) is zero. The initial rate of the forward
reaction,  k;, is relatively  large, while the initial rate of the reverse
reaction,  k,, is zero. The initial conditions  correspond  to the first
exchange  in the ExpressLab  on page 325, where the reactant  cylinder  was
full and the product  cylinder  was empty.  As the reaction  proceeds,  the
rate of the forward  reaction  decreases  because  the concentration  of N2Ox4(g)
decreases.  At the same time, the rate of the reverse  reaction  increases
because  the concentration  of NO) increases.  At equilibrium,  kr = k,.
There are no further  changes  in the relative  amounts  of N2O, and NO;.
The Equilibrium  Constant
From other experiments  involving  the reaction  between  nitrogen
tetroxide  and nitrogen  dioxide,  chemists  know that both the forward
and reverse  reactions  involve  elementary  steps. Thus, you can write rate
equations  for the reactions.
Forward  reaction:  N2O4(g) > 2NOx

You can write rate equations  for these reactions  because  they are

similar  results  are found for any reaction,  regardless  of the mechanism.
For any general  equilibrium  equation,  let P, Q, R, and S represent

This equilibrium  expression  depends  only on the stoichiometry  of the

The Equilibrium  Constant  and Temperature
Adding  a chemical  that is involved  in a reaction  at equilibrium  increases
the rate at which  this chemical  reacts. The rate, however,  decreases  as the
concentration  of the added chemical  decreases.  Eventually,  equilibrium
is re-established  with the same equilibrium  constant.  For a given system
at equilibrium,  the value of the equilibrium  constant  depends  only on
temperature.  Changing  the temperature  of a reacting  mixture  changes  the
rate of the forward  and reverse  reactions  by different  amounts,  because
the forward  and reverse  reactions  have different  activation  energies.  A
reacting  mixture  at one temperature  has an equilibrium  constant  whose
value changes  if the mixture  is allowed  to reach equilibrium  at a different
temperature.
The numerical  value of the equilibrium  constant  does not depend
on whether  the starting  point involves  reactants  or products.  These
are just labels that chemists  use to identify  particular  chemicals  in the
reaction  mixture.  Also, at a given temperature,  the value of K, does not
depend  on the starting  concentrations.  The reaction  gives the same ratio
of products  and reactants  according  to the equilibrium  law. Remember,
however,  that K, is calculated  using concentration  values  when the
system  is at equilibrium.

Measuring  Equilibrium  Concentrations
The equilibrium  constant,  K,, is calculated  by substituting  equilibrium
concentrations  into the equilibrium  expression.  Experimentally,  this
means  that a reaction  mixture  must come to equilibrium.  Then one or
more properties  are measured.  The properties  that are measured  depend
on the reaction.  Common  examples  for gaseous  reactions  include  colour,
pH, and pressure.  From these measurements,  the concentrations  of the
reacting substances  can be determined.  Thus, you do not need to measure
all the concentrations  in the mixture at equilibrium,  You can determine CONCEPT  CHECK

the net ionic equation  is

Because  the reaction  involves  a colour  change,  you can determine  the
concentration  of Fe(SCN)**(aq)  by measuring  the intensity  of the colour.
You will find out how to do this in Investigation  7-A. For now, assume
that it can be done. From the measurements  of colour  intensity,  you
can calculate  the equilibrium  concentration  of Fe(SCN)**(aq).  Then,
knowing  the initial concentration  of each solution,  you can calculate
the equilibrium  concentration  of each ion using the chemical  equation.
Suppose,  for instance,  that the initial concentration  of Fe**(aq) is
0.0064  mol/L and the initial concentration  of SCN (aq) is 0.0010  mol/L.
When the solutions  are mixed,  the red complex  ion forms. By measuring
the intensity  of its colour,  you can determine  that the concentration  of
Fe(SCN)**(aq)  is 4.5 x 10 mol/L. From the stoichiometry  of the equation,
each mole of Fe(SCN)*(aq)  forms when equal amounts  of Fe*'(aq) and
SCN (aq) react. So, if there is 4.5 x 10 mol/L of Fe(SCN)**(aq)  at
equilibrium,  then the same amounts  of both Fe**(qq) and SCN (aq) must
have reacted.  This represents  the change  in their concentrations.  The
equilibrium  concentration  of a reacting  species  is the sum of its initial
concentration  and the change  that results  from the reaction.  Therefore,
the concentration  of Fe**(aq) at equilibrium  is (0.0064  — 0.000 45) mol/L =
0.005 95 mol/L, or 0.0060  mol/L.  You can calculate  the equilibrium
concentration  of SCN (aq) the same way, and complete  the table below.

concentrations  into the equilibrium  expression.

Measuring  an

The colour  intensity  of a solution  is related  to the
concentration  of the ions and the depth of the
solution.  By adjusting  the depth of a solution
with unknown  concentration  until it has the
same intensity  as a solution  with known  concen-
tration,  you can determine  the concentration
of the unknown  solution.  For example,  if the
concentration  of a solution  is lower than the
standard,  the depth of the solution  has to be
greater  in order to have the same colour  intensity.
Thus, the ratio of the concentrations  of two solu-
tions with the same colour  intensity  is inversely
proportional  to the ratio of their depths.

to avoid fractional  values of x

The Sample  Problems  that follow  all involve  homogeneous  equilibrium
systems.  Each problem  illustrates  a particular  type of system  and includes
brief tips. Each problem  also includes  a table like the one on page 339 to
organize  the data. Because  this table is used to record  the initial, change,
and equilibrium  values of the reacting  species,  it is often called an ICE
table. In Chapters  8 and 9, you will use ICE tables again to help you solve
problems  that involve  heterogeneous  equilibrium  systems.

Qualitatively  Interpreting  the Equilibrium  Constant
The Sample  Problem  on page 344 showed  how to calculate  the amounts  of
gases at equilibrium  for the following  reaction.
CO) + H20¢) = Ho¢g) + CO2(g)
Recall  that the equilibrium  constant  for this reaction  was 8.3 at 700 K.
1.0 mol of COy) and 1.0 mol of HzO) were put in a 5.0 L container.  At
equilibrium,  0.48 mol of Hag) and 0.48 mol of COg,) were present.  The
starting  amounts  were in stoichiometric  ratios. Consequently,  if the reac-
tion had gone to completion,  there would  have been no limiting  reactant.
You would  have expected  1.0 mol of both Hag) and COzg). Thus, you can
calculate  the percent  yield of the reaction  as follows:
Equilibrium  [H,] x 100%
Maximum  [Hz]
_ 0.48 x 100%
7 1.0
= 48%
This value indicates  the extent  of the reaction.  It is linked  to the size of
K,. As you know, the equilibrium  expression  is always  written  with the
product  terms over the reactant  terms. Therefore,  a large K, means that the
concentration  of products  is larger than the concentration  of reactants  at
equilibrium.  When referring  to a reaction  with a large K,, chemists  often
say that the position  of equilibrium  lies to the right, or that it favours  the
products.  Similarly,  if K, is small, the concentration  of reactants  is larger
than the concentration  of products.  Chemists  say that the position  of
equilibrium  lies to the left, or that it favours  reactants.  Thus, the
following  general  statements  are true:Percent  yield =
e When K > 1, products  are favoured.  The equilibrium  lies far to the right.
Reactions  where  K is greater  than 101° are usually  regarded  as going to
completion.
e When K = 1, there are approximately  equal concentrations  of reactants
and products  at equilibrium.
e When  K < 1, reactants  are favoured.  The equilibrium  lies far to the left.
Reactions  in which K is smaller  than 107'° are usually  regarded  as not
taking place at all.
Notice  that the subscript  “c” has been left off K in these general  state-
ments. This reflects  the fact that there are other equilibrium  constants
that these statements  apply to, not just equilibrium  constants  involving
concentrations.  You will learn about other types of equilibrium  constants
in the next two chapters.  For the rest of this chapter,  though,  you will
continue  to see the subscript  “c” used.
348 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
In the Sample  Problem  and Practice  Problems  below,  you will
consider  how temperature  affects the extent of a reaction.  Keep in mind
that the size of K, is not related  to the time that a reaction  takes to achieve
equilibrium.  Very large values of K, may be associated  with reactions
that take place extremely  slowly.  The time that a reaction  takes to reach
equilibrium  depends  on the rate of the reaction.  This is determined  by
the size of the activation  energy.

Phosgene  is a product  in the chemical  equation.  A greater  concentration
of product  corresponds  to a larger value of Keg.

The value of K, is larger at 370 K. The position  of equilibrium  lies far
to the right. It favours  the formation  of COC], at the lower temperature.
Check  Your Solution
The problem  asked you to choose  the temperature  for a larger concentra-
tion of the product.  K, is expressed  as a fraction  with product  terms in
the numerator.  Therefore,  the larger value of K, corresponds  to the larger
concentration  of product.

The Meaning  of a Small Equilibrium  Constant
Understanding  the meaning  of a small equilibrium  constant  can
sometimes  help to simplify  a calculation  that would otherwise  involve
a quadratic  equation.  When  K, is small compared  with the initial concen-
tration,  the value of the initial concentration  minus  x is approximately
equal to the initial concentration.  Thus, you can ignore  x. Of course,  if the
initial concentration  of a substance  is zero, any equilibrium  concentration
of the substance,  no matter  how small, is significant.  In general,  values
of K, are not measured  with accuracy  better than 5%. Therefore,  making
the approximation  is justified  if the calculation  error you introduce  is
less than 5%.
To help you decide  whether  or not the approximation  is justified,
divide  the initial concentration  by the value of K,. If the answer  is greater
than 500, the approximation  is justified.  If the answer  is between  100 and
500, it may be justified.  If the answer  is less than 100, it is not justified.
The equilibrium  expression  must be solved  in full.

that the equilibrium  system  would  have, the expression  is given a

expression  that is identical  to the equilibrium  constant  expression,  but
its value is calculated  using concentrations  that are not necessarily

You can calculate  a value for Q, by substituting  the concentration  of each
substance  into this expression.  If the value of Q, is equal to K,, the system
must be at equilibrium.  If Q, is greater  than K,, the numerator  must be
very large. The concentrations  of the chemicals  on the right side of the
equation  must be more than their concentrations  at equilibrium.  In this
situation,  the system  attains equilibrium  by moving  to the left. Conversely,
if Q, is less than K,, the system  attains equilibrium  by moving  to the

Ammonia  is one of the world’s  most important  chemicals,  in terms of the
quantity  manufactured.  Some ammonia  is processed  into nitric acid and
various  polymers.  Roughly  80% of ammonia  is used to make fertilizers,
such as ammonium  nitrate.  In the Haber process  for manufacturing
ammonia,  nitrogen  and hydrogen  combine  in the presence  of a catalyst.

At 500°C, the value of K, for this reaction  is 0.40. The following  concen-
trations  of gases are present  in a container  at 500°C: [Nz] = 0.10 mol/L,
[Ho] = 0.30 mol/L,  and [NHa(g)|  = 0.20 mol/L. Is this mixture  of gases
at equilibrium?  If not, in which  direction  will the reaction  go to reach
equilibrium?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate  Q, and interpret  its value.
What Is Given?
You have the balanced  chemical  equation.  You know that the value of K,
is 0.40. You also know the concentrations  of the gases: [N2] = 0.10 mol/L,
[H2| = 0.30 mol/L,  and [NH3] = 0.20 mol/L.
Plan Your Strategy
Write the expression  for Q., and then calculate  its value. Compare
the value of Q, with the value of K,. Decide  whether  the system  is at

exponents  are common.)  The value of K, is less than one, so you would
expect  the numerator  to be less than the denominator.  This is difficult  to
evaluate  without  a calculator,  however,  because  of the powers.

Le Chatelier’s  Principle
What happens  to a system  at equilibrium  if the concentration  of one of the
reacting  chemicals  is changed?  This question  has practical  importance,
because  many manufacturing  processes  are continual.  Products  are
removed  and more reactants  are added  without  stopping  the process.  For
example,  consider  the Haber process  that was mentioned  in the previous
Sample  Problem.
Now) + 32%) = 2NH3¢)

At 500°C,  K, is 0.40. The gases have the following  concentrations:
[N,] = 0.10 mol/L, [H,] = 0.10 mol/L,  and [NH3] = 0.0063  mol/L. (You
can check  this by calculating  Q, and making  sure that it is equal to K,.)
Ammonia  can be removed  from the equilibrium  mixture  by cooling
because  ammonia  liquefies  at a higher  temperature  than either nitrogen
or hydrogen.  What happens  to an equilibrium  mixture  if some ammonia
is removed?  To find out, you need to calculate  Q..
Q. = [NH3]?
* [No [H2]?
If ammonia  is removed  from the equilibrium  mixture,  the numerator  will
decrease,  so Q, will be smaller  than K,. When Q, < K,, the system  attains
equilibrium  by moving  to the right. Why? The system  must respond  to
the removal  of ammonia  by forming  more ammonia.  Similarly,  if nitrogen,
hydrogen,  or both were added,  the system  would  re-establish  equilibrium
by shifting  to the right. As long as the temperature  remains  constant,
the re-established  equilibrium  will have the same K, as the original
equilibrium.
A French  chemist,  Henri Le Chatelier,  experimented  with various
chemical  equilibrium  systems.  (See Figure 7.9.) In 1888, Le Chatelier
summarized  his work on changes  to equilibrium  systems  in a general
statement  called Le Chatelier’s  principle.  It may be stated as follows:
A dynamic  equilibrium  tends to respond  so as to relieve  the effect of any
change  in the conditions  that affect the equilibrium.
Le Chatelier’s  principle  predicts  the way that an equilibrium  system
responds  to change.  For example,  when the concentration  of a substance
in a reaction  mixture  is changed,  Le Chatelier’s  principle  qualitatively
predicts  what you can show quantitatively  by evaluating  the reaction  quo-
tient. If products  are removed  from an equilibrium  system,  more products
must be formed  to relieve  the change.  This is just as you would  predict,
because  Q, will be less than K,.
Le Chatelier’s  principle  also predicts  what will happen  when other
changes  are made to an equilibrium  system.  For example,  you can use Le
Chatelier’s  principle  to predict  the effects of changing  the volume  of a
cylinder  that contains  a mixture  of gases, or the effects  of changing  the
temperature  of an equilibrium  system.  In the next investigation,  you will
use Le Chatelier’s  principle  to predict  the effects of making  various
changes  to different  equilibrium  systems.  The Chemistry  Bulletin  that
follows  the investigation  considers  applications  of Le Chatelier’s  principle
to areas outside  of chemistry.  Afterward,  you will continue  your studies  of
Le Chatelier’s  principle  and equilibrium  systems  in chemistry.-

In this investigation,  you will use Le Chatelier’s
principle  to predict  the effect of changing  one
factor in each system  at equilibrium.  Then you
will test your prediction  using a colour  change
or the appearance  (or disappearance)  of a

equilibrium?
Predictions
Your teacher  will give you a table that lists four
equilibrium  systems  and the changes  you will
make to each system.  In the appropriate  column,
record  your predictions  for each test. If you
predict  that the change  will cause the system
to re-attain  equilibrium  by shifting  toward  the

Le Chatelier’s  Principle:
Beyond  Chemistry
How is Le Chatelier's  principle  related  to predator-prey
interactions  in ecosystems?
Le Chatelier’s  principle  is a general  statement
about how any system  in equilibrium—not
just a chemical  system—responds  to change.
Le Chatelier  principle  concerns  the conservation
of energy  or matter.  There are corresponding
laws in several  other areas of science.
Heinrich  Lenz studied  the direction  of the
current  that is induced  in a conductor  as a result
of changing  the magnetic  field near it. You can think
of this as the change  in a system  in electromagnetic
equilibrium.  Lenz published  his law in 1834. It states
that when a conductor  interacts  with a magnetic
field, there must be an induced  current  that
opposes  the interaction,  because  of the law of con-
servation  of energy.  Lenz's law is used to explain
the direction  of the induced  current  in generators,
transformers,  inductors,  and many other systems.
In geology,  John Pratt and George  Airy
introduced  the idea of isostacy  in 1855. Earth’s
crust is in gravitational  equilibrium  in almost
all places.  The crust responds  to changes  in the
load on it, however,  by slowly  moving  vertically.
Examples  of how the load on Earth's  crust can
change  include  the weathering  of mountain  ranges
and the melting  of ice caps. Geologists  estimate
362 MHR  = Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibriumthat the ice over parts of Scandinavia  and northern
Europe  was well over 2 km thick during  the last ice
age. As a result of the ice melting  and the removal
of the weight  pushing  down on Earth’s  crust, the
central part of Scandinavia  has risen over 500 m.
This uplift is continuing.  Here gravitational
potential  energy  is being conserved.
In ecology,  ecosystems  are really examples
of steady  state systems.  Ecosystems  involve  a
flow of energy  in only one direction,  from the Sun.
Nevertheless,  populations  of plants and animals
develop  stable numbers  that react to external
changes,  such as disease  and variations  in the
weather.  For example,  if the number  of carnivores
in an ecosystem  increases,  more herbivores  are
eaten and the herbivore  population  decreases.
The carnivores  then have difficulty  finding  food.
Their  populations  decrease  due to competition,
emigration,  and starvation  until a new balance,
however  delicate,  is attained.
Le Chatelier’s  principle  also applies  to biology.
Homeostasis  is the tendency  of a body system
to remain in a state of equilibrium.  Examples  of
homeostasis  include  the maintenance  of body
temperature  (homeothermy)  and the pH balance
of blood.
In economics,  the law of supply  and demand
is similar  to Le Chatelier’s  principle.  When the price
of a commodity,  such as the price of a kilogram  of
apples,  is constant,  the market  for the commodity
is at equilibrium.  If the supply  of the commodity
falls, the equilibrium  is changed.  The market
adjusts  by increasing  the price, which tends to
increase  the supply.
Making  Connections
1. Identify  and describe  two other examples,
in science  or other fields, that illustrate
Le Chatelier’s  principle.
2. Draw diagrams  to show the above examples
of Le Chatelier’s  principle  in human  physiology,
ecology,  and economics.  Show how different
conditions  affect the equilibrium  and how the
systems  react to establish  a new equilibrium.
The Effect of lons on Aqueous  Equilibrium  Systems
Many important  equilibrium  systems  involve  ions in aqueous  solution.
The common  ion effect applies  Le Chatelier’s  principle  to ions in aqueous
solution.  As its name suggests,  the common  ion effect involves  adding
an ion to a solution  in which  the ion is already  present  in solution.  It is
really a concentration  effect. The equilibrium  shifts away from the added
ion, as predicted  by Le Chatelier’s  principle.
An aqueous  solution  that contains  certain  ions can be added  to
another  solution  to form a precipitate,  if the ions have low solubility.
For example,  adding  silver nitrate solution  to test for Cl (aq is effective
due to the very low solubility  of silver chloride.  You can use the precipi-
tation of an insoluble  salt to remove  almost  all of a particular  ion from
a solution  and, as a result, cause a shift in the position  of equilibrium
of the original  solution.  The common  ion effect is important  in the
solubility  of salts. The precipitation  of insoluble  salts is used to identify
the presence  of unknown  ions. You will learn more about the common
ion effect in Chapter  9.
The Effect of Temperature  Changes  on the Position  of Equilibrium
As you know, the value of the equilibrium  constant  changes  with tempera-
ture, because  the rates of the forward  and reverse  reactions  are affected.
Le Chatelier’s  principle  still holds, however.  It can be used to predict  the
effect of temperature  changes  on a system  when the sign of the enthalpy
change  for the reaction  is known.  For example,  the dissociation  of sulfur
trioxide  is endothermic.
2S03(g) = 250) + Oxy) AH = 197 kJ
As the reaction  proceeds  from left to right, energy  is absorbed  by the
chemical  system  and converted  to chemical  potential  energy.  If an
equilibrium  mixture  of these gases is heated,  energy  is added to the
system.  Le Chatelier’s  principle  predicts  a shift that will relieve  the
imposed  change.  Therefore,  the shift will tend to remove  the added
energy.  This will happen  if the equilibrium  shifts to the right, increasing
the amount  of SOg) and Oxi) formed.  As a result, the value of K, will
increase. The shift in equilibrium  is consistent  (as it must be) with the |
law of conservation  of energy.
Suppose  that the equilibrium  of an endothermic  reaction  shifted Chickens  have no sweat

shift still more to the left, releasing  more and more energy. Clearly,  this tration of carbonate  ions in

2S03(g)  = 28 021g) ar OaXg)The Effects  of Volume  and Pressure  Changes  on Equilibrium
When  the volume  of a mixture  of gases decreases,  the pressure  of the
gases must increase.  Le Chatelier’s  principle  predicts  a shift in equili-
brium  to relieve  this change.  Therefore,  the shift must tend to reduce  the
pressure  of the gases. Molecules  striking  the walls of a container  cause
gas pressure,  so a reduction  in gas pressure  at constant  temperature  must
mean fewer gas molecules.  Consider  the following  reaction  again.
25036)  = 2502)  + Or)
There are two gas molecules  on the left side of the equation.
There are three gas molecules  on the right side. Consequently,
if the equilibrium  shifts to the left, the pressure  of the mix-

If the container  expands  when an inert gas is added,  the

decreasing  the pressure  of the reacting  gases.
The Effect of a Catalyst  on Equilibrium
A catalyst  speeds  up the rate of a reaction,  either by allowing  a
different  reaction  mechanism  or by providing  additional  mechanisms.
The overall  effect is to lower  the activation  energy,  which  increases  the
rate of reaction.  The activation  energy  is lowered  the same amount  for
the forward  and reverse  reactions,  however.  There is the same increase
in reaction  rates for both reactions.  As a result, a catalyst  does not affect
the position  of equilibrium.  It only affects  the time that is taken to achieve
equilibrium.
Table 7.2 summarizes  the effect of a catalyst,  and other effects of
changing  conditions,  on a system  at equilibrium.  The Sample  Problem
that follows  provides  an opportunity  for you to use Le Chatelier’s
principle  to predict  the equilibrium  shift in response  to various

In which direction  does the equilibrium  shift as a result of each change?
(a) adding  phosphorus  pentachloride  gas

What Is Required?
You need to determine  whether  each change  causes  the equilibrium  to
shift to the left or the right, or whether  it has no effect.
What Is Given?
You have the balanced  chemical  equation.  You know that the enthalpy

\
Chapter  7 Reversible  Reactions  and Chemical  Equilibrium  * MHR 365
Plan Your Strategy
Identify  the change.  Then use the chemical  equation  to determine  the
shift in equilibrium  that will minimize  the change.
Act on Your Strategy
(a) [PCl;] increases.  Therefore,  the equilibrium  must shift to minimize
[PCl;]. The reaction  shifts to the right.
(b) [Clz] is reduced.  Therefore,  the equilibrium  must shift to increase
[Cl]. The reaction  shifts to the right.
(c) The temperature  decreases.  Therefore,  the equilibrium  must shift in
the direction  in which the reaction  is exothermic.  From left to right,
the reaction  is endothermic.  Thus, the reaction  must be exothermic
from right to left. The reaction  shifts to the left if the temperature  is
decreased.
(d) Helium  does not react with any of the gases in the mixture.
The position  of equilibrium  does not change.
(e) A catalyst  has no effect on the position  of equilibrium.
Check Your Solution
Check the changes.  Any change  that affects the equilibrium  reaction
must result in a shift that minimizes  it.

Applying  Le Chatelier's  Principle:  Manufacturing  Ammonia
Industrial  processes  must be run at optimal  conditions  to be economic.
This means  more than simply  manipulating  the reaction  conditions  to
maximize  the extent  of the reaction.  Business  people,  and the profession-
als they hire to advise  them, must consider  other factors  as well. These
factors  include  the rate of the reaction,  safety, the location  of the plant, the
cost to build and operate  the plant, the cost of acquiring  reactant  materi-
als, the cost of transporting  products,  and the cost of hiring,  educating,
and maintaining  plant workers.
The chapter  introduction  mentioned  the importance  of nitrogen  to
plants and animals.  Despite  nitrogen’s  abundance  in the atmosphere,  its
low reactivity  means  that there is a limited  supply  in a form that organ-
isms can use. In nature,  bacteria  and the energy  of lightning  supply  the
nitrates  and other nitrogen  compounds  that plants need to survive.
Humans  use technology  to produce  these compounds  for our extensive
agricultural  industry.
In this chapter,  you learned  about the Haber process  for manufactur-
ing ammonia.  You used this process  to help you understand  various
concepts  related  to equilibrium.  As you can see in Figure 7.11, ammonia
is a valuable  industrial  chemical.  Its annual  global production  is well over
100 million  tonnes.  The vast majority  of ammonia,  roughly  80%, is used
to make fertilizers.  You will now examine  how the equilibrium  concepts
you have been studying  work together  to provide  society  with  a reliable,
cost-effective  supply  of ammonia.
Before  World  War I, the main source  of nitrates  for human  use was
from large deposits  of bird droppings  in Peru and sodium  nitrate  from
Chile. These sources  were becoming  scarce and expensive.  Then Fritz
Haber (1868-1934),  a lecturer  in a technical  college  in Germany,  began
to experiment  with ways to manufacture  ammonia.  Haber  knew thatUnit Issue Prep

Because  ammonia  is used to manufacture  many essential  products,  it is one of
the top five industrial  chemicals  in the world.
compounds.  What he needed  was a method  for producing  large quantities
of ammonia  at minimal  cost.
Haber experimented  with the direct synthesis  of ammonia.
Na) + 3 Ho(g) = 2NH3(g) AH’* = -92 kJ/mol
Because  the reaction  is exothermic,  heat is released  as the reaction
proceeds.  Le Chatelier’s  principle  predicts  that the yield of ammonia
is greater  at lower temperatures.  Just as in the contact  process  for manu-
facturing  sulfuric  acid, however,  high yield is not the only important
factor. The rate of reaction  for ammonia  synthesis  is too slow at low
temperatures.
Le Chatelier’s  principle  also predicts  that the yield of ammonia  is
greater  at higher  pressures.  High-pressure  plants are expensive  to build
and maintain,  however.  In fact, the first industrial  plant that manufactured
ammonia  had its reaction  vessel  blow up. A German  chemical  engineer,
Carl Bosch,  solved  this problem  by designing  a double-walled  steel vessel
that could operate  at several  hundred  times atmospheric  pressure.  Modern
plants operate  at pressures  in the range of 20 200 kPa to 30 400 kPa.
The gas mixture  is kept pressurized  in a condenser.  (See Figure 7.12.)
Ammonia  is removed  from the reaction  vessel  by cooling  the gas mixture.
Because  of the hydrogen  bonding  between  ammonia  molecules,  the gas
condenses  into a liquid  while the nitrogen  and hydrogen  remain  as gases.
Nitrogen  is removed  to shift the equilibrium  toward  the production  of
more ammonia.  Once the ammonia  is removed,  the gases are recycled
back to the reaction  vessel in a continuous  operation.

This diagram  shows  the stages  in the Haber-Bosch  process  for manufacturing
ammonia.  The catalyst  is a mixture  of MgO, Al,03, and Si02, with embedded  iron crystals.
By manipulating  the pressure  and removing  ammonia  from the reaction
vessel,  Haber successfully  increased  the yield of ammonia.  To increase  the
rate of the reaction,  Haber  needed  to find a catalyst.  A catalyst  would
allow the reaction  to proceed  at higher  temperatures—a  compromise
between  rate and yield. Some historians  claim that Haber performed  more
than 6500 experiments  trying to find a suitable  catalyst.  He finally  chose
an iron catalyst.  This catalyst  works well at the relatively  moderate
temperature  of 400°C that is used for the reaction.  It lasts about five years
before losing its effectiveness.
Haber  received  the Nobel prize for Chemistry  in 1918. Bosch  received
a Nobel prize in 1931 for his work on high pressure  reactions.  Today  the
Haber-Bosch  process  is used to manufacture  virtually  all the ammonia
that is produced  in the world. Plants are usually  located  near a source of
natural  gas, which  is used to obtain  the hydrogen  gas.

The other raw material  is air, which  provides  an inexhaustible  supply  of
nitrogen  gas.
Section  Summary
In this section,  you learned  that the expression  for the reaction  quotient
is the same as the expression  for the equilibrium  constant.  The concentra-
tions that are used to solve these expressions  may be different,  however.
When Q, is less than K,, the reaction  proceeds  to form more products.
When Q, is greater  than K,, the reaction  proceeds  to form more reactants.
These changes  continue  until Q, is equal to K,. Le Chatelier’s  principle
describes  this tendency  of a chemical  system  to return  to equilibrium  after
a change  moves  it from equilibrium.  The industrial  process  for manufac-
turing ammonia  illustrates  how chemical  engineers  apply Le Chatelier’s
principle  to provide  the most economical  yield of a valuable  chemical
product.
K, is only one of several  equilibrium  constants  that chemists  use to
describe  chemical  systems.  In the next chapter,  you will learn how
equilibrium  applies  to chemical  systems  that involve  acids and bases.During World War I, Haber
helped  to develop  the technol-
ogy for deploying  phosgene,
chlorine,  and mustard  gas as
weapons  of chemical  warfare.
His wife Clara, also a chemist,
was disgusted  by the use
of science  in war. When her
husband  refused  to stop his
support  of the war effort, she
committed  suicide.

Anesthesiology:
A Career  in Pain Management
Laila Rafik Karwa
Dr. Laila Rafik Karwa is a specialist  in pain. She
prevents  it, manages  it, and alleviates  it. She is
an anesthesiologist.
Anesthesiologists  are medical  doctors  who are
responsible  for inducing  sleep before surgery,  and
for managing  patients’  pain before,  during,  and after
surgery.  Anesthesiologists  are also involved  in
managing  pain in patients  who have severe
illnesses,  or acute or chronic  pain. For example,
Karwa’s  areas of interest  include  pediatric  and
obstetric  anesthesia  and acute pain management.
Anesthesiologists  must have an intimate
knowledge  of the chemical  and physical  properties
of gases. Many anesthetics  are inhaled  and are
delivered  to the bloodstream  by diffusion.  The
speed at which diffusion  occurs between  the lungs,
the blood, and other tissues  of the body depends
on a constant  called the partition  coefficient.  This
constant  is a ratio that describes  the equilibrium
concentrations  of a solute  that is dissolved  in two
separate  phases.  The solute becomes  separated
(partitioned)  between  the two solvents  in such a way
that its concentration  in one is directly  proportional
to its concentration  in the other.
Gases diffuse  from areas of high concentration
to areas of low concentration.  The speed at which
diffusion  occurs  in the body depends  on partition
coefficients.  The faster  the concentration  in the lung
and brain tissues  reaches  the inhaled  concentration
of an anesthetic,  the sooner  a patient  is induced.Dr. Karwa enjoys  the immediate  gratification
that comes  with anesthesiology  and the speed at
which the anesthetics  exact their effects.  “What  | like
most about my job is the ability  to let patients  have
their surgery  being completely  unaware  of it, and to
make them as pain-free  as possible  during  and after
surgery,”  she says. She chose medicine  as a career
because  she was interested  in biology  and because
she wanted  to help other people  with their health
problems,  after witnessing  her father’s  struggles
with rheumatic  heart disease.
Dr. Karwa completed  high school in Bombay,
India, and later studied  medicine  at the University
of Bombay.  After medical  school,  she immigrated
to Canada.  She completed  residency  training  in
anesthesia  at the University  of Toronto  and now
works at St. Joseph’s  Health Science  Centre  as a
staff anesthesiologist.
In Canada,  students  who are interested  in a
career  as an anesthesiologist  must complete  two to
three years of university  before applying  to medical
school.  Many medical  schools  in Canada  require
applicants  to have taken courses  in specific  subjects
in the biological  and physical  sciences,  and to
have some background  in the humanities  or social
sciences.  This education  also helps students  prepare
for the Medical  College  Admissions  Test (MCAT),
which is required  for application  to most medical
schools.  The MCAT  tests an applicant’s  aptitude  for
science,  verbal reasoning,  and writing.  Most medical
school programs  in Canada  are four years long.
Medical  school graduates  who decide  to do
specialty  training  in anesthesiology  must complete
a postgraduate  residency  program,  which usually
takes at least five years.
Making  Career  Connections
1. Although  anesthesiologists  tend to be associated
with surgery,  they also work outside  the confines
of the operating  room. Research  other locations
where  you might  find an anesthesiologist.
2. Anesthetics  are powerful  medications.  What risks
to patients’  health do anesthesiologists  have to
consider  when they administer  anesthetics?
3. Anesthetics  are classified  into three main groups:
general,  regional,  and local. Research  the criteria
for this classification,  and explain  the distinctions.

F. many people, the word “acid” evokes the image of a fuming, highly
corrosive,  dangerous  liquid. This image is fairly accurate  for concentrated
hydrochloric  acid, a strong acid. Most acids, however,  are not as corrosive
as hydrochloric  acid, although  they may still be very hazardous.  For
example,  hydrofluoric  acid can cause deep, slow-healing  tissue burns if
it is handled  carelessly.  It is used by artists and artisans  who etch glass. It
reacts with the silica in glass to form a compound  that dissolves,  leaving
the glass with a brilliant  surface.  Hydrofluoric  acid is highly  corrosive.
Even a 1% solution  is considered  to be hazardous.  Yet chemists  classify
hydrofluoric  acid as a weak acid.
You learned  about acids and bases in your previous  chemistry  course.
In this chapter,  you will extend  your knowledge  to learn how the struc-
ture of a compound  determines  whether  it is an acid or a base. You will
use the equilibrium  constant  of the reaction  of an acid or base with water
to determine  whether  the acid or base is strong or weak. You will apply
your understanding  of dissociation  and pH to investigate  buffer solutions:
solutions  that resist changes  in pH. Finally,  you will examine  acid-base
titrations  that involve  combinations  of strong and weak acids and bases.

The Arrhenius  Theory  of Acids and Bases
According  to the Arrhenius  theory  (1887),  acids and bases are defined
in terms of their structure  and the ions produced  when they dissolve
in water.
e An acid is a substance  that dissociates  in water to form H*(aq). Two
examples  of Arrhenius  acids are hydrochloric  acid, HCl, and sulfuric
acid, H2SOu,.
e A base is a substance  that dissociates  in water to form OH (aq). Two
examples  of Arrhenius  bases are sodium  hydroxide,  NaOH,  and
potassium  hydroxide,  KOH.
378 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
The Arrhenius  theory  explains  acid-base  reactions  as a combination  of
H"(aq) and OH(qq). It provides  insight  into the heat of neutralization  for
the reaction  between  a strong acid and  a strong  base. (Strong  acids and
bases dissociate  completely  into ions in solution.)  For example,  consider
the following  reaction.
HCliaq) + NaOH aq) > NaCliaq)  + H,0v~) AH =-56 kJ
The total ionic equation  for this reaction  is
(aq) + Cl (aq) + Na‘ (aq) + OH(aq) > Na" (aq) + CI (aq) +H,0j) AH =-56 kJ
Subtracting  spectator  ions from both sides, the net ionic equation  is
FH" (aq) + OH (aq) —> H,Oy~ AH =-56 kJ
Different  combinations  of strong  Arrhenius  acids and bases react with the
same exothermic  result. Measurements  always  show the release  of 56 kJ of
energy  per mole of water formed.  This makes sense, because  the net ionic
equation  is the same regardless  of the specific  neutralization  reaction  that
occurs.
The Arrhenius  theory  has limitations,  however.  For example,  H*(aq),
a bare proton,  does not exist in water. The positive  charge on a proton  is
attracted  to the region  of negative  charge on the lone pair of electrons  on
a water molecule’s  oxygen  atom. The combination  is a hydrated  proton
called a hydronium  ion, H30* (aq).
Haq) + H2,0 (0) > H30" (aq)
The hydronium  ion, itself, forms hydrogen  bonds  with other water
molecules.  (See Figure 8.1.) Thus, a better formula  for the ion that is
present  in acidic solutions  is [H(H,O),]*,  where n is usually  4 or 5. For
convenience,  however,  chemists  usually  use a single hydronium  ion
when writing  equations.

The Arrhenius  theory  also has limitations  for explaining  certain  reactions.
For example,  aqueous  solutions  of ammonia  are basic. They react with
acids in neutralization  reactions,  even though  ammonia  does not contain
the hydroxide  ion. Many aqueous  solutions  of salts with no hydroxide
ions are basic, too. Some reactions  take place without  any liquid solvent.
For example,  ammonium  chloride  can be formed  by the reaction  between
ammonia  and hydrogen  chloride,  which  are both gases:
NH3¢g) + HCl) => NH,Cljs)
Chapter  8 Acids, Bases, and pH* MHR_ 379
The Bronsted-Lowry  Theory
The limitations  of the Arrhenius  theory  of acids and bases are overcome
by a more general  theory,  called the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory.  This theory
was proposed  independently,  in 1923, by Johannes  Brgnsted,  a Danish
chemist,  and Thomas  Lowry,  an English  chemist.  It recognizes  an
acid-base  reaction  as a chemical  equilibrium,  having  both a forward
reaction  and a reverse  reaction  that involve  the transfer  of a proton.  The
Bre@nsted-Lowry  theory  defines  acids and bases as follows:
e An acid is a substance  from which  a proton  can be removed.  (Some
chemists  describe  Brgnsted-Lowry  acids as “proton-donors.”)
e A base is a substance  that can accept  a proton.  (Some chemists  describe
Brensted-Lowry  bases as “proton-acceptors.”)
Note that the word “proton”  refers to the nucleus  of a hydrogen  atom — an
H* ion that has been removed  from the acid molecule.  It does not refer
to a proton  removed  from the nucleus  of another  atom, such as oxygen  or
sulfur,  that may be present  in the acid molecule.  As mentioned  previously,
H* ions share electrons  with any species  (ion or molecule)  that has a lone
pair of electrons.  In aqueous  solution,  the proton  bonds with a water
molecule  to form the hydronium  ion. Unlike  the Arrhenius  theory,
however,  the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory  is not restricted  to aqueous  solutions.
For example,  the lone pair of electrons  on an ammonia  molecule  can bond
with H*, and liquid ammonia  can act as a base.
Definition  Term Arrhenius  Theory Brensted-Lowry  Theory

Conjugate  Acid-Base  Pairs
The dissociation  of acetic acid in water is represented  in Figure 8.2.
This dissociation  is an equilibrium  reaction  because  it proceeds  in both
directions.  Acetic  acid is weak, so only a few ions dissociate.  The position
of equilibrium  lies to the left, and the reverse  reaction  is favoured.  In
the reverse  reaction,  the hydronium  ion gives up a proton  to the acetate
ion. Thus, these ions are an acid and a base, respectively,  as shown  in
Figure 8.3. The acid on the left (CH3;COOH)  and the base on the right
(CH;COO_)  differ by one proton.  They are called a conjugate  acid-base
pair. Similarly,  H,0 and H3;0” are a conjugate  acid-base  pair.

Aqueous  ammonia  is a weak base, so relatively  few hydroxide  ions form.
The position  of equilibrium  lies to the left. In the forward  reaction,  the
water molecule  gives up a proton  and acts as an acid. A substance  that
can act as a proton  donor (an acid) in one reaction  and a proton  acceptor
(a base) in another  reaction  is said to be amphoteric.  (Water  acts as an
acid in the presence  of a stronger  base, and as a base in the presence  of a
stronger  acid.

Molecular  Structure  and the Strength  of Acids and Bases
When  a strong acid or base dissolves  in water, almost  every acid or base
molecule  dissociates.  While there are many acids and bases, most are
weak. Thus, the number  of strong  acids and strong  bases is fairly small.
Strong  Acids
e binary  acids that have the general  formula  HX(aq),  where X = Cl,
Br, and I (but not F): for example,  hydrochloric  acid, HCl, and
hydrobromic  acid, HBr (HCl and HBr are hydrohalic  acids: acids
that have hydrogen  bonded  to atoms of the halogen  elements.)
e oxoacids  (acids containing  oxygen  atoms) in which  the number  of
oxygen  atoms exceeds,  by two or more, the number  of protons  that
can be dissociated:  for example,  nitric acid, HNOs,  sulfuric  acid,
H2SOgz,  perchloric  acid, HClO,,  and chloric  acid, HC1O3
The binary  acids of non-metals  exhibit  periodic  trends  in their acid
strength,  as shown  in Figure 8.5. Two factors  are responsible  for this
trend: the electronegativity  of the atom that is bonded  to hydrogen,
and the strength  of the bond.

The binary  acids
show periodic  trends,  which are
related  to electronegativity  and
bond strength.
Across  a period,  electronegativity  is the most important  factor. The acid
strength  of hydrides  increases  as their electronegativity  increases.  This
happens  because  an electronegative  atom draws electrons  away from the
hydrogen  atom, making  it relatively  positive.  The negative  pole of a water
molecule  then strongly  attracts  the hydrogen  atom and pulls it away.
Down  a group,  bond strength  is the most important  factor. Acid
strength  increases  as bond strength  decreases.  A weaker  bond means  that
the hydrogen  atom is more easily pulled  away from the atom to which  it
is attached.  For example,  hydrofluoric  acid is a stronger  acid than water,
but HF is the weakest  of the hydrohalic  acids because  the H-F bond is
relatively  strong.
Chapter  8 Acids, Bases, and pH* MHR_ 383
You might wonder  how HChaq),
HBriag),  and Hl(aq) can be
described  as increasing  in
strength,  since each acid
dissociates  completely  in
water. This trend becomes
apparent  if you add equal
concentrations  of the acids
to a solvent  that is less basic
than water, such as pure
acetic acid. You will find
that the acids dissociate  to
different  extents.Oxoacids  increase  in strength  with increasing  numbers  of oxygen
atoms,  as shown  in Figure 8.6. The hydrogen  atoms that dissociate
in water are always  attached  to oxygen  atoms. Oxygen  is more
electronegative  than hydrogen,  so oxygen  atoms draw electrons  away from
hydrogen  atoms. The more oxygen  atoms there are in a molecule,  the
greater  is the polarity  of the bond between  each hydrogen  atom and the
oxygen  atom it is attached  to, and the more easily the water molecule  can
tear the hydrogen  atom away.

The relative  strength  of oxoacids  increases  with the number  of oxygen  atoms.
Acids such as HCl, CH;COOH,  and HF are monoprotic  acids. They have
only a single hydrogen  atom that dissociates  in water. Some acids have
more than one hydrogen  atom that dissociates.  These acids are called
polyprotic  acids. For example,  sulfuric  acid has two hydrogen  atoms that
can dissociate.
H2SO0 (aq) + H2,0e) = H30" (aq) + HSOz4 (aq)
HSOg (aq) + H2O( = H3O0%  (aq) + SO4 (aq)
Sulfuric  acid is a far stronger  acid than the hydrogen  sulfate  ion, because
much more energy  is required  to remove  a proton  from a negatively
charged  ion. The strength  ofa polyprotic  acid decreases  as the number  of
hydrogen  atoms that have dissociated  increases.
Strong  bases are confined  to the oxides and hydroxides  from Groups  1
(IA) and 2 (IIA).
Strong  Bases
e all oxides  and hydroxides  of the alkali metals:  for example,  sodium
hydroxide,  NaOH,  and potassium  hydroxide,  KOH
e alkaline  earth (Group 2 (IIA)) metal oxides  and hydroxides  below
beryllium:  for example,  calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH)2,  and barium
hydroxide,  Ba(OH),
The strong  basic oxides  have metal atoms with low electronegativity.
Thus, the bond to oxygen  is ionic and is relatively  easily broken  by the
attraction  of polar water molecules.  The oxide ion always  reacts with
water molecules  to produce  hydroxide  ions.
O* (aq) + H20(e) > 20H (aq)
Magnesium  oxide and magnesium  hydroxide  are not very soluble.  They
are strong  bases, however,  because  the small amount  that does dissolve
dissociates  almost  completely  into ions. Beryllium  oxide is a weak base.
(It is the exception  in Group  2 (IIA).) It is a relatively  small atom, so the
bond to oxygen  is strong and not easily broken  by water molecules.

When  a strong acid dissociates  completely  into ions in water, the
concentration  of H3O0*(aq)  is equal to the concentration  of the strong
acid. Similarly,  when a strong  base dissociates  completely  in water, the
concentration  of OH (aq) is equal to the concentration  of the strong  base.
Calculating  Ion Concentrations  in Acidic  and Basic Solutions
Problem
During  an experiment,  a student  pours 25.0 mL of 1.40 mol/L  nitric
acid into a beaker  that contains  15.0 mL of 2.00 mol/L sodium
hydroxide  solution.  Is the resulting  solution  acidic or basic?  What is the
concentration  of the ion that causes  the solution  to be acidic or basic?
What Is Required?
You must determine  the ion in excess and its concentration.
What Is Given?
You have the following  data:
Volume  of nitric acid = 25.0 mL
[HNO3]  = 1.40 mol/L
Volume  of sodium  hydroxide  = 15.0 mL
[NaOH]  = 2.00 mol/L
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1 Write the chemical  equation  for the reaction.
Step 2 Calculate  the amount  of each reactant  using the following  equation.
Amount  (in mol) = Concentration  (in mol/L)  x Volume  (in L)
Step 3 Determine  the limiting  reactant.
Step 4 The reactant  in excess  is a strong acid or base. Thus, the excess
amount  results  in the same amount  of H;0* or OH’.
Step 5 Calculate  the concentration  of the excess ion by using the amount
in excess and the total volume  of the solution.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 HNOs(aqg)  + NaOH(aqg) > NaNOs(aq)  + H20(0)
Step2 Amount  of HNO3 = 1.40 mol/L x 0.0250  L
= 0.0350  mol
Amount  of NaOH  = 2.00 mol/L x 0.0150  L
= 0.0300  mol
Step 3 The reactants  combine  in a 1:1 ratio. The amount  of NaOHis less,
so this reactant  must be the limiting  reactant.
Step4 Amount  of excess  HNOs(aq)  = 0.0350  mol — 0.0300  mol
= 0.005 0 mol
Therefore,  the amount  of H3O*(aq)  is 5.0 x 107° mol.
Step5 Total volume  of solution  = 25.0 mL + 15.0 mL = 40.0 mL

Section  Summary
Strong  acids and bases (and strong electrolytes)  dissociate  completely  in
water. Therefore,  you can use the concentrations  of these compounds  to
determine  the concentrations  of the ions they form in aqueous  solutions.
You cannot,  however,  use the concentrations  of weak acids, bases, and
electrolytes  in the same way. Their solutions  contain  some particles
that have not dissociated  into ions. Nevertheless,  important  changes  in
[H3;0*] and [OH] take place because  dissolved  ions affect the dissociation
of water.

Weak Acids and Bases
The dissociation  of an acidic or basic compound  in aqueous  solution
produces  ions that interact  with water. The pH of the aqueous  solution  is
determined  by the position  of equilibrium  in reactions  between  the ions
that are present  in solution  and the water molecules.  Pure water contains
a few ions, produced  by the dissociation  of water  molecules:
2H20() = H30" (aq) + OH (aq)
At 25°C, only about two water molecules  in one billion  dissociate.  This
is why pure water is such a poor conductor  of electricity.  In neutral
water, at 25°C, the concentration  of hydronium  ions is the same as the
concentration  of hydroxide  ions: 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L. These concentrations
must be the same because  the dissociation  of water produces  equal num-
bers of hydronium  and hydroxide  ions. Because  this is an equilibrium
reaction,  and because  the position  of equilibrium  of all reactions  changes
with temperature,  [H;0*] is not 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L at other temperatures.
The same is true of [OH].
The lon Product  Constant  for Water
The equilibrium  constant,  K,, for the dissociation  of water is given by the
following  expression.
x. ~ [H:0*OH
° [H,0]?
So few ions form that the concentration  of water is essentially  constant.
The product  K,[H2O]*  is equal to the product  of the concentrations  of
hydronium  ions and hydroxide  ions. The equilibrium  value of the
concentration  ion product  [H;0*][OHTM|  at 25°C is called  the ion product
constant  for water. It is given the symbol  Ky.
K,[H2O]*  = [H30*][OH |
= 1.0 x 10°” mol/L x 1.0 x 107 mol/L
=1.0x 10"
= Ky
The units are commonly  dropped,  as in other equilibrium  expressions  you
have encountered.
The concentration  of H,0* in the solution  of a strong acid is equal
to the concentration  of the dissolved  acid, unless  the solution  is very
dilute. Consider  [H;0*] in a solution  of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric  acid.
All the molecules  of HCl dissociate  in water, forming  a hydronium  ion
concentration  that equals  0.1 mol/L.  The increased  [H30*] pushes  the
dissociation  reaction  between  water  molecules  to the left, in accordance
with Le Chatelier’s  principle.  Consequently,  the concentration  of hydro-
nium ions that results  from the dissociation  of water is even less than
1x 107 mol/L. This [H;0*] is negligible  compared  with the 0.1 mol/L
concentration  of the hydrochloric  acid. Unless  the solution  is very dilute
(about 1 x 10°” mol/L),  the dissociation  of water molecules  can be ignored
when determining  [H;0*] of a strong  acid.
388 =MHR« Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
Similarly,  the concentration  of hydroxide  ions can be determined  from
the concentration  of the dissolved  base. If the solution  is a strong  base,
you can ignore the dissociation  of water molecules  when determining
[OH], unless  the solution  is very dilute. When either [H;0*] or [OHTM] is
known,  you can use the ion product  constant  for water, Ky, to determine
the concentration  of the other ion. Although  the value of K, for water is
1.0 x 10° at 25°C only, you can use this value unless another  value is
given for a different  temperature.
[H,0*] and [OH-] in Aqueous  Solutions  at 25°C
In an acidic solution,  [H30*] is greater  than 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L and
[OH] is less than 1.0 x 10°” mol/L.
In a neutral  solution,  both [H;0°] and [OH] are equal to
1.0 x 10°? mol/L.
In a basic solution,  [H3;O*] is less than 1.0 x 10-7 mol/L and [OH|
is greater  than 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L.

pH and pOH
You can describe  the acidity  of an aqueous  solution  quantitatively  by
stating  the concentration  of the hydronium  ions that are present.  [H30*]
is often, however,  a very small number.  The pH scale was devised  by a
Danish  biochemist  named  Sgren Sgrensen  as a convenient  way to repre-
sent acidity  (and, by extension,  basicity).  The scale is logarithmic,  based
on 10. Think  of the letter p as a mathematical  operation  representing  —log.
The pH of a solution  is the exponential  power  of hydrogen  (or hydroni-
um) ions, in moles per litre. It can therefore  be expressed  as follows:
pH = -log|H307*]
The practical  range of the pH scale, shown  in Figure 8.7, is from 0 to 14.
A solution  of a strong acid that is more concentrated  than 1.0 mol/L
would  give a negative  pH. Since you can determine  [H;0*] of such
solutions  directly  from the concentration  of the acid, the pH scale offers
no advantage.  Similarly,  the pH of a strong  base that is more concentrated
than 1.0 mol/L is greater  than 14. Note that pH is a dimensionless
quantity.  In other words,  it has no units.
You can calculate  the pOH (the power  of hydroxide  ions) of a solution
from the [OH].

you can press the two keys  (v] and [es] in sequence.  (Some calculators
may have a[*] button instead.)  Alternatively,  since [H,0*] = 10?" and
[OH] = 10-P°",  you can enter 10, press the button,  enter the negative
value of pH (or pOH), and then press  [= }.

The Acid Dissociation  Constant
Many common  foods (such as citrus fruits), pharmaceuticals  (such as
AspirinTM),  and some vitamins  (such as niacin,  vitamin  B3) are weak
acids. When a weak acid dissolves  in water, it does not completely  disso-
ciate. The concentration  of the hydronium  ions, and the concentration  of
the conjugate  base of the acid that is formed  in solution,  depend  on the
initial concentration  of the acid and the amount  of acid that dissociates.
You can represent  any weak monoprotic  acid with the general  formula
HA. The equilibrium  of a weak monoprotic  acid in aqueous  solution  can
be expressed  as follows:
HA (aq) + H20 faq) = HsO%(aq)  + A (aq)
The equilibrium  expression  for this reaction  is
[H30*][A7]
[HA ][H20]
In dilute solutions,  the concentration  of water is almost  constant.
Multiplying  both sides of the equilibrium  expression  by [HO] gives
the product  of two constants  on the left side. This new constant  is called
the acid dissociation  constant,  K,. (Some chemists  refer to the acid
dissociation  constant  as the acid ionization  constant.  With either name,
the symbol  is Kg.)K,=

hydroxide  to acetic acid, which is a weak acid. (See Figure 8.8.) By graph-
ing pH against  the volume  of sodium  hydroxide  that you added, you will
be able to calculate  the concentration  of the acetic acid. Then you will be
able to determine  the acid dissociation  constant,  K,, for this acid.

aretiCce:e:§ Acetic acid is a weak monoprotic  acid.Niacin is found in many foods,
including  corn. The niacin
in corn, however,  cannot  be
absorbed  in the intestinal
tract. In regions  of the world
where corn is a major part
of the diet, niacin deficiency
can occur. If you add calcium
oxide or wood ash to the water
in which you boil corn, the
resulting  basic solution  allows
the niacin to be absorbed.  The
flour for making corn tortillas
is commonly  prepared  using
this method.

Analysis
1. Write the chemical  equation  for the

2. Plot a graph of your data, with pH on
the vertical  axis and volume  of NaOH on
the horizontal  axis. Your graph should
showa steep rise in pH as the volume  of
NaOH  becomes  enough  to neutralize  all the
CH;COOH.  Take the midpoint  on the graph
(where  the graph rises steeply)  and read off
the volume  of NaOH.  This is the volume  of
NaOH  that was needed  to neutralize  all the
CH3;COOH.  Compare  the volume  on your
graph with the volume  you recorded  when the
phenolphthalein  indicator  first turned  pink.3. Calculate  the molar concentration  of the
CH3COOH.  Use the ratio in which  the acid
and base react, determined  from the chemical
equation.  You can use the following  equation
to find the amount  of a chemical  in solution.
Amount  (in mol) = Concentration  (in mol/L)
x Volume  (in L)
Determine  the amount  of NaOH added,  using
its concentration  (given  by your teacher)  and
the volume  on your graph (from question  2).
4. Write the expression  for K, for the dissocia-
tion of CH;COOH  in water.
5. Use the initial pH of the CH3;COOH  (before
you added any base) to find the initial [H3;0*].
What was the initial [|CH,;COO |?
6. Assume  that the amount  of CH3;COOH  that
dissociates  is small compared  with the initial
concentration  of the acid. If this is true, the
equilibrium  value of [CH;COOH]  is equal to
the initial concentration  of the acid. Use your
values of [H;0*],  [CH;COOTM]|,  and [CH;COOH]
to calculate  K, for acetic acid. Hint:
[H;0*] = [CH;COO |
7. Refer to the volume  of NaOH on your graph
(from question  2). Calculate  half this volume.
On your graph, find the pH when the solution
was half-neutralized.
8. Calculate  [H;0*] when the CH;COOH  was
half-neutralized.  How does this value com-
pare with your value of K, for CH;COOH?

your value for K, and the accepted  value.
State two sources  of error that might account
for any differences.

pH and Ka of a Weak  Acid
Table 8.2 lists the acid dissociation  constants  for selected  acids at 25°C.
Notice  that weak acids have K, values  that are between  1 and about
1 x 10-1. Very weak acids have K, values that are less than 1 x 1077°.
The smaller  the value of K,, the less the acid ionizes  in aqueous  solution.
Problems  that involve  the concentrations  of ions formed  in aqueous
solutions  are considered  to be equilibrium  problems.  The steps for solving
acid and base equilibrium  problems  are similar  to the steps you learned  in
Chapter  7 for solving  equilibrium  problems.
Solving  Equilibrium  Problems  That Involve  Acids  and Bases
The steps that you will use to solve acid and base equilibrium  prob-
lems will vary depending  on the problem.  Below  are a few general
steps to guide you.
e Write the chemical  equation.  Use the chemical  equation  to set up an
ICE table for the reacting  substances.  Enter any values  that are given
in the problem.  (Note: For the problems  in this textbook,  you can
assume  that the concentrations  of hydronium  ions and hydroxide
ions in pure water are negligible  compared  with the concentrations
of these ions when a weak acid or weak base is dissolved  in water.)
e Let x represent  the change  in concentration  of the substance  with
the smallest  coefficient  in the chemical  equation.
e For problems  that give the initial concentration  of the acid, [HA],
compare  the initial concentration  of the acid with the acid
dissociation  constant,  K,.
[HA]e If >  500, the change  in the initial concentration,  x, is
a
negligible  and can be ignored.
e If Al < 500, the change in the initial concentration,  x, may
a
not be negligible.  The equilibrium  equation  will be more complex,
possibly  requiring  the solution  of a quadratic  equation.

Percent  Dissociation
The percent  dissociation  of a weak acid is the fraction  of acid molecules
that dissociate  compared  with the initial concentration  of the acid,
expressed  as a percent.  (Some chemists  refer to percent  dissociation  as
percent  of dissociation.)  The percent  dissociation  depends  on the value
of K, for the acid, as well as the initial concentration  of the weak acid.
The following  Sample  Problems  show how to solve problems  that involve
percent  dissociation.

Polyprotic  Acids
As you know, polyprotic  acids have more than one hydrogen  atom that
dissociates.  Each dissociation  has a corresponding  acid dissociation
constant.  How can you calculate  the pH of a solution  of a polyprotic  acid?
Problems  that involve  polyprotic  acids can be divided  into as many
sub-problems  as there are hydrogen  atoms that dissociate.  The ion concen-
trations  that are calculated  for the first dissociation  are substituted  as
initial ion concentrations  for the second  dissociation,  and so on. You

[H30*] results  from the first dissociation  of phosphoric  acid, so the
second  dissociation  has a negligible  effect on the concentration  of
hydronium  ions or the pH of the solution.  You would expect  this,
- because  the second  dissociation  is much weaker  than the first.
Polyprotic  Acids and [H30*]
All polyprotic  acids, except sulfuric  acid, are weak. Their second
dissociation  is much weaker  than their first dissociation.  For this reason,
when calculating  [H30*] and pH of a polyprotic  acid, only the first
dissociation  needs to be considered.  The calculation  is then the same as
the calculation  for any weak monoprotic  acid. In the Sample  Problem,
[HPO.2-|  was found to be the same as the second  dissociation  constant,
K,,. The concentration  of the anions  formed  in the second  dissociation
ofa polyprotic  acid is equal to Ka,.
The only common  strong polyprotic  acid is sulfuric  acid.
Nevertheless,  it is strong only for the first dissociation.  Like the second
dissociation  of other polyprotic  acids, the second dissociation  of sulfuric
acid is weak.

Acids and Their Conjugate  Bases
There is an important  relationship  between  the dissociation  constant
for an acid, K,, and the dissociation  constant  for its conjugate  base, Ky.

CH3COOH aq) + H20 (aq) = H3O" (aq) + CH3COO  (ag)
K, is given by the following  expression.
[CH3;COO][H307]
[CH;COOH]
The acetate  ion is the conjugate  base of acetic acid. A soluble  salt of the
conjugate  base, such as sodium  acetate,  forms acetate  ions in solution.
The solution  acts as a base with water.
CH3COO (aq) + H20(aq) = CH3COOH (aq) + OH (aq)
K, is given by the expression  below.
CH;COOH][OH |
[CH3COO |
The product  K,K, gives an interesting  result.
K.Ky = [H;0*|[CH;E00 | x, [CHsCOOH)[OH |
° |[CH;600H] [CH;600 |

= Ky
Thus, for an acid and its conjugate  base (or a base and its conjugate  acid),
KK, = Ky. One interpretation  of the result is the stronger  an acid, the
weaker  its conjugate  base must be. This makes sense chemically,  because
a strong acid gives up a proton  from each molecule.  Therefore,  its conju-
gate base does not bond with the proton.  In summary,  then, the strength
of an acid and its conjugate  base are inversely  related.  The conjugate  of a
strong  acid is always  a weak base, and, conversely,  the conjugate  of a
strong  base is always  a weak acid.K,=

Buffer Solutions
A solution  that contains  a weak acid/conjugate  base mixture  or a weak
base/conjugate  acid mixture  is called a buffer solution.  A buffer solution
resists changes  in pH when a moderate  amount  of an acid or a base is
added to it. (See Figure 8.9.) For example,  adding  10 mL of 1.0 mol/L
hydrochloric  acid to 1 L of water changes  the pH from  7 to about 3, a
difference  of 4 units. Adding  the same amount  of acid to 1 L of buffered
solution  might change  the pH by only 0.1 unit.

addition  of acid addition  of base
Adding  a moderate  amount  of an acid or a base to a buffer solution  causes  little
change  in pH.
Buffer  solutions  can be made in two different  ways:
1. by using a weak acid and one of its salts: for example,  by mixing
acetic acid and sodium  acetate
2. by using a weak base and one of its salts: for example,  by mixing
ammonia  and ammonium  chloride
How does a buffer solution  resist changes  in pH when an acid or a base
is added?  Consider  a buffer solution  that is made using acetic acid and
sodium  acetate.  Acetic  acid is weak, so most of its molecules  are not
dissociated  and [CH;COOH]  is high. Sodium  acetate  is soluble  and a
good electrolyte,  so [CH3;COOTM]  is also high. Adding  an acid or a base has
little effect because  the added  H30* or OH ions are removed  by one of
the components  in the buffer solution.  The equilibrium  of the reactions
between  the ions in solution  shifts, as predicted  by Le ChAatelier’s
principle  and described  below.
e Adding  an acid to a buffer:  Acetate  ions react with the hydronium
ions added  to the solution.
CH3COO (aq) + H30* (aq) = CH3COOH  (aq) + H2O0(e)
The position  of equilibrium  shifts to the right. Here hydronium  ions
are removed,  by acetate  ions, from the sodium  acetate  component.
e Adding  a base to a buffer:  Hydroxide  ions react with the hydronium
ions that are formed  by the dissociation  of acetic acid.
H30* (aq) + OH (aq) = 2H20 2)
The position  of this water equilibrium  shifts to the right, replacing
hydronium  ions.
Buffer solutions  have two important  characteristics.  One of these
characteristics  is the pH of the solution.  The other is its buffer  capacity:
the amount  of acid or base that can be added  before considerable  change
occurs  to the pH. The buffer capacity  depends  on the concentration  of
the acid/conjugate  base (or the base/conjugate  acid) in the buffer solution.
When  the ratio of the concentration  of the buffer components  is close to 1,
the buffer capacity  has reached  its maximum.  As well, a buffer  that is
more concentrated  resists changes  to pH more than than a buffer  that is
more dilute. This idea is illustrated  in Figure 8.10, with buffer solutions
of acetic acid and acetate  of different  concentrations.

terms: acid-base  titration know the volumes  of both solutions  at the equivalence  point, and the con-
curve, equivalence  point centration  of one of them, they can calculate  the unknown  concentration.
As you can see in Figure  8.11, the equivalence  point is the middle  of
the steep rise that occurs  in a titration  curve. The endpoint  of a titration
occurs  when the indicator  changes  colour,  which  happens  over a range
of about 2 pH units. The pH changes  rapidly  near the equivalence  point.
Therefore,  the change  in colour  usually  takes place in a fraction  of a
millilitre,  with the addition  of a single drop of solution.  Chemists  have
access to a variety  of indicators  that change  colour  at different  pH values.
The colour  changes  and ranges  for three common  indicators  are given
in Table 8.4.

phenolphthalein colourless  to pink 8.2-10.0
When an indicator  is used in a titration,  the range of pH values  at which
its endpoint  occurs  must include,  or be close to, the equivalence  point.
Some representative  acid-base  titration  curves,  shown  in Figures  8.11,

The kidneys are sometimes  called the master chemists of the body. They
work to maintain  the constant  composition  of the blood by helping  to bal-
ance water and the various  ions that are present  in the blood. A very
important  equilibrium  in the blood,  which  the kidneys  help to control,
involves  calcium  ions and phosphate  ions.
3Ca**  (aq) + 2PO4* (aq) = Ca3(POx4)a(s)
This equilibrium  sometimes  causes  problems,  however.  For example,
calcium  phosphate  helps to give bones their rigidity.  If the kidneys  remove
too many phosphate  ions from the blood due to disease,  the position  of
equilibrium  shifts to the left, as predicted  by Le Chatelier’s  principle.  More
calcium  phosphate  dissolves  in the blood, reducing  bone density.  The loss
of too much calcium  phosphate  can lead to osteoporosis.
If the kidneys  remove  too many calcium  ions from the blood,  the
equilibrium  position  in the kidneys  shifts to the right. Solid calcium
phosphate  can form in the kidneys,  producing  kidney  stones.  Kidney
stones,  which  are painful,  can also form as the result of calcium  oxalate
precipitating  in the kidneys.  Precipitates  of other compounds  can affect
different  areas of the body: gallstones  in the gall bladder  and gout in
the joints are two examples.
In this chapter,  you will continue  your study of acid-base  reactions.
You will find out how ions in aqueous  solution  can act as acids or bases.
Then, by applying  equilibrium  concepts  to ions in solution,  you will be
able to predict  the solubility  of ionic compounds  in water and the forma-
tion of a precipitate.

The Acid-Base  Properties  of
Salt Solutions
At the end of Chapter  8, you learned  that when just enough  acid and
base have been mixed for a complete  reaction,  the solution  can be acidic,
neutral,  or basic. The reaction  between  an acid and a base forms an
aqueous  solution  of a salt. The properties  of the dissolved  salt determine
the pH of a titration  solution  at equivalence.  Figure  9.1 shows  the acidic,
basic, or neutral  properties  of three salt solutions.
In this section,  you will learn how to predict  the pH of an aqueous
solution  of a salt. Predicting  the pH is useful  when you are performing  a
titration  experiment,  because  you need to choose  an indicator  that
changes  colour  at a pH value that is close to the pH at equivalence.
Acidic and Basic Properties  of Salts
The acidic or basic property  of an aqueous  solution  of a salt results  from
reactions  between  water and the dissociated  ions of the salt. Some ions do
not react with water. They are neutral  in solution.  Ions that do react with
water produce  a solution  with an excess of H3O0*(aq)  or OH (aq). The extent
of the reaction  determines  the pH of the solution.  As you will see, the
reaction  between  an ion and water is really  just another  acid-base  reaction.
Is there a way to classify  salts so that you can predict  whether  their
solutions  in water will be basic, acidic, or neutral?  In the following
ExpressLab,  you will determine  the pH values of solutions  of various
salts. Then you will analyze  your results  to decide  if there is a pattern.9.1

ExpressLab
In this ExpressLab,  you will measure  the pH
values of solutions  of different  salts with the same
concentration  in mol/L. The pH of a solution  gives
the relative  [H30*],  compared  with the [OH]. From
this information,  you can infer which ion in the salt
reacted  with water  to the greatest  extent.

Analysis
1. An ion that does not react with water has no
effect on the pH of water. If both the cation and
the anion in a salt do not react with water, a
solution  of the salt will be neutral.  Which salt
consists  of cations  and anions  that do not react
with water?  How did you classify  this salt in
terms of the strength  of the acid and base used
to form it?
2. If a salt consists  of one ion that does not react
with water, and another  ion that does, the pH of
a solution  of the salt will be affected  by the ion
that reacts with water.
(a) Which salt(s) formed  acidic solutions?
Which ion accounts  for the acidic nature of
the solution?
(b) Which salt(s) formed  basic solutions?
Which ion accounts  for the basic nature  of
the solution?
3. Classify  your unknown  salt in terms of the
strength  of the base and the acid from which
the salt was formed.
Salts That Dissolve  and Form Neutral  Solutions
In the following  equation,  HA(aq) represents  a strong acid, which
dissociates  completely  in water.
HA(ag) + H20( > Hg0% (aq) + A (aq)
Interpreting  the equation  from right to left, the conjugate  base of the
acid, A’, has no tendency  to combine  with hydronium  ions in water.
Therefore,  it is a weak base. In fact, the anion that is formed  by a strong
acid is a much weaker  base than water, so it does not react with water.
Consequently,  when  a salt that contains  the anion of a strong acid is
dissolved  in water, the anion has no effect on the pH of the solution.
420 MHR- Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
For example,  the conjugate  base of hydrochloric  acid, HCl, is Cl. The
chloride  ion is a very weak base, so it does not react significantly  with
water. Therefore,  the chloride  ion, and the conjugate  bases of other strong
acids, do not affect the pH of an aqueous  solution.
Similarly,  the cations  that form strong  bases (the alkali metals  and
the metals  below  beryllium  in Group 2 (IIA)) do not tend to react with
hydroxide  ions. These cations  are weaker  acids than water. Therefore,
when  a salt contains  one of these ions (for example,  Na‘) the cation  has
no effect on the pH of an aqueous  solution.
If a salt contains  the cation of a strong  base and the anion of a strong
acid, neither  ion reacts with water. Therefore,  the solution  has a pH
of 7. Sodium  chloride  is an example  of such  a salt. It is formed  by the
reaction  of sodium  hydroxide  (a strong  base) and hydrochloric  acid
(a strong acid). Salts of strong  bases and strong  acids dissolve  in water
and form neutral  solutions.
Salts That Dissolve  and Form Acidic  Solutions
A weak base, such as aqueous  ammonia,  dissociates  very little. Therefore,
the equilibrium  lies to the left.
NHavaq)  + H,0v) = NH4"  (aq) + OH-
Interpreting  this equation  from right to left, the ammonium  ion,
(which  is the conjugate  acid of aqueous  ammonia)  is a relatively  strong
acid, compared  to water. In solution,  ammonium  ions react with water,
resulting  in an acidic solution:
NH4"  (aq) + H20 ce) = NHavaq)  + H30* (aq)
If a salt consists  of the cation  of a weak base and the anion of a strong
acid, only the cation  reacts with water. The solution  has a pH that is less
than 7. Salts of weak bases and strong  acids dissolve  in water and form
acidic  solutions.
Salts That Dissolve  and Form Basic Solutions
A weak acid, HA, forms a conjugate  base, A’, that is relatively  strong. ud
The reaction  of such an anion with water results  in a solution  that is basic.
For example,  consider  acetic acid, CH;COOH  (aq), a weak acid. The conju-
gate base of acetic acid, CH3COO aq), is relatively  strong,  compared  toA reaction  between  an ion
and water is sometimes  called
water. It reacts with water to form a basic solution. a hydrolysis  reaction.  An

acid, such as NaCH3COO,  only the anion reacts significantly  with water. chloride  ion does not.
The reaction  produces  hydroxide  ions. Therefore,  the solution  will have a S y,
pH that is greater  than 7. Salts of strong  bases and weak acids dissolve  in
water and form basic solutions.
Salts of Weak Bases and Weak Acids
If a salt consists  of the cation  of a weak base and the anion of a weak acid,
both ions react with water. The solution  is weakly  acidic or weakly  basic,
depending  on the relative  strength  of the ions that act as the acid
or the base. You can determine  which  ion is stronger  by comparing  the
values  of K, and K, associated  with the cation  and the anion, respectively.
If K, > Ky, the solution  is acidic. If K, > Ka, the solution  is basic.

Cajo(PO.1)s(OH)2.  Hydroxyapatite  reacts with acids to form solvated  ions
and water. (Solvated  ions are ions surrounded  by solvent  particles.)
Eventually,  a cavity forms in the enamel.
To help prevent  acid from damaging  tooth enamel,  many water treat-
ment plants add small concentrations  (about 1 ppm) of salts, such as NaF,
422 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
to the water. You may notice that a fluoride  salt has also been added to
your toothpaste.  Fluoride  ions displace  OH” from hydroxyapatite  to form
fluoroapatite,  Caio(PO4)sF2,  as shown  in the equation  below.
Cajo(PO4)6(OH)a(s)  + 2F (ag) > Caro(PO.)6F2(s)  + 20H (aq)
The fluoride  ion is a much weaker  base than the hydroxide  ion, and
fluoroapatite  is therefore  less reactive  towards  acids.
The following  Sample  Problem  shows you how to predict  the acidity
or basicity  of aqueous  salt solutions.

Determine  whether  the cation  is from a strong or weak base, and whether
the anion is from a strong or weak acid. Ions derived  from weak bases or
weak acids react with water and affect the pH of the solution.  If both
ions react with water, compare  the equilibrium  constants  (K, and Kj) to
determine  which  reaction  goes farthest  to completion.

Calculating  pH at Equivalence
In an acid-base  titration,  you carefully  measure  the volumes  of acid and
base that react. Then, knowing  the concentration  of either the acid or
the base, and the stoichiometric  relationship  between  them, you calculate
the concentration  of the other reactant.  The equivalence  point in the
titration  occurs  when just enough  acid and base have been mixed  for a
complete  reaction  to occur, with no excess of either reactant.  As you
learned  in Chapter  8, you can find the equivalence  point from a graph that
shows pH versus  volume  of one solution  added to the other solution.  To
determine  the equivalence  point experimentally,  you need to measure  the
pH. Because  pH meters  are expensive,  and the glass electrodes  are fragile,
titrations  are often performed  using an acid-base  indicator.
An acid-base  indicator  is usually  a weak, monoprotic  organic  acid.
The indicator  is in equilibrium  between  the undissociated  acid, which  is
one colour,  and its conjugate  base, which  is a different  colour.
HInaq) + H20¢) = H30*  (aq) + In" (aq)
colour  1 colour  2
For example,  one indicator,  called methyl!  red, is red when the pH is
below  4.2, and yellow  when the pH is above 6.2. The point in a titration
at which  an indicator  changes  colour  is called the end-point.  The colour
change  occurs over a range of about 2 pH units, but the pH of a solution
changes  rapidly  near the equivalence  point. Often a single drop of base
causes  the shift from colour 1 to colour  2. For methyl  red, the end-point
occurs over the pH range 4.2 to 6.2. Therefore,  this indicator  is used when
an acid-base  titration  results  in a moderately  acidic solution  at equiva-
lence. Figure 9.3 shows  the colours  and end-points  of various  indicators.

Thymol  blue and alizarin  are diprotic.  They change  colour  over two different  ranges.
To choose  the appropriate  indicator  for a particular  titration,  you must
know the approximate  pH of the solution  at equivalence.  As you learned
in Chapter  8, an acid-base  titration  curve provides  this information.
What if you do not have  a titration  curve?  You can calculate  the pH at
equivalence  using what you know about salts.
Chapter  9 Aqueous  Solutions  and Solubility  Equilibria»  MHR 425
For example,  suppose  that you are titrating  a strong acid solution
against  a weak base. At the equivalence  point, the flask contains  an
aqueous  solution  of the salt that is formed  by the reaction.  The solution  of
a salt of a weak base and  a strong acid is acidic, so methyl  red may be an
appropriate  indicator.  The pH at equivalence  in a titration  is the same as
the pH of an aqueous  solution  of the salt formed.

2.0 x 10' mL of 0.20 mol/L NHagfaq)  is titrated  against  0.20 mol/L HCl (aq).
Calculate  the pH at equivalence.  Use Figure  9.3 to select an
appropriate  indicator.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate  the pH at equivalence.  As well, you need to
find an indicator  that changes  colour  at a pH that is close to the same
pH at equivalence.
What Is Given?
You know that 20 mL of 0.20 mol/L NHa(aq)  base reacts with 0.20 mol/L

is needed  to react with all the NHa(aq).
Step3 Find the volume  of HCl),  based on the amount  and

Step 4 Calculate  the concentration  of the salt formed,  based on the

which  ion reacts with water. Write the equation  that represents
the reaction.
Step 5 Determine  the equilibrium  constant  for the ion that is involved
in the reaction.  Then divide the [NH,*] by K, to determine
whether  the change  in concentration  of the ammonium  ion can
be ignored.
Step 6 Set up an ICE table for the ion that is involved  in the reaction  with
water. Let x represent  the change  in the concentration  of the ion
that reacts.
Step 7 Write the equilibrium  expression.  Substitute  the equilibrium
concentrations  into the expression,  and solve for x.
Step 8 Use the value of x to determine  the [H;0*].  Then calculate  the pH
of the solution.  Using Figure 9.3, choose  an indicator  that changes
colour  in a range that includes  the pH of the solution.

NHa(aq)  and HCl(aq) react in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore,  4.0 x 10° mol of

The salt forms NH4"(aq)  and Cl (aq) in solution.  NH4*(aq)  is the
conjugate  acid of a weak base, so it reacts with water. Cl  (aq) is
the conjugate  base of a strong acid, so it does not react with water.
The pH of the solution  is therefore  determined  by the extent of the
following  reaction.

In Chapter  7, you learned  that a saturated  solution  containing  undissolved
solute is an example  of a system  at equilibrium.  Recall from your previous
chemistry  course  that the solubility  of a solute is the amount  of solute
that will dissolve  in a given volume  of solvent  at a certain  temperature.
In other words,  the solubility  of a solute indicates  how much of that
solute is present  in a solution  at equilibrium.  Data tables often express
solubility  as (g solute)/(100  mL solvent).  Molar solubility,  on the other
hand, is always  expressed  in terms of (mol solute/L solvent).
The solubility  of ionic solids in water covers a wide range of values.
Knowing  the concentration  of ions in aqueous  solution  is important  in
medicine  and in chemical  analysis.  In this section,  you will continue  to
study equilibrium.  You will examine  the solubility  equilibria  of ionic
compounds  in water.
Solubility  as an Equilibrium  Process
In Chapter  7, you learned  that three factors—change  in enthalpy  (AH),
change  in entropy  (AS), and temperature  (T)—determine  whether  or not a
change  is favoured.  The same three factors  are important  for determining
how much of a salt will dissolve  in a certain  volume  of water. These
factors  are combined  in the following  equation,  where  AG is the change
in free energy  of the system.
AG = AH — TAS
As you know from Chapter  7, a change  is favoured  when AG is negative.
When  a salt dissolves,  the entropy  of the system  always  increases,
because  ions in solution  are more disordered  than ions in a solid crystal.
An increase  in entropy  favours  the formation  of a solution  because  the
term —TAS is negative.  Most solids dissolve  to a greater  extent  at higher
solution  temperatures,  because  the term —TAS becomes  more negative.
Explaining  the overall  enthalpy  change  for a dissolving  salt is more
complicated  because  it involves  a number  of energy  changes.  Cations
must be separated  from anions,  which  requires  energy.  Water molecules
then surround  each ion in solution,  which  releases  energy.  If the overall
enthalpy  change  is negative,  the formation  of a solution  is favoured.  If the
enthalpy  increases,  the formation  of a solution  is not favoured  because  AG
is less negative.
Heterogeneous  Equilibrium:  A Solubility  System
Consider  barium  sulfate,  a sparingly  soluble  salt. X-ray technicians  give
patients  a barium  sulfate  suspension  to drink before taking an X-ray of the
large intestine.  A suspension  of barium  sulfate  is opaque  to X-rays,  which
helps to define this part of the body. (See Figure 9.4.)
When  you add barium  sulfate  crystals  to water,  barium  ions and
sulfate  ions leave the surface  of the solid and enter the solution.  Initially,
the concentration  of these ions is very low. Thus, the forward  change,
dissolving,  occurs at a greater  rate than the reverse  change:
BaSOa(s) = Ba?" (aq) + S047 (aq)
430 MHR-» Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
As more ions enter the solution,  the rate of the reverse  change,
recrystallisation,  increases.  Eventually,  the rate of recrystallisation  becomes
equal to the rate of dissolving.  As you know, when the forward  rate and
the backward  rate of a process  are equal, the system  is at equilibrium.
Because  the reactants  and the products  are in different  phases,  the reaction
is said to have reached  heterogeneous  equilibrium.  For solubility  systems
of sparingly  soluble  ionic compounds,  equilibrium  exists between  the solid
ionic compound  and its dissociated  ions in solution.
The Solubility  Product  Constant
When excess  solid is present  in a saturated  solution,  you can write the
equilibrium  constant  expression  for the dissolution  of the solid in the
same way that you wrote the equilibrium  constant  expression  for a
homogeneous  equilibrium  in Chapter  7. For example,  the equilibrium
constant  expression  for barium  sulfate  is written  as follows:
[Ba** (aq) I[SO4* (aq)!
[BaSOa5)]
The concentration  of a solid, however,  is itself a constant  at a constant
temperature.  Therefore,  you can combine  the term for the concentration
of the solid with the equilibrium  constant  to arrive at a new constant:
K|[BaSOus)]  = [Ba7*,aq][SOx”  (aq)!
Ksp = [Ba**(aq)|  [SO4” (aq)
The new constant  is called the solubility  product  constant,  K,).

You know intuitively  that solubility  depends  on temperature.  For
most ionic compounds,  more solute can dissolve  in a solvent  at higher
temperatures.  Chemists  determine  the solubility  of an ionic compound  by
experiment,  and then use the solubility  data to determine  Kp. Like the
equilibrium  constant,  K,, is temperature-dependent.  Therefore,  different
experiments  must be carried  out to determine  K,, at different  temperatures.

Determining  a Solubility  Product  Constant
In Investigation  9-A, you will collect  solubility  data and use these data to
determine  a K,, for calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH)z.  When you calculate  Ks,,
you assume  that the dissolved  ionic compound  exists as independent
hydrated  ions that do not affect one another.  This assumption  simplifies
the investigation,  but it is not entirely  accurate.  Ions do interfere  with
one another.  As a result, the value of K,, that you calculate  will be just
an approximation.  K,, values  that are calculated  from data obtained
from experiments  such as Investgation  9-A are generally  higher  than the
actual  values.

The Common  Ion Effect
So far, you have considered  solubility  equilibria  for pure substances
dissolved  in water. What happens  to the solubility  of an ionic compound
when it is added to a solution  that already  contains  one of its ions?
Consider  a saturated  solution  of lead(II)  chromate.  See Figure 9.5(A)
on the next page. The following  equation  represents  this equilibrium.
PbCrO.(5)  = Pb** (aq) + CrO4” (aq)
436 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and Equilibrium
A solution  of a salt that contains  chromate  ions, such as sodium
chromate,  NagCrOa(aq),  is added  to the mixture.  More yellow  lead{II)
chromate  precipitates  out of solution,  as shown  in Figure 9.5(B).
As you learned  in Chapter  8, this phenomenon  is called the common
ion effect. The observed  result is predicted  by Le Chatelier’s  principle.
Adding  a common  ion to a solution  increases  the concentration  of that ion
in solution.  As a result, equilibrium  shifts away from the ion. In this
example,  adding  chromate  ions causes  the equilibrium  to shift to the left,
and lead(IJ)  chromate  precipitates.
GETEEEEY  Adding chromate  ions

Analyzing  the expression  for the solubility  product  constant  gives the
same result.
Kgp = [Pb**][CrO,” |
= 2.3 x 10° at 25°C
Since K,, is a constant  at a given temperature,  an increase  in the
concentration  of one ion must be accompanied  by a decrease  in the
concentration  of the other ion, achieved  by the formation  of a precipitate.
This explains  why solid lead(II)  chromate  precipitates  out of solution.
The next Sample  Problem  shows how to predict  the solubility  of an
ionic compound  when a common  ion is present  in solution.

Step 4 Since K,p) is very small, you can assume  that x is much smaller

Therefore,  in the (0.10 + x) term, x can be ignored.  In other words,
(0.10 + x) is approximately  equal to 0.10. Therefore,  you can
simplify  the equation  as follows:
Ksp = [Pb**][CrO47"]  = 2.3 x 107?
= (x)(0.10  + x)
= (x)(0.10)
.(x)(0.10)  = 2.3 x 1078

The molar solubility  of PbCrO,  in a solution  of 0.10 mol/L
NagCrO,  is 2.3 x 10-'* mol/L. Your prediction  was correct.  The
solubility  of PbCrO,  decreases  in a solution  of common  ions.

smaller  than 0.10. To prove that the approximation  works, substitute  the

Dr. Joseph  Maclnnis  has a medical  degree,  but
he does not work in a clinic, a hospital,  or a typical
doctor's  office. His office is the ocean,  and he is an
expert in deep-sea  diving.  He combines  his medical
expertise  with his knowledge  of the properties
of gases to study the effects  of deep-sea  diving
on humans.
Maclnnis  was born in Barrie, Ontario,  in 1937. In
1963, after graduating  from the University  of
Toronto’s  medical  school,  he received  a fellowship
to study diving medicine  at the University  of
Pennsylvania.  Diving medicine  is a specialized  field,
dealing  with the challenges  that humans  face when
exposed  to undersea  environments.
For every 10 m below  sea level that a diver
descends  under  water, ambient  pressure  increases
by one unit of atmospheric  pressure.  This increase  in
pressure,  and its effect on heterogeneous  equilibriain the body, is one of the most profound  challenges
that a diver encounters.  As a diver descends,  and
is subjected  to increased  pressure,  gases such as
nitrogen  dissolve  in the blood and tissues.  In the
equilibrium  between  dissolved  nitrogen  and gaseous
nitrogen,  increased  pressure  favours  dissolved
nitrogen,  according  to Le Chatelier’s  principle.  As the
diver ascends  to the ocean surface  and pressure
decreases,  equilibrium  favours  the nitrogen  coming
out of solution.
If a diver ascends  too quickly,  the lungs cannot
remove  the nitrogen  fast enough.  Gas bubbles  form
in the blood,  causing  decompression  sickness.
Decompression  sickness  is also known as “the
bends,”  because  one of its symptoms  is an inability
to bend the joints.
Maclnnis  was a consultant  to the team that dis-
covered  the Titanic,  and he was the first Canadian  to
explore  the wreck. In 1991, MacInnis  and his team
used small submarines  with pressurized  hulls to film
the wreck in IMAX format.  The wreck is about 4000 m
below  sea level, but the pressure  inside the sub-
marines  was kept similar  to the pressure  above  the
surface  of the sea.
MacInnis  is passionate  about  the environment,
both below and above the sea. Since 1996,
MacInnis  has been Chair of the Friends  of the
Environment  Foundation,  a non-profit  organization
that funds projects  that help to protect  Canada’s
environment.  In recognition  of his accomplishments,
MacInnis  was made a member  of the Order of

How do buffers in human
blood maintain  the blood’s pH?
In the Chemistry  Course
Challenge,  you will learn about
the buffer system  in blood.
How would you design an
investigation  to demonstrate
how the system resists
changes  in pH?Buffers  and the Common  lon Effect
In Chapter  8, you learned  that buffers  resist changes  in pH when acids or
bases are added.  Buffers  have many uses in a chemistry  lab. For example,
commercial  buffers  with certified  pH values  are available.  Chemists  in
analytical  laboratories  use these acidic,  basic, and neutral  buffers  to
ensure  the accuracy  of their pH meters  across the pH range.
Recall,  from Chapter  8, that a buffer consists  of a weak acid/conjugate
base mixture  or a weak base/conjugate  acid mixture.  One buffer  that
you examined  previously  contains  acetic acid and sodium  acetate.  The
common-ion  effect applies  to this buffer. The equilibrium  of the acetic
acid is affected  by the common  acetate  ion from sodium  acetate.
Since buffers  are an example  of the common-ion  effect, the concentra-
tion of ions (hence  the pH) of a buffer solution  can be calculated  using a
method  that is similar  to the method  you used to determine  solubility  in a
common  ion effect problem.  You will use K,, however,  instead  of Ksp.
Also, buffers  are in homogeneous  equilibria,  unlike  saturated  solubility
systems,  which  are in heterogeneous  equilibria.  Therefore,  you need to
consider  the initial concentration  of the reactants.  (The reactants  are not
solids, so their concentration  is not constant.)
pH of a Buffer  and the Common-Ion  Effect

Predicting  the Formation
of a Precipitate
In section  9.2, you worked  with concentrations  of ions in solutions  at
equilibrium.  You used K,, to determine  the solubility  of ionic substances
in pure water and in solutions  of common  ions. The systems  you worked
with were saturated  solutions  that contained  excess,  undissolved  solute.
How do you predict  whether  a given concentration  of ions will result
in the precipitation  of an ionic compound?  How can you tell if a solution
is saturated?  You substitute  the concentrations  of the ions into an expres-
sion that is identical  to the solubility  product  expression.  Because  these
concentrations  may not be the same as the concentrations  that the
equilibrium  system  would  have, however,  the expression  has a different
name: the ion product.
Comparing  the lon Product  With the Solubility  Product
The ion product,  Q,p, is an expression  that is identical  to the solubility
product  constant,  but its value is calculated  using concentrations  that
are not necessarily  those at equilibrium.  (The relationship  between  the
expression  for solubility  product,  K,,, and the expression  for the ion
product,  Qs, is analogous  to the relationship  between  the equilibrium
constant,  K,, and the reaction  quotient,  Q..)
For example,  suppose  that you slowly  add an ionic compound,
such as magnesium  sulfate,  MgSO,,  to water in a beaker.  The following
equation  represents  the dissociation.
MgSO...)  = Mg**(aq)  + SO4? (aq) Kep = 5.9 x 1079
Initially,  all the magnesium  sulfate  dissolves.  The solution  is not at
equilibrium  as long as more solid can dissolve.  As you add more solid,
however,  the solution  reaches  equilibrium.  The solution  is saturated,
and no more salt will dissolve.  If you continue  to add magnesium  sulfate
to the water, you will see an increasing  amount  of solid in the beaker.
The ion product  expression  for magnesium  sulfate  is written
as follows:
Qsp = [Mg?*]  [SO.* |]
You calculate  Q, by substituting  the concentration  of each ion into
the expression.  If Q, is larger than K,, the product  of the concentrations  of
the ions is greater  than it would  be at equilibrium.  For the system  to attain
equilibrium,  some of the ions must leave the solution  by precipitation.
Conversely,  if Q, is less than K,,, the product  of the concentration  of the
ions is smaller  than it is at equilibrium.  Therefore,  the solution  is not yet
saturated  and more ions can be added  to the solution  without  any
precipitation.  The relationship  between  Q, and Kj, for the dissociation  of
a slightly  soluble  ionic compound  is summarized  on the next page. Use the
following  general  equation  as a reference.

Using the lon Product  Expression
You can use the relationship  between  the ion product  expression  and the
solubility  product  expression  to predict  whether  a precipitate  will form
in a given system.  One common  system  involves  mixing  solutions  of two
soluble  ionic compounds,  which  react to form an ionic compound  with a
very low solubility.  If Q, > Kp, based on the initial concentrations  of the
ions in solution,  the sparingly  soluble  compound  will form a precipitate.
How do you know which  ionic compounds  are soluble  and which  are
not? In your previous  chemistry  course,  you learned  a set of solubility
guidelines.  Table 9.3 summarizes  these guidelines.  Remember:  the higher
guideline  takes precedence.  (For instance,  guideline  3 says that carbonates
have very low solubility.  Sodium  carbonate  is soluble,  however,  because
guideline  1 says that ionic compounds  containing  sodium  are soluble.)
Chemists  do not usually  work with solubility  products  for soluble
compounds.  Thus, you will not find soluble  ionic compounds  listed in Aj,
tables. If you see a compound  in a &,, table, you know that it has a low
solubility  relative  to compounds  such as sodium  chloride.

For example,  silver nitrate  and sodium  chloride  are both soluble  ionic
compounds.  When they are mixed  in solution,  however,  they react to form
silver chloride,  as shown  in Figure 9.7. The equation  for the reaction  is:
AgNOx(aq)  + NaCliaq) = AgCls) + NaNOs(aq)
Silver chloride  has a very low solubility.  Therefore,  a precipitate  will form
even if the initial concentration  of chloride  and silver ions is very small.
The following  Sample  Problems  show you how to decide  whether  a
precipitate  will form under a given set of conditions.

Problem
A common  test for chloride  ions in a solution  involves  adding  AgNOsvag)
to the solution  being tested. If chloride  ions are present  in sufficient
quantity,  the chemist  will observe  a white cloudiness  that indicates  the
formation  of a precipitate.  Ks, for silver chloride  is 1.8 x 107'°.
A drop (0.050 mL) of 6.0 mol/L silver nitrate  is added  to 1.0 L of
0.10 mol/L sodium  chloride.  Does a precipitate  of silver chloride  form?
What Is Required?
Will silver chloride  precipitate  under  the given conditions?
What Is Given?
You know the concentration  and volume  of the silver nitrate  and sodium
chloride  solutions.  For AgNOs,  c = 6.0 mol/L and V = 0.050 mL.
For NaCl, c = 0.10 mol/L and V = 1.0 L. You also know Kg, for silver
chloride.
Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Determine  the concentrations  of silver ions and chloride  ions in
the reaction  mixture.
Step 2 Substitute  the ion concentrations  into the ion product  expression
for silver chloride  to determine  Qsp.
Step 3 Compare  Q,, with K,,, and predict  whether  or not a precipitate
will form.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 Because  the volume  of the AgNOs solution  is much smaller  than
the volume  of the NaCl solution,  you can ignore it. In other words,
assume  that the final volume  of the reaction  mixture  is 1.0 L.

A chemist  mixes 100.0 mL of 0.25 mol/L Ca(NO3)2  with 200.0 mL of
0.070 mol/L NaF. Does a precipitate  form?
What Is Given?
You know the initial concentration  and volume  of the calcium  nitrate
and sodium  fluoride  solutions.  For Ca(NO3)2,  c = 0.25 mol/L and
V = 100.0 mL. For NaF, c = 0.070 mol/L and V = 200.0 mL. As well,

tiie:  s-@ Chemists  use a
centrifuge  to separate  a precipitate
from a solution.  The centrifuge
spins the samples  quickly,  and the
resulting  force pushes  the precipi-
tate to the bottom  of the test tube.
The solution  can then be decanted.Analytical  Applications  of Precipitation  Reactions
In the previous  Sample  Problems,  you saw that combining  solutions  of
soluble  ionic compounds  can cause the precipitation  of a slightly  soluble
ionic compound.  Analytical  chemists  use precipitation  reactions  to
remove  ions from solution  or to identify  ions in an unknown  solution.
Fractional  Precipitation
Suppose  a chemist  has a solution  that contains  several  similar  ions. The
chemist  wants to remove  some of these ions, while leaving  other ions in
solution.  One way to do this is by fractional  precipitation:  a process  in
which  ions are selectively  precipitated  from solution,  leaving  other ions.
For example,  consider  a solution  that contains  three halide ions: CI,
Br, and [-. Since these halides  all come from the same group on the
periodic  table, they share many properties.  When  they are the anions  in
slightly  soluble  ionic compounds,  however,  they have different  solubilities.
(See Table 9.4.) Therefore,  chemists  can use fractional  precipitation  to
separate  them from solution.
Table 9.4 Values  of Ks, for Silver Halides
Silver halide | Kep
AgCl 1.8 x 1071°
AgBr 3.3 x 10718
Agl 1.5 x 10°76
Out of the three compounds,  silver chloride  is the most soluble  and
silver iodide is the least soluble.  (You can compare  the solubilities  of
the compounds  based on their solubility  products  because  they are all
the same type. Each formula  unit contains  two ions.)
To separate  the halide ions, a chemist  adds silver ions to the solution
until most of the iodide ions precipitate  out as AgIl. The chemist  stops
adding  silver ions before  AgBr begins  to precipitate.  The chemist  then
removes  the solid Agl by filtration  or by using a centrifuge,  as shown  in
Figure 9.8. To remove  the bromide  ions, the chemist  repeats  the process
with the remaining  solution.  The chemist  adds silver ions until most of
the bromide  ions precipitate  out as AgBr, but stops adding  ions before
AgCl begins  to precipitate.  By filtering  or centrifuging  again, the chemist
obtains  a solution  that contains  only chloride  ions.

example,  some ions, such as sodium,  Na‘, and potassium,  K*, cannot  be

An Issue to
Earth in Equilibrium
Background
Scientists  often think about Earth as being composed
of four main systems.  The biosphere  includes  all
living things on Earth. The geosphere  includes
non-living  things,  such as rocks and soil. The
hydrosphere  includes  all water, such as oceans,
rivers, and even puddles.  The atmosphere  includes
gases, vapours,  and aerosols.  These four systems
overlap  in many ways. For example,  animals  are part
of the biosphere,  but they interact  with components
in the geosphere  (living  in a burrow  or cave), the
hydrosphere  (drinking  and excreting  water),  and the
atmosphere  (breathing).
Earth, with its four spheres,  is a good approximation
of a closed system.  As you learned  in Unit 4, a
closed  system  is subject  to the principles  of equilib-
rium. Every change  to the system  affects  the whole
equilibrium.  Elements  such as carbon,  nitrogen,
sulfur, and oxygen  regularly  cycle through  Earth’s
four spheres.  Thus, Earth is in a constant  dynamic
equilibrium.
456 MHR-= Unit 4 Chemical  Systems  and EquilibriumScientists  have noticed  various  shifts in Earth’s
equilibrium  in recent  years. Since Earth is in a
dynamic  equilibrium,  some shifts occur naturally.
There is considerable  evidence,  however,  that the
following  shifts have been caused  by, or at least
strongly  influenced  by, human  activities.  Some of
these shifts may be familiar  to you, with names
99 66such as “global  warming,” “ozone holes,”  and “loss
of biodiversity.”
e an increase  in CO, and CH, levels in the
atmosphere
e an increase  in the amounts  and concentrations
of pollutant  substances
e a decrease  in ozone concentrations  in certain
parts of the atmosphere
e an increase  in average  global  temperature
e a decrease  in arable  land and a corresponding
increase  in desert land
¢ a loss of plant and animal  species,  both by
observable  causes  and by unknown  causes
e an increase  in extreme  weather  conditions,
such as hurricanes  and tornadoes
For this unit issue, you will research  the carbon
cycle, either on your own or as part of a group.
Then, as a class, you will discuss  the consequences
of human  activities  on the carbon  cycle.
Plan and Present
@) Research  the carbon cycle. Include  a general
description  of how carbon  moves  through  the
geosphere,  biosphere,  hydrosphere,  and atmos-
phere. (Your teacher  may choose  to have some
members  of the class research  different  cycles,
such as the phosphorus  cycle or the nitrogen
cycle.)
@® Identify  specific  chemical  reactions  and process-
es that involve  the movement  of carbon  from one
system  to another.  Write balanced  equations  for
each reaction  or process  you identity.
® Use the reactions  and processes  you identified
in step 2, along with your knowledge  of equilib-
ria, to identify  factors  that can increase  or
decrease  the level of carbon  in each system.
@) Identify  human  influences  on the carbon cycle.
©® Choose at least one shift in Earth’s equilibrium
that is listed in “Background.”  For each shift
you choose,  answer  the following  questions.
(a) Is the carbon  cycle involved?  Explain  your
answer.
(b) Where on Earth do you think this shift is
most visible?  Explain  why you think so.
(c) What are some possible  causes of this shift?
(d) What are some possible  consequences?
® If you come across information  about a shift in
Earth’s  equilibrium  that is not listed in
“Background,”  include  a description  of this
shift with your research.
@) Have  a class discussion  on the following  topics.
(a) To what extent  do human  activities  affect the
carbon  cycle? Are the consequences  of any
human  activities  serious  enough  to consider
changing  these activities?
(b) If your answer  to the second  question  in part
(a) is yes, decide  on a priority  list of five
human  activities  that your class believes
should  be changed.
(c) Come up with an action  plan for your school
or community  to address  your concerns.Assessment
After you have explored  this issue, answer the following
questions  to assess  your work.
m Assess  your research  skills. Was your research  on
this issue correct  and thorough?  Did you use more
than one source?  How have your skills improved?
m Assess  your presentation  of information  to the
class. Did you use visual aids in your explanation?
Do you think everyone  understood  what you were
trying to say?
= Assess  the class discussion.  Was a consensus
reached?  Do you think the consensus  was based
more on scientific  research  or on popular  media
opinion?
Evaluate  the Results
@) If your class developed  a priority  list of five
human  activities  that need changing,  list these
activities  in your notebook.  Explain  why each
activity  was chosen  to be on the list.
@® Describe  any solutions  or suggestions  that your
class developed.  Are these suggestions  likely to
work? Why or why not?
® Prepare  a report that summarizes  the results of
your own research  on the carbon  cycle.

at the end of the unit.Canadian engineer Dr. John Hopps,
working  with a team of medical
researchers  in the late 1940s,
developed  one of the most significant
medical  inventions  of the twentieth
century:  the pacemaker.  The photo-
graph on the right shows a pacemaker
embedded  in the body of a heart
patient. A modern  pacemaker  is
essentially  a tiny computer  that
monitors  a person’s  heartbeat  and
corrects  irregularities  as needed.
Pacemakers  are particularly  useful
in correcting  a heartbeat  that is
too slow.
The pacemaker  device  is
surgically  placed  in a “pocket”  of
tissue near the patient’s  collarbone.
One or more wires, called “leads,”
are connected  to the pacemaker  and
threaded  down through  a major vein
to the patient’s  heart. By sending
electrical  impulses  along the leads to
the heart, the pacemaker  can induce
a heartbeat.
A pacemaker  obtains  electrical
energy  from a tiny battery  that lasts
for about seven years before it must
be replaced.  But how do batteries
supply  electrical  energy?  The answer

as electrochemistry.  In this unit,

K stcnen chemistry is an important  part of daily life. Cooks use chemistry
all the time to prepare  and preserve  food. Even the simplest  things you
do in the kitchen  can involve  chemical  reactions.  For example,  you have
probably  seen  a sliced apple turn brown.  The same thing happens  to pears,
bananas,  avocados,  and several  other fruits. Slicing  the fruit exposes  the
flesh to oxygen  in the air. Compounds  in the fruit react with oxygen  to form
brown  products.  An enzyme  in the fruit acts as a catalyst,  speeding  up this
reaction.  How can you stop fruit from turning  brown  after it is sliced?
A Waldorf  salad uses a simple  method  to prevent  fruit from browning.
This type of salad usually  consists  of diced apples,  celery, and walnuts,
covered  with a mayonnaise  dressing.  The dressing  keeps the air away
from the food ingredients.  Without  air, the fruit does not turn brown.
Another  way to solve this problem  is to prevent  the enzyme  in the
fruit from acting as a catalyst.  Enzymes  are sensitive  to pH. Therefore,
adding  an acid such as lemon  juice or vinegar  to fruit can prevent  the
enzyme  from acting. You may have noticed  that avocado  salad recipes
often include  lemon  juice. In addition  to hindering  the enzyme,  lemon
juice contains  vitamin  C, which is very reactive  toward  oxygen.  The
vitamin  C reacts with oxygen  before the sliced fruit can do so.
In this chapter,  you will be introduced  to oxidation-reduction
reactions,  also called redox reactions.  You will discover  how to identify
this type of reaction.  You will also find out how to balance  equations  for
a redox reaction.
A redox reaction  causes
fruit to go brown.  How
can you recognize  other
redox reactions?
464 MHR- Unit 5 Electrochemistry
Defining  Oxidation  and Reduction
The term oxidation  can be used to describe  the process  in which
certain  fruits turn brown  by reacting  with oxygen.  The original,  historical
definition  of this term was “to combine  with oxygen.”  Thus, oxidation
occurred  when iron rusted,  and when magnesium  was burned  in oxygen
gas. The term reduction  was used historically  to describe  the opposite
of oxidation,  that is, the formation  of a metal from its compounds.  An ore
is a naturally  occurring  solid compound  or mixture  of compounds  from
which  a metal can be extracted.  Thus, the process  of obtaining  a metal
from an ore was known  as a reduction.  Copper  ore was reduced  to yield
copper,  and iron ore was reduced  to yield iron.
As you will learn in this chapter,  the modern  definitions  for oxidation
and reduction  are much broader.  The current  definitions  are based on the
idea of electron  transfers,  and can now be applied  to numerous  chemical
reactions.  In Unit 1, you saw the terms oxidation  and reduction  used to
describe  changes  to carbon-hydrogen  and carbon-oxygen  bonds within
organic  compounds.  These changes  involve  electron  transfers,  so the
broader  definitions  that you will learn in this chapter  still apply.
In your previous  chemistry  course,  you compared  the reactivities  of
metals.  You may recall that, when  a piece of zinc is placed  in an aqueous
solution  of copper(I)  sulfate,  the zinc displaces  the copper  in a single
displacement  reaction.  This reaction  is shown  in Figure 10.1. As the
zinc dissolves,  the zinc strip gets smaller. A dark red-brown  layer of
solid copper  forms on the zinc strip, and some copper  is deposited  on
the bottom  of the beaker.  The blue colour  of the solution  fades, as blue
copper(ID  ions are replaced  by colourless  zinc ions.
(GETICEDSY  A solid zinc strip reacts with a solution  that contains  blue copper(II)  ions.In this section,  you will

From your earlier  work, you
will recognize  the sulfate ion,
$0.2, as a polyatomic  ion. To
review  the names and formulas
of common  polyatomic  ions,
refer to Appendix  E, Table E.5.
\ /
Try using a mnemonic  to
remember  the definitions  for
oxidation  and reduction.  For
example,  in “LEO the lion says
GER,” LEO stands  for “Loss of
Electrons  is Oxidation.”  GER
stands  for “Gain of Electrons
is Reduction.”  The mnemonic
“OIL RIG” stands for
“Oxidation  Is Loss. Reduction
Is Gain.” Make up your own
mnemonic  to help you remem-
ber these definitions.
S JThe reaction  in Figure 10.1 is represented  by the following  equation.
ZN) + CuSOa(ag)  > Cus) + ZNSO4(aq)
This equation  can be written  as a total ionic equation.
Zs) + Cu**(aq)  + SOa (aq) > Cus) + Z?*fag) + SO4? (ag)
The sulfate  ions are spectator  ions, meaning  ions that are not involved
in the chemical  reaction.  By omitting  the spectator  ions, you obtain  the
following  net ionic equation.
ZMs) + Cu**(aq)  —-> Cus) + Zn** (aq)
Notice  what happens  to the reactants  in this equation.  The zinc atoms
lose electrons  to form zinc ions. The copper  ions gain electrons  to form
copper  atoms. ng 26
gains 2e
ZN(s) + Cu”* (aq) > Cus) + Zn”* (aq)
loses 2e~
The following  chemical  definitions  describe  these changes.
e Oxidation  is the loss of electrons.
e Reduction  is the gain of electrons.
In the reaction  of zinc atoms with copper(ID  ions, the zinc atoms lose
electrons  and undergo  oxidation.  In other words,  the zinc atoms are
oxidized.  The copper(II)  ions gain electrons  and undergo  reduction.
In other words,  the copper(II)  ions are reduced.  Because  oxidation  and
reduction  both occur in the reaction,  it is known  as an oxidation-reduction
reaction  or redox reaction.
Notice  that electrons  are transferred  from zinc atoms to copper(II)
ions. The copper(I  ions are responsible  for the oxidation  of the zinc
atoms. A reactant  that oxidizes  another  reactant  is called an oxidizing
agent. The oxidizing  agent accepts  electrons  in a redox reaction.  In this
reaction,  copper(II)  is the oxidizing  agent. The zinc atoms are responsible
for the reduction  of the copper(I)  ions. A reactant  that reduces  another
reactant  is called a reducing  agent. The reducing  agent gives or donates
electrons  in a redox reaction.  In this reaction,  zinc is the reducing  agent.
A redox reaction  can also be defined  as a reaction  between  an
oxidizing  agent and a reducing  agent, as illustrated  in Figure 10.2.
Zs) oP Cu** (aq) > Cus) + Zn" (aq)

GEEESETYA  Ina redox reaction,  the reducing  agent is oxidized,  and the oxidizing
agent is reduced.  Note that the oxidizing  agent does not undergo  oxidation,  and that
the reducing  agent does not undergo  reduction.

\ y,
Half-Reactions
To monitor  the transfer  of electrons  in a redox reaction,  you can
represent  the oxidation  and reduction  separately.  A half-reaction  is a
balanced  equation  that shows the number  of electrons  involved  in either
oxidation  or reduction.  Because  a redox reaction  involves  both oxidation
and reduction,  two half-reactions  are needed  to represent  a redox reaction.
One half-reaction  shows oxidation,  and the other half-reaction  shows
reduction.
As you saw earlier,  the reaction  of zinc with aqueous  copper(II)  sulfate
can be represented  by the following  net ionic equation.
ZMs) + Cu*(aq)  => Cus) + Zn" (aq)
Each neutral  Zn atom is oxidized  to form a Zn** ion. Thus, each Zn atom
must lose two electrons.  You can write an oxidation  half-reaction  to show
this change.
ZN(s) > Zn" (aq) + 2e°
Each Cu?* ion is reduced  to form a neutral  Cu atom. Thus, each Cu2* ion
must gain two electrons.  You can write a reduction  half-reaction  to show
this change.
Cu** (ag) + 2e° > Cu)
If you look again at each half-reaction  above,  you will notice that
the atoms and the charges  are balanced.  Like other types of balanced
equations,  half-reactions  are balanced  using the smallest  possible
whole-number  coefficients.  In the following  equation,  the atoms and
charges  are balanced,  but the coefficients  can all be divided  by 2 to give
the usual form of the half-reaction.
2Cu**  (aq) + 4e° > 2Cu)CONCEPT  CHECK
You can write separate
oxidation  and reduction  half-

substance  is reduced.  In a disproportionation  reaction,  however,  a single

For example,  a copper(I)  solution  undergoes  disproportionation  in the
following  reaction.

In this reaction,  some copper(I)  ions gain electrons,  while other copper(I)

You have learned  that half-reactions  can be used to represent  oxidation
and reduction  separately.  Half-reactions  always  come in pairs: an oxidation
half-reaction  is always  accompanied  by a reduction  half-reaction,  and vice

Aging:  Is Oxidation  a Factor?
Why do we grow old? Despite  advances  in
molecular  biology  and medical  research,  the
reasons  for aging remain  mysterious.  One
theory  suggests  that aging may be influenced
by oxidizing  agents,  also known  as oxidants.
Oxidants  are present  in the environment
and in foods. Nitrogen  oxides  are oxidants
present  in cigarette  smoke and urban smog.
Other oxidants  include  the copper  and iron
salts in meat and some plants.  Inhaling  and
ingesting  oxidants  such as these can increase
the level of oxidants  in our bodies.
Oxidants  are also naturally  present  in
the body, where they participate  in important
redox reactions.  For example,  mitochondria
consume  oxygen  during  aerobic  respiration,
and cells ingest and destroy  bacteria.  Both these
processes  involve  oxidation  and reduction.
As you have just seen, redox reactions
are an essential  part of your body’s  processes.
However,  these reactions  can produce  free
radicals,  which  are highly  reactive  atoms or
molecules  with one or more unpaired  electrons.
Because  they are so reactive,  free radicals  can
oxidize  surrounding  molecules  by robbing
them of electrons.  This process  can damage
DNA, proteins,  and other macromolecules.
Such damage  may contribute  to aging, and
to diseases  that are common  among  the aging,
such as cancer,  cardiovascular  disease,  and
cataracts.
The study of oxidative  damage  has sparked
a debate  about the role that antioxidants
might play in illness  and aging. Antioxidants
are reducing  agents.  They donate  electrons  to
substances  that have been oxidized,  decreasing
the damage  caused  by free radicals.  Dietary
antioxidants  include  vitamins  C and E,
beta-carotene,  and carotenoids.
Most medical  researchers  agree that people
with diets rich in fruits and vegetables  have
a lower incidence  of cardiovascular  disease,

Oxidation  Numbers
Redox  reactions  are very common.  Some of them produce  light in a
process  known  as chemiluminescence.  In living  things,  the production
of light in redox reactions  is known  as bioluminescence.  You can actually
see the light from redox reactions  occurring  in some organisms,  such as
glowworms  and fireflies,  as shown  in Figure 10.3.
| Figure 10.3 | Fireflies  use flashes of light produced  by redox reactions  to attract a mate.
Not all redox reactions  give off light, however.  How can you recognize  a
redox reaction,  and how can you identify  the oxidizing  and reducing
agents?  In section  10.1, you saw net ionic equations  with monatomic
elements,  such as Cu and Zn, and with ions containing  a single element,
such as Cu?* and Zn?*. In these cases, you could use ionic charges  to
describe  the transfer  of electrons.  However,  many redox reactions  involve
reactants  or products  with covalent  bonds,  including  elements  that exist
as covalent  molecules,  such as oxygen,  O2; covalent  compounds,  such
as water, H,O; or polyatomic  ions that are not spectator  ions, such as
permanganate,  MnO, . For reactions  involving  covalent  reactants  and
products,  you cannot  use ionic charges  to describe  the transfer  of electrons.
Oxidation  numbers  are actual or hypothetical  charges,  assigned  using
a set of rules. They are used to describe  redox reactions  with covalent
reactants  or products.  They are also used to identify  redox reactions,  and
to identify  oxidizing  and reducing  agents.  In this section,  you will see
how oxidation  numbers  were developed  from Lewis structures,  and then
learn the rules to assign oxidation  numbers.
Oxidation  Numbers  from Lewis Structures
You are probably  familiar  with the Lewis structure  of water, shown  in
Figure 10.4A. From the electronegativities  on the periodic  table in
Figure 10.5, on the next page, you can see that oxygen  (electronegativity
3.44) is more electronegative  than hydrogen  (electronegativity  2.20). The
electronegativity  difference  is less than 1.7, so the two hydrogen-oxygen
bonds are polar covalent,  not ionic. In each bond, the electrons  are more
strongly  attracted  to the oxygen  atom than to the hydrogen  atom.

Oxidation  numbers  are just a
bookkeeping  method used to
keep track of electron  trans-
fers. In a covalent  molecule  or
a polyatomic  ion, the oxidation
number  of each element  does
not represent  an ionic charge,
because  the elements  are not
present  as ions. However,  to
assign oxidation  numbers  to
the elements  in a covalent
molecule  or polyatomic  ion,
you can pretend  the bonds
are ionic.

structure  of water;  (B) The formal
counting  of electrons  with the

Chapter  10 Oxidation-Reduction  Reactions»  MHR 473
To assign  oxidation  numbers  to the atoms in a water molecule,  you
can consider  all the bonding  electrons  to be “owned”  by the more elec-
tronegative  oxygen  atom, as shown  in Figure 10.4B. Thus, each hydrogen
atom in a water molecule  is considered  to have no electrons,  as hydrogen
would  in a hydrogen  ion, H*. Therefore,  the element  hydrogen  is assigned
an oxidation  number  of +1 in water. On the other hand, the oxygen  atom
in a water molecule  is considered  to have  a filled octet of electrons,  as
oxygen  would in an oxide ion, O*-. Therefore,  the element  oxygen  is
assigned  an oxidation  number  of —2 in water. (Note: These are not ionic
charges,  since water is a covalent  molecule.  Also, note that the plus or
minus sign in an oxidation  number,  such as —2, is written  before  the
number.  The plus or minus sign in an ionic charge,  such as 2-, is written
after the number.)
GETTEEEY  The periodic  table, showing  electronegativity  values
In a chlorine  molecule,  Cl:, each atom has the same electronegativity,  so
the bond is non-polar  covalent.  Because  the electrons  are equally  shared,
you can consider  each chlorine  atom to “own” one of the shared  elec-
trons, as shown  in Figure 10.6. Thus, each chlorine  atom in the molecule
is considered  to have the same number  of electrons  as a neutral  chlorine
atom. Each chlorine  atom is therefore  assigned  an oxidation  number  of 0.

Figure  10.7 shows  how oxidation  numbers  are assigned  for the
polyatomic  cyanide  ion, CN. The electronegativity  of nitrogen  (3.04) is
greater  than the electronegativity  of carbon  (2.55). Thus, the three shared
pairs of electrons  are all considered  to belong  to the nitrogen  atom. As
a result,  the carbon  atom is considered  to have two valence  electrons,
which  is two electrons  less than the four valence  electrons  of a neutral
carbon  atom. Therefore,  the carbon  atom in CN” is assigned  an oxidation
number  of +2. The nitrogen  atom is considered  to have eight valence
electrons,  which  is three electrons  more than the five valence  electrons  of
a neutral  nitrogen  atom. Therefore,  the nitrogen  atom in CN” is assigned
an oxidation  number  of —3.

Using Rules to Find Oxidation  Numbers
Drawing  Lewis structures  to assign oxidation  numbers  can be a very
time-consuming  process  for large molecules  or large polyatomic  ions.
Instead,  the results  from Lewis structures  have been summarized  to
produce  a more convenient  set of rules, which  can be applied  more
quickly.  Table 10.1 summarizes  the rules used to assign oxidation
numbers.  You may have discovered  some of these rules for yourself  in
the ThoughtLab  you just completed.
Table 10.1 Oxidation  Number  Rules
Rules
1. A pure element  has an oxidation
number  of 0.Examples
Na in Na), Br in Brag, and P in Pa)
all have an oxidation  number  of 0.
2. The oxidation  number  of an element
in a monatomic  ion equals  the
charge  of the ion.The oxidation  number  of Al in Al*+
is +3. The oxidation  number  of Se in
Se? is —2.
3. The oxidation  number  of hydrogen
in its compounds  is +1, except  in
metal hydrides,  where  the oxidation
number  of hydrogen  is —1.The oxidation  number  of H in H2S or
CH, is +1. The oxidation  number  of H
in NaH or in CaHz is —1.
4. The oxidation  number  of oxygen  in
its compounds  is usually  —2, but
there are exceptions.  These include
peroxides,  such as H,Oz:, and the
compound  OF.The oxidation  number  of O in Li,O or
in KNOs is —2.
5. In covalent  compounds  that do not
contain  hydrogen  or oxygen,  the
more electronegative  element  is
assigned  an oxidation  number  that
equals  the negative  charge  it usually
has in its ionic compounds.The oxidation  number  of Cl in PCl; is
—1. The oxidation  number  of S in CS,
is —2.
6. The sum of the oxidation  numbers
of all the elements  in a compound
is 0.In CF,, the oxidation  number  of F is —1,
and the oxidation  number  of C is +4.
(+4) + 4(-1) =0
7. The sum of the oxidation  numbers
of all the elements  in a polyatomic
ion equals  the charge  on the ion.In NO,, the oxidation  number  of O is
—2, and the oxidation  number  of N is +3.
(+3) + 2(-2) =-1
Some oxidation  numbers  found using these rules are not integers.  For
example,  an important  iron ore called magnetite  has the formula  Fe3Q,.
Using the oxidation  number  rules, you can assign oxygen  an oxidation
number  of —2, and calculate  an oxidation  number  of +o for iron. However,
magnetite  contains  no iron atoms with this oxidation  number.  It actually
contains  iron(III)  ions and iron(II)  ions in a 2:1 ratio. The formula  of
magnetite  is sometimes  written  as Fe,0;3 «FeO to indicate  that there are
two different  oxidation  numbers.  The value +4 for the oxidation  number
of iron is an average  value.
2(+3) + (+2) 8= +—
3 3
Even though  some oxidation  numbers  found using these rules are
averages,  the rules are still useful for monitoring  electron  transfers  in
redox reactions.

(a) ¢ Because  the compound  SiBr, does not contain  hydrogen  or oxygen,
rule 5 applies.  Because  SiBr, is a compound,  rule 6 also applies.
e Silicon  has an electronegativity  of 1.90. Bromine  has an
electronegativity  of 2.96. From rule 5, therefore,  you can assign
bromine  an oxidation  number  of —1.

applies.
e Hydrogen  has its usual oxidation  number  of +1. Oxygen  has its
usual oxidation  number  of —2. The oxidation  number  of chlorine
is unknown,  so let it be x. You know from rule 6 that the sum of
the oxidation  numbers  is 0. Then,

X=7
The oxidation  number  of hydrogen  is +1. The oxidation  number

(c) * Because  the polyatomic  ion Cr,07*"  contains  oxygen,  rule 4
applies. Because  Cr2O7*  is a polyatomic  ion, rule 7 also applies. PROBLEM  TIP
e Oxygen  has its usual oxidation  number  of —2. When finding the oxidation
numbers  of elements  in ionic
compounds,  you can work
with the ions separately.  Fore The oxidation  number  of chromium  is unknown,  so let it be x.
You know from rule 7 that the sum of the oxidation  numbers  is —2.
Then, example, NayCr,07 contains

oxidation  number  of +2; Cu has an oxidation  number  of 0; and Zn?* has
an oxidation  number  of +2. Thus, there are changes  in oxidation  numbers

8 ) Historically,  the extraction  of a metal from its ore was known as
reduction.  One way to reduce  iron ore on an industrial  scale is to use
a huge reaction  vessel, 30 m to 40 m high, called a blast furnace.  The
reactants  in a blast furnace  are an impure  iron ore, such as Fe2O3,
mixed  with limestone,  CaCO3,  and coke, C, which  is made from coal.
The solid mixture  is fed into the top of the blast furnace.  A blast of
very hot air, at about 900°C, is blown  in near the bottom  of the furnace.
The following  reactions  occur.
Fe.,O3 + 3CO — 2Fe + 3CQO,
The limestone  is present  to convert  sand or quartz,  SiOz, which  is
present  as an impurity  in the ore, to calcium  silicate,  CaSiO3.

Redox reactions  are involved
in some very important  indus-
trial processes,  such as iron
and steel production.  However,
the widespread  use of metals
has occupied  a relatively  small
part of human history. In the
Stone Age, humans  relied
on stone, wood, and bone
to make tools and weapons.
The Stone Age ended in many
parts of the world with the
start of the Bronze  Age, which
was marked by the use of cop-
per and then bronze (an alloy
of copper  and tin). In the Iron
Age, bronze was replaced  by
the use of iron. The dates of
the Bronze  Age and the Iron
Age vary for different  parts of
the world.

Balancing  Equations
Did you know that redox reactions  are an important  part of CD
manufacturing?  The CDs you buy at a music store are made of Lexan®,
the same plastic  used for riot shields  and bulletproof  windows.  The CDs
are coated  with a thin aluminum  film. They are copies of a single master
disc, which  is made of glass coated  with silver, as seen in Figure 10.9.
Silver is deposited  on a glass disc by the reduction  of silver ions with
methanal,  HCHO,  also known  as formaldehyde.  In the same reaction,
formaldehyde  is oxidized  to methanoic  acid, HCOOH,  also known  as
formic  acid. The redox reaction  occurs  under acidic conditions.
The production  of CDs depends  on a redox reaction  used to coat the master
disc with silver.
You have seen many balanced  chemical  equations  and net ionic equations
that represent  redox reactions.  There are specific  techniques  for balancing
these equations.  These techniques  are especially  useful for reactions  that
take place under  acidic or basic conditions,  such as the acidic conditions
used in coating  a master  CD with silver.
In section  10.1, you learned  to divide the balanced  equations  for some
redox reactions  into separate  oxidation  and reduction  half-reactions.  You
will now use the reverse  approach,  and discover  how to write a balanced
equation  by combining  two half-reactions.  To do this, you must first
understand  how to write a wide range of half-reactions.

In the synthesis  of potassium  chloride  from its elements,  metallic
potassium  is oxidized  to form potassium  ions, and gaseous  chlorine  is
reduced  to form chloride  ions. This reaction  is shown  in Figure 10.10.
Each half-reaction  can be balanced  by writing  the correct  formulas  for

adding  the correct  number  of electrons  to balance  the charges.  For the

Balancing  half-reactions  is more complicated  for reactions  that take place
in acidic or basic solutions.  When an acid or base is present,  H* or OH”

Half-Reaction  Method  for Balancing  Redox Reactions
Recall that, if you consider  a redox reaction  as two half-reactions,
electrons  are lost in the oxidation  half-reaction,  and electrons  are gained
in the reduction  half-reaction.  For example,  you know the reaction  of
zinc with aqueous  copper(II)  sulfate.
Zs) + CuSOa(ag)  > Cus) + ZNSO4(aq)
Removing  the spectator  ions leaves the following  net ionic equation.
ZYs) + Cu** (ag) => Cus) + Zn* (aq)
e You can break the net ionic equation  into two half-reactions:
Oxidation  half-reaction:  Zn —> Zn?* + 2e7
Reduction  half-reaction:  Cu2* + 2e° > Cu
e You can also start with the half-reactions  and use them to produce  a net
ionic equation.  If you add the two half-reactions,  the result is as follows.
Zn + Cu2* + 2e > Cu + Zn2* + 2e7
Removing  the two electrons  from each side results  in the original  net
ionic equation.
As shown  above,  you can use half-reactions  to write balanced  net
ionic equations  for redox reactions.  In doing so, you use the fact that
no electrons  are created  or destroyed  in a redox  reaction.  Electrons
are transferred  from one reactant  (the reducing  agent) to another  (the
oxidizing  agent).
Balancing  a Net lonic Equation
You know from Investigation  10-A that magnesium  metal, Mg), displaces
aluminum  from an aqueous  solution  of one of its compounds,  such as
aluminum  nitrate,  Al(NO3)3(aq).  To obtain  a balanced  net ionic equation
for this reaction,  you can start by looking  at the half-reactions.  Magnesium
atoms undergo  oxidation  to form magnesium  ions, which  have a 2+
charge.  The oxidation  half-reaction  is as follows.
Mg — Mg?* + 2e7
Aluminum  ions, which  have a 3+ charge,  undergo  reduction  to form
aluminum  atoms. The reduction  half-reaction  is as follows.
Al?* + 3e > Al
486 MHR- Unit 5 Electrochemistry
To balance  the net ionic equation  for this redox reaction,  you can
combine  the two half-reactions  in such a way that the number  of electrons
lost through  oxidation  equals  the number  of electrons  gained  through
reduction.  In other words,  you can model the transfer  of a certain  number
of electrons  from the reducing  agent to the oxidizing  agent.
For the reaction  of magnesium  metal with aluminum  ions, the two
balanced  half-reactions  include  different  numbers  of electrons,  2 and 3.
The least common  multiple  of 2 and 3 is 6. To combine  the half-reactions
and give a balanced  net ionic equation,  multiply  the balanced  half-
reactions  by different  numbers  so that the results  both include  six
electrons,  as shown  below.
e Multiply  the oxidation  half-reaction  by 3. Multiply  the reduction
half-reaction  by 2.
3Mg > 3Mg** + 6e~
2Al** + 6e° > 2Al
e Add the results.
3Mg + 2Al** + 6 > 3Mg** + 2Al + 6€7
e Remove  6e” from each side to obtain  the balanced  net ionic equation.
3Mg + 2Al** — 3Mg** + 2Al
To produce  the balanced  chemical  equation,  you can include  the
spectator  ions, which  are nitrate  ions in this example.  Include  the states,
if necessary.  The balanced  chemical  equation  is:
3Mgis) + 2AL(NO3)a(aq)  = 3Mg(NOs)a(aq)  + 2AL(s)
Steps for Balancing  by the Half-Reaction  Method
You could balance  the chemical  equation  for the reaction  of magnesium
with aluminum  nitrate  by inspection,  instead  of writing  half-reactions.
However,  many redox equations  are difficult  to balance  by the inspection
method.  In general,  you can balance  the net ionic equation  for a redox
reaction  by a process  known  as the half-reaction  method.  The preceding
example  of the reaction  of magnesium  with aluminum  nitrate  illustrates
this method.  Specific  steps for following  the half-reaction  method  are
given below.
Step 1 Write an unbalanced  net ionic equation,  if it is not already
given.
Step 2 Divide  the unbalanced  net ionic equation  into an oxidation
half-reaction  and a reduction  half-reaction.  To do this, you
may need to assign oxidation  numbers  to all the elements  in
the net ionic equation  to determine  what is oxidized  and what
is reduced.
Step 3 Balance  the oxidation  half-reaction  and the reduction
half-reaction  independently.
Step 4 Determine  the least common  multiple  (LCM) of the numbers
of electrons  in the oxidation  half-reaction  and the reduction
half-reaction.
Continued  on the next pageThe lowest  or least common
multiple  (LCM) of two numbers
is the smallest  multiple  of each
number.  For example,  the LCM
of 2 and 1 is 2; the LCM of 3
and 6 is 6; and the LCM of 2
and 5 is 10. One way to find the
LCM of two numbers is to list
the multiples  of each number
and to find the smallest  num-
ber that appears  in both lists.
For the numbers  6 and 8,
e the multiples  of 6 are:
6, 12, 18, 24, 30,...
e the multiples  of 8 are:
8, 16, 24, 32, 40,...
Thus, the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24.

numbers  4 and 12?

Balancing  Redox Reactions  in Acidic  and Basic Solutions
The half-reaction  method  of balancing  equations  can be more complicated
for reactions  that take place under  acidic or basic conditions.  The overall
approach,  however,  is the same. You need to balance  the two half-reactions,
find the LCM of the numbers  of electrons,  and then multiply  by coefficients
to equate  the number  of electrons  lost and gained.  Finally,  add the half-
reactions  and simplify  to give a balanced  net ionic equation  for the
reaction.  The ten steps listed above show this process  in more detail.
The Sample  Problem  on the next page illustrates  the use of these
steps for an acidic solution.  To balance  a net ionic equation  for basic
conditions  by the half-reaction  method,  balance  each half-reaction  for
acidic conditions,  adjust for basic conditions,  and then combine  the
half-reactions  to obtain  the balanced  net ionic equation.  The following

The Breathalyzer  Test:
A Redox  Reaction
The police may pull over a driver  weaving
erratically  on the highway  on suspicion  of drunk
driving.  A police officer  must confirm  this suspicion
by assessing  whether  the driver has a blood
alcohol  concentration  over the “legal limit.” The
“Breathalyzer”  test checks  a person’s  breath
using a redox reaction  to determine  blood alcohol
concentration.  This test was invented  in 1953 by
Robert Borkenstein,  a former  member  of the Indiana
State Police,  and a professor  of forensic  studies.
What does a person’s  breath have to do with
the alcohol  in his or her blood?  In fact, there is a
direct correlation  between  the concentration  of
alcohol  in an exhaled  breath and the concentration
of alcohol  in the blood.
As blood moves  through  the lungs, it comes
in close contact  with inhaled  gases. If the blood
contains  alcohol,  the concentration  of alcohol  in
the blood quickly  reaches  equilibrium  with the
concentration  of alcohol  in each inhaled  breath.
Thus, the alcohol  content  in an exhaled  breath is a
measure  of the alcohol  concentration  in the blood
itself. For example,  if a person  has been drinking
alcohol,  every 2100 mL of air exhaled  contains
about  the same amount  of alcohol  as 1 mL of blood.
In the Breathalyzer  test, the subject  blows into a
tube connected  to a vial. The exhaled  air collects  in
the vial, which already  contains  a mixture  of sulfuric
acid, potassium  dichromate,  water, and the catalyst
silver nitrate.  The alcohol  reacts with the dichromate
ion in the following  redox reaction.16H" (aq) + 2Cr207*  (aq) + 3C2zH50H (ey >
(orange) ACr**  (aq) + 3C2H4O2\(aq)  qr 11H20 ye)
(green)
This reaction  is accompanied  by a visible  colour
change,  as orange  dichromate  ions become  green
chromiumiIll)  ions. The concentration  of alcohol  in
the blood is determined  by measuring  the intensity
of the final colour.
A recent modification  of the Breathalyzer  test
prevents  drivers  from starting  their cars if they have
been drinking.  Alcohol  ignition  locks involve  a type

Redox Reactions
and Balanced  Equations
A redox reaction  involves  the transfer  of
electrons  between  reactants.  A reactant  that
loses electrons  is oxidized  and acts as a reducing
agent. A reactant  that gains electrons  is reduced
and acts as an oxidizing  agent. Redox  reactions
can be represented  by balanced  equations.

The Oxidation  Number  Method
for Balancing  Equations
In section  10.2, you learned  that a redox reaction  involves  changes  in
oxidation  numbers.  If an element  undergoes  oxidation,  its oxidation
number  increases.  If an element  undergoes  reduction,  its oxidation In this section,  you will
number  decreases.  When balancing  equations  by the half-reaction  method = write balanced  equations  for
in section  10.3, you sometimes  used oxidation  numbers  to determine  the redox reactions  using the
reactant(s)  and product(s)  in each half-reaction. oxidation  number  method
In fact, you can use oxidation  numbers  to balance  a chemical
equation  by a new method.  The oxidation  number  method  is a method
of balancing  redox equations  by ensuring  that the total increase  in the
oxidation  numbers  of the oxidized  element(s)  equals  the total decrease
in the oxidation  numbers  of the reduced  element(s).
For example,  the combustion  of ammonia  in oxygen  produces  nitrogen
dioxide  and water.
NH; + O, ~ NO» + H,O
341 0 4-20 41-2
The oxidation  number  of nitrogen  increases  from —3 to +4, an increase
of 7. The oxidation  number  of oxygen  decreases  from 0 to —2, a decrease
of 2. The least common  multiple  of 7 and 2 is 14. In this case, two
nitrogen  atoms must react for every seven oxygen  atoms so that the total
increase  and decrease  in oxidation  numbers  both equal 14.
2NH, + £0, > NO; + H,0
Complete  the equation  by inspection.  If necessary,  eliminate  the fraction.
2NH, + 0, > 2NO, + 3H,0
4NH3 + 702 — 4NO2 + 6H20
A summary  of the steps of the oxidation  number  method  is given below.
The following  Sample  Problem  shows how these steps are applied.
Step1 Write an unbalanced  equation,  if it is not given.
Step 2 Determine  whether  the reaction  is a redox reaction  by
assigning  an oxidation  number  to each element  wherever  it
appears  in the equation.
Step 3 If the reaction  is a redox reaction,  identify  the element(s)  that
undergo  an increase  in oxidation  number  and the element(s)
that undergo  a decrease  in oxidation  number.
Step 4 Find the numerical  values  of the increase  and the decrease  in
oxidation  numbers.
Step5 Determine  the smallest  whole-number  ratio of the oxidized  and
reduced  elements  so that the total increase  in oxidation  num-
bers equals  the total decrease  in oxidation  numbers.
Step 6 Use the smallest  whole-number  ratio to balance  the numbers  of
atoms of the element(s)  oxidized  and the element(s)  reduced.

Step 7 Balance  the other elements  by inspection,  if possible.
Step8 For reactions  that occur in acidic or basic solutions,  include
water molecules,  hydrogen  ions, or hydroxide  ions as needed  to
balance  the equation.
Balancing  a Redox Equation  in Basic Solution
Problem
Write a balanced  net ionic equation  to show the formation  of iodine  by
bubbling  oxygen  gas through  a basic solution  that contains  iodide  ions.
Solution
Step 1 Write an unbalanced  equation  from the given information.
O.+lFT>  I,
Step 2 Assign  oxidation  numbers  to see if it is a redox  reaction.
O.+T  oI
0 -1 0
Because  iodide is oxidized  to iodine,  the reaction  is a redox
reaction.  Though  the product  that contains  oxygen  is unknown
at this stage, oxygen  must be reduced.
Step 3 Iodine  is the element  that undergoes  an increase  in oxidation
number.  Oxygen  is the element  that undergoes  a decrease  in
oxidation  number.
Step 4 Iodine  undergoes  an increase  in its oxidation  number  from
—1 to 0, an increase  of 1. Assume  that the oxidation  number  of
oxygen  after reduction  is its normal  value, that is, -2. Thus,
oxygen  undergoes  a decrease  in its oxidation  number  from
O to —2, a decrease  of 2.
Step5 A 2:1 ratio of iodine  atoms to oxygen  atoms ensures  that the total
increase  in oxidation  numbers  and the total decrease  in
oxidation  numbers  are both equal to 2. This is the smallest
whole-number  ratio.
Step 6 Use the ratio to balance  the numbers  of atoms of iodine  and oxy-
gen. Make sure there are two iodine  atoms for every oxygen  atom.
O.+ 40 > 2I,
Step 7 No other reactants  or products  can be balanced  by inspection.

10.3, for basic conditions,  start by assuming  that the conditions
are acidic. Add water molecules  and hydrogen  ions as necessaryExplain  why none of the
steps in the oxidation  number
method result in equations to balance  the atoms.

502 MHR-« Unit 5 Electrochemistry36. One of the most important  discoveries  in the
history  of the chemical  industry  in Ontario  was
accidental.  Thomas  “Carbide”  Willson
(1860-1915)  was trying to make the element
calcium  from lime, CaO, by heating  the lime
with coal tar. Instead,  he made the compound
calcium  carbide,  CaC,. This compound  reacts
with water to form a precipitate  of calcium
hydroxide  and gaseous  ethyne (acetylene).
Willson’s  discovery  led to the large-scale  use
of ethyne  in numerous  applications.
(a) Was Willson  trying to perform  a redox
reaction?  How do you know? Why do you
not need to know the substances  in coal tar
to answer  this question?
(b) Write a balanced  chemical  equation  for the
reaction  of calcium  carbide  with water. Is
this reaction  a redox reaction?
(c) An early use of Willson’s  discovery  was in
car headlights.  Inside a headlight,  the

produced  ethyne,  which  was burned  to
produce  light and heat. Write a balanced

Batteries come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, from the tiny
button  battery  in a watch, to a large and heavy car battery.  Although
you probably  use batteries  every day, they may still surprise  you. For
example,  did you know that you could make a battery  from a lemon
and two pieces of metal?  To make a lemon  battery,  you could insert
two different  electrodes,  such as copper  and zinc strips, into a lemon.
The battery  can provide  electricity  for a practical  use. For example,
the battery  can power  a small light bulb, or turn a small motor.
For obvious  reasons,  lemon  batteries  are not a convenient  way to
power  a portable  device,  such as a cell phone. Scientists  and inventors
have worked  to develop  a variety  of batteries  that are inexpensive,
compact,  and easy to store and to carry. Our society  uses vast numbers
of batteries.
What exactly  is a battery,  and how does it work? What is the
relationship  between  batteries  and the redox reactions  studied  in
Chapter  10? You will find out the answers  to these questions  in
this chapter.

Galvanic  Cells
You know that redox  reactions  involve  the transfer  of electrons  from
one reactant  to another.  You may also recall that an electric  current  is
a flow of electrons  in a circuit.  These two concepts  form the basis of
electrochemistry,  which  is the study of the processes  involved  in
converting  chemical  energy  to electrical  energy,  and in converting
electrical  energy  to chemical  energy.
As you learned  in Chapter  10, a zinc strip reacts with a solution
containing  copper(ID)  ions, forming  zinc ions and metallic  copper.  The
reaction  is spontaneous.  It releases  energy  in the form of heat; in other
words,  this reaction  is exothermic.
ZMs) + Cu**(aq) > Zn" (aq) + Cus)
This reaction  occurs on the surface  of the zinc strip, where electrons
are transferred  from zinc atoms to copper(ID  ions when these atoms and
ions are in direct contact. A common  technological  invention  called a
galvanic  cell uses redox reactions,  such as the one described  above,  to
release  energy  in the form of electricity.
The Galvanic  Cell
A galvanic  cell, also called a voltaic  cell, is a device  that converts
chemical  energy  to electrical  energy.  The key to this invention  is to
prevent  the reactants  in a redox reaction  from coming  into direct contact
with each other. Instead,  electrons  flow from one reactant  to the other
through  an external  circuit,  which  is a circuit  outside  the reaction  vessel.
This flow of electrons  through  the external  circuit  is an electric  current.
An Example  of a Galvanic  Cell: The Daniell  Cell
Figure 11.1 shows one example  of a galvanic  cell, called the Daniell  cell.
One half of the cell consists  of a piece of zinc placed  in a zinc sulfate
solution.  The other half of the cell consists  of a piece of copper  placed
in a copper(II)  sulfate  solution.  A porous  barrier,  sometimes  called a
semi-permeable  membrane,  separates  these two half-cells.  It stops the
copper(ID  ions from coming  into direct contact  with the zinc electrode.11.1

Daniell  (1790-1845).  In the photo-

solution  is placed  inside a porous
cup, which is placed  in a larger

Galvanic  cells are named after
the Italian doctor  Luigi Galvani
(1737-1798),  who generated
electricity  using two metals.
These cells are also called
voltaic cells, after the Italian
physicist  Count Alessandro
Volta (1745-1827),  who built
the first chemical  batteries.

GFETICEEP?  Atypical  galvanic
cell, such as the Daniell  cell shown
here, includes  two electrodes,
electrolyte  solutions,  a porous
barrier,  and an external  circuit.
Electrons  flow through  the external
circuit  from the negative  anode  to
the positive  cathode.
GPETESEER]  Batteries  contain
galvanic  cells. The + mark labels
the positive  cathode.  If there is a —
mark, it labels  the negative  anode.In a Daniell  cell, the pieces of metallic  zinc and copper  act as electrical
conductors.  The conductors  that carry electrons  into and out of a cell
are named  electrodes.  The zinc sulfate  and copper(II)  sulfate  act as
electrolytes.  Electrolytes  are substances  that conduct  electricity  when
dissolved  in water. (The fact that a solution  of an electrolyte  conducts
electricity  does not mean that free electrons  travel through  the solution.
An electrolyte  solution  conducts  electricity  because  of ion movements,
and the loss and gain of electrons  at the electrodes.)  The terms electrode
and electrolyte  were invented  by the leading  pioneer  of electrochemistry,
Michael  Faraday  (1791-1867).
The redox reaction  takes place in a galvanic  cell when an external
circuit,  such as a metal wire, connects  the electrodes.  The oxidation
half-reaction  occurs in one half-cell,  and the reduction  half-reaction
occurs in the other half-cell.  For the Daniell  cell:
Oxidation  (loss of electrons):  Zn() > Zn?*(aq)  + 2€7
Reduction  (gain of electrons):  Cu (aq) + 2e7 > Cuy)
The electrode  at which  oxidation  occurs  is named  the anode.  In this
example,  zinc atoms undergo  oxidation  at the zinc electrode.  Thus, the
zinc electrode  is the anode of the Daniell  cell. The electrode  at which
reduction  occurs  is named  the cathode.  Here, copper(II)  ions undergo
reduction  at the copper  electrode.  Thus, the copper  electrode  is the
cathode  of the Daniell  cell.
Free electrons  cannot  travel through  the solution.  Instead,  the external
circuit  conducts  electrons  from the anode to the cathode  of a galvanic
cell. Figure 11.2 gives a diagram  of a typical  galvanic  cell.
_ voltmeter _
e e
porous barrier cathode 7
At the anode of a galvanic  cell, electrons  are released  by oxidation.
For example,  at the zinc anode of the Daniell  cell, zinc atoms release
electrons  to become  positive  zinc ions. Thus, the anode of a galvanic
cell is negatively  charged.  Relative  to the anode,  the cathode  of a galvanic
cell is positively  charged.  In galvanic  cells, electrons  flow through  the
external  circuit  from the negative  electrode  to the positive  electrode.
These electrode  polarities  may already  be familiar  to you. An example
is shown  in Figure 11.3.
Each half-cell  contains  a solution  of a neutral  compound.  In a
Daniell  cell, these solutions  are aqueous  zinc sulfate  and aqueous
copper(II)  sulfate.  How can these electrolyte  solutions  remain  neutral
when electrons  are leaving  the anode of one half-cell  and arriving  at the
cathode  of the other half-cell?  To maintain  electrical  neutrality  in each
half-cell,  some ions migrate  through  the porous  barrier,  as shown  in
Figure 11.4, on the next page. Negative  ions (anions)  migrate  toward
the anode,  and positive  ions (cations)  migrate  toward  the cathode.

The separator  between  the half-cells  does not need to be a porous  barrier.
Figure 11.5 shows an alternative  device.  This device,  called a salt bridge,
contains  an electrolyte  solution  that does not interfere  in the reaction.
The open ends of the salt bridge  are plugged  with a porous  material,  such
as glass wool, to stop the electrolyte  from leaking  out quickly.  The plugs
allow ion migration  to maintain  electrical  neutrality.

Suppose  the salt bridge of a Daniell  cell contains  ammonium  chloride
solution,  NH,Cl(aq).  As positive  zinc ions are produced  at the anode,
negative  chloride  ions migrate  from the salt bridge  into the half-cell  that
contains  the anode.  As positive  copper(II  ions are removed  from solution
at the cathode,  positive  ammonium  ions migrate  from the salt bridge into
the half-cell  that contains  the cathode.
Other electrolytes,  such as sodium  sulfate  or potassium  nitrate,  could
be chosen  for the salt bridge.  Neither  of these electrolytes  interferes  in the
cell reaction.  Silver nitrate,  AgNO3(aq),  would  be a poor choice for the salt
bridge,  however.  Positive  silver ions would  migrate  into the half-cell  that
contains  the cathode.  Zinc displaces  both copper  and silver from solution,
so both copper(I)  ions and silver ions would  be reduced  at the cathode.
The copper  produced  would  be contaminated  with silver.GETECEERY  Ion migration  in
a Daniell  cell. Some sulfate  ions
migrate  from the copper(II)  sulfate
solution  into the zinc sulfate
solution.  Some zinc ions migrate
from the zinc sulfate  solution  into
the copper(II)  sulfate  solution.
GETEEEEY  This Daniell cell
includes  a salt bridge instead  of
a porous  barrier.  In a diagram,  the
anode may appear  on the left or on
the right.
Chapter  11 Cells and Batteries»  MHR 507
Galvanic  Cell Notation
A convenient  shorthand  method  exists for representing  galvanic  cells. The
shorthand  representation  of a Daniell  cell is as follows.
Zn | Zn?* || Cu2* | Cu
The phases  or states may be included.
Zn5) | Zn" (aq) | Cu**(aq) | Cus)
As you saw in Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5, the anode may appear  on the
left or on the right of a diagram.  In the shorthand  representation,  however,
the anode is always  shown on the left and the cathode  on the right. Each
single vertical  line, |, represents  a phase boundary  between  the electrode
and the solution  in a half-cell.  For example,  the first single vertical  line
shows that the solid zinc and aqueous  zinc ions are in different  phases  or
states. The double  vertical  line, ||, represents  the porous  barrier  or salt
bridge between  the half-cells.  Spectator  ions are usually  omitted.
Inert Electrodes
The zinc anode and copper  cathode  of a Daniell  cell are both metals,  and
can act as electrical  conductors.  However,  some redox reactions  involve
substances  that cannot  act as electrodes,  such as gases or dissolved
electrolytes.  Galvanic  cells that involve  such redox reactions  use inert
electrodes.  An inert electrode  is an electrode  made from a material  that
is neither  a reactant  nor a product  of the cell reaction.  Figure 11.6 shows
a cell that contains  one inert electrode.  The chemical  equation,  net ionic
equation,  and half-reactions  for this cell are given below.
Chemical  equation:  Phys) + 2FeCl3(aq) > 2FeCle(aq)  + PbCla(ag)
Net ionic equation:  Pby) + 2Fe?*(ag) > 2Fe?*(aq)  + PbTM* (aq)
Oxidation  half-reaction:  Phys) > Pb**(aq) + 2e7
Reduction  half-reaction:  Fe**(aq) + e° > Fe*(aq)
The reduction  half-reaction  does not include  a solid conductor  of
electrons,  so an inert platinum  electrode  is used in this half-cell.  The
platinum  electrode  is chemically  unchanged,  so it does not appear  in
the chemical  equation  or half-reactions.  However,  it is included  in the
shorthand  representation  of the cell.
Pb | Pb?* || Fe*+, Fe2*+ | Pt
A comma  separates  the formulas  Fe** and Fe?* for the ions involved  in the
reduction  half-reaction.  The formulas  are not separated  by a vertical  line,
because  there is no phase boundary  between  these ions. The Fe** and Fe**
ions exist in the same aqueous  solution.

Introducing  Cell Potentials
You know that water spontaneously  flows from a higher  position  to
a lower position.  In other words,  water flows from  a state of higher
gravitational  potential  energy  to a state of lower gravitational  potential
energy.  As water flows downhill,  it can do work, such as turning  a water
wheel or a turbine.  The chemical  changes  that take place in galvanic
cells are also accompanied  by changes  in potential  energy.  Electrons
spontaneously  flow from a position  of higher  potential  energy  at the
anode to a position  of lower potential  energy  at the cathode.  The moving
electrons  can do work, such as lighting  a bulb or turning  a motor.
The difference  between  the potential  energy  at the anode and the
potential  energy  at the cathode  is the electric  potential,  FE, of a cell. The
unit used to measure  electric  potential  is called the volt, with symbol  V.
Because  of the name of this unit, electric  potential  is more commonly
known  as cell voltage.  Another  name for it is cell potential.  A cell
potential  can be measured  using an electrical  device called a voltmeter.
A cell potential  of 0 V means that the cell has no electric  potential,
and no electrons  will flow. You know that you can generate  electricity
by connecting  a zinc electrode  and a copper  electrode  that have been
inserted  into a lemon.  However,  you cannot  generate  electricity  by
connecting  two copper  electrodes  that have been inserted  into the lemon.
The two copper  electrodes  are the same and are in contact  with the same
electrolyte.  There is no potential  difference  between  the two electrodes.
Electric  potentials  vary from one cell to another,  depending  on various
factors.  You will examine  some of these factors  in the next investigation.CONCEPT  CHECK
The cell voltage  is sometimes
called the electromotive  force,
abbreviated  emf. However,
this term can be misleading.
A cell voltage  is a potential
difference,  not a force. The
unit of cell voltage,  the volt,
is not a unit of force.

Procedure
1. Use tape or a permanent  marker  to label the
outside  of nine wells of your egg carton  with
the nine different  half-cells.  Each well should
correspond  to one of the eight different
metal/metal  ion pairs: Mg/Mg**,  Cu/Cu?*,
Al/Al**,  Ni/Ni**,  Zn/Zn?*,  Sn/Sn**,  Fe/Fe*,
and Ag/Ag*.  Label the ninth well H*/H).
2. Prepare  a 9 x 9 grid in your notebook.  Label
the nine columns  to match  the nine half-cells.
Label the nine rows in the same way. You
will use this chart to mark the positive  cell
potentials  you obtain  when you connect  two
half-cells  to build a galvanic  cell. You will
also record  the anode and the cathode  for
each galvanic  cell you build. (You may not
need to fill out the entire chart.)
3. Sand each of the metals  to remove  any oxides.
4. Pour 5 mL of each metal salt solution  into the
appropriate  well of the egg carton.  Pour 5 mL
of the nitric acid into the well labelled  H*/H,.
5. Prepare  your salt bridge  as follows.
(a) Roll a small piece of cotton  batting  so that
it forms a plug about the size of a grain
of rice. Place the plug in one end of your
aquarium  tubing,  but leave a small amount
of the cotton  hanging  out, so you can
remove  the plug later.
(b) Fill a disposable  pipette  as full as possible
with the 1 mol/L KNO; electrolyte  solution.
Fit the tip of the pipette  firmly into the
open end of the tubing.  Slowly  inject the
electrolyte  solution  into the tubing.  Fill the
tubing completely,  so that the cotton on the
other side becomes  wet.
(c) With the tubing  completely  full, insert
another  cotton  plug into the other end.
There should  be no air bubbles.  (You may
have to repeat  this step from the beginning
if you have air bubbles.)
6. Insert each metal strip into the corresponding
well. Place the graphite  rod in the well with
the nitric acid. The metal strips and the
graphite  rod are your electrodes.
7. Attach  the alligator  clip on the red lead to the
red probe of the voltmeter.  Attach  the black
lead to the black probe.
8. Choose  two wells to test. Insert one end of the
salt bridge into the solution  in the first well.
Insert the other end of the salt bridge into
the solution  in the second  well. Attach  a free
alligator  clip to the electrode  in each well.
(Note: The graphite  electrode  is very fragile.
Be gentle when using it.) You have built a
galvanic  cell.
9. If you get a negative  reading,  switch  the
alligator  clips. Once you obtain  a positive
value, record  it in your chart. The black lead
should  be attached  to the anode (electrons
flowing  into the voltmeter).  Record  which
metal is acting as the anode and which  is
acting as the cathode  in this galvanic  cell.
10. Remove  the salt bridge and wipe any excess
salt solution  off the outside  of the tubing.
Remove  the alligator  clips from the electrodes.
11. Repeat  steps 8 to 10 for all other combinations
of electrodes.  Record  your results.
12. Reattach  the leads to the silver and
magnesium  electrodes,  and insert your salt
bridge  back into the two appropriate  wells.
While observing  the reading  on the voltmeter,
slowly  add 5 mL of saturated  NaCl solution  to
the Ag/Ag*  well to precipitate  AgCl. Record
any changes  in the voltmeter  reading.  Observe
the Ag/Ag*  well.
13. Rinse off the metals  and the graphite  rod with
water. Dispose  of the salt solutions  into the
heavy  metal salts container  your teacher  has
set aside. Rinse out your egg carton.  Remove
and discard  the plugs of the salt bridge,  and
dispose  of the KNO3 solution  as directed  by
your teacher.  Return  all your materials  to their
appropriate  locations.Analysis

cell battery  is shown  whole,  and

The Daniell  cell is fairly large and full of liquid.  Realistically,  you could
not use this type of cell to power  a wristwatch,  a remote  control,  or a
flashlight.  Galvanic  cells have been modified,  however,  to make them
more useful.
The Dry Cell Battery
A dry cell is a galvanic  cell with the electrolyte  contained  in a paste
thickened  with starch. This cell is much more portable  than the Daniell
cell. The first dry cell, invented  by the French  chemist  Georges  Leclanché
in 1866, was called the Leclanché  cell.
Modern  dry cells are closely  modelled  on the Leclanché  cell, and also
contain  electrolyte  pastes.  You have probably  used dry cells in all kinds of
applications,  such as lighting  a flashlight,  powering  a remote  control,  or
ringing  a doorbell.  Dry cells are inexpensive.  The cheapest  AAA-, AA-, C-,
and D-size 1.5-V batteries  are dry cells.
A battery  is defined  as a set of galvanic  cells connected  in series. The
negative  electrode  of one cell is connected  to the positive  electrode  of the
next cell in the set. The voltage  of a set of cells connected  in series is the
sum of the voltages  of the individual  cells. Thus, a 9-V battery  contains
six 1.5-V dry cells connected  in series. Often, the term “battery”  is also
used to describe  a single cell. For example,  a 1.5-V dry cell battery
contains  only  a single cell.
A dry cell battery  stops producing  electricity  when the reactants
are used up. This type of battery  is disposable  after it has run down
completely.  A disposable  battery  is known  as a primary  battery.  Some
other batteries  are rechargeable.  A rechargeable  battery  is known  as
a secondary  battery.  The rest of this section  will deal with primary
batteries.  You will learn about secondary  batteries  in section  11.3.
A dry cell contains  a zinc anode and an inert graphite  cathode,  as
shown  in Figure 11.7. The electrolyte  is a moist paste of manganese(IV)
oxide, MnOz,  zinc chloride,  ZnCl»,  ammonium  chloride,  NH,Cl,  and
“carbon  black,”  C;,), also known  as soot.
The oxidation  half-reaction  at the zinc anode is already  familiar  to you.

The structure  of an alkaline  cell is similar  to the structure  of a dry cell.
Each type has a voltage  of 1.5 V.
Billions  of alkaline  batteries,  each containing  a single alkaline  cell, are
made every year. The ammonium  chloride  and zinc chloride  used in a dry
cell are replaced  by strongly  alkaline  (basic) potassium  hydroxide,  KOH.

The Button  Cell Battery
A button  battery  is much smaller  than an alkaline  battery.  Button  batteries
are commonly  used in watches,  as shown  in Figure 11.9. Because  of its
small size, the button  battery  is also used for hearing  aids, pacemakers,  and
some calculators  and cameras.  The development  of smaller  batteries  has
had an enormous  impact  on portable  devices,  as shown  in Figure 11.10.
Two common  types of button  batteries  both use a zinc container,
which  acts as the anode,  and an inert stainless  steel cathode,  as shown  in
Figure 11.11 on the next page. In the mercury  button  battery,  the alkaline
electrolyte  paste contains  mercury(I)  oxide, HgO. In the silver button
battery,  the electrolyte  paste contains  silver oxide, Ag,O. The batteries
have similar  voltages:  about 1.3 V for the mercury  cell, and about 1.6 V
for the silver cell.
The reaction  products  in a mercury  button  battery  are solid zinc oxide
and liquid mercury.  The two half-reactions  and the overall  equation  are

Explosives  Chemist
Fortunato  Villamagna  works as the vice-president  of
technology  for an Australian-owned  company  with
offices  worldwide,  including  Canada.  Villamagna’s
job has given him the opportunity  to invent new
products,  build chemical  plants,  and conduct
projects  in Africa and Australia.
Born in Italy, Villamagna  moved  to Canada
when he was eight. He grew up in Montréal,  where
his interest  in chemistry  was sparked  by a Grade 10
teacher.
At university,  Villamagna  gained  a greater
understanding  of the value of chemistry  research.
“Research  creates  new technologies  and concepts,
results  in new products  and services,  creates  jobs
and prosperity,  and in the end improves  people’s
lives,” he says. Villamagna  decided  to pursue
graduate  studies.  He obtained  a Masters  of Science
in physical  chemistry  at Concordia  University,  and
a Ph.D. in physical  chemistry  at McGill University.
Today,  Villamagna  leads a team of researchers
responsible  for developing  new products  and

Redox  reactions  play an important  role in
industrial  safety. Explosives  are used in controlled
ways in the mining,  highway,  and construction
industries.  The use of explosives  allows  modern
workers  to break up bedrock  and carry out
necessary  demolitions  from a safe distance.
Chemists  are involved  in the development  and
production  of explosives.  They are also involved
in making  recommendations  for the safe handling
and disposal  of explosives.
Many explosives  are based on redox reactions.
For example,  the decomposition  of nitroglycerin
into nitrogen,  carbon  dioxide,  water  vapour,  and
oxygen  is a redox reaction  that results  in a powerful
explosion.  The three nitrate groups  of a nitroglycerin
molecule  act as powerful  oxidizing  agents,  and the
glycerol  portion  of the compound  acts as a fuel.
Fuels are very easily oxidized.
Nitroglycerin  is highly  unstable  and can
explode  very easily. Therefore,  it is difficult  to
manufacture  and transport  safely.  Ammonium
nitrate,  an explosive  that can act as both an
oxidizing  agent and a reducing  agent, is often used
to modify  other explosives  such as nitroglycerin.
Ammonium  nitrate is one of the products  made
by Villamagna’s  company.

In section  11.1, you learned  that a cell potential  is the difference  between
the potential  energies  at the anode and the cathode  of a cell. In other
words,  a cell potential  is the difference  between  the potentials  of two
half-cells.  You cannot  measure  the potential  of one half-cell,  because  a
single half-reaction  cannot  occur alone. However,  you can use measured
cell potentials  to construct  tables of half-cell  potentials.  A table of
standard  half-cell  potentials  allows  you to calculate  cell potentials,  rather
than building  the cells and measuring  their potentials.  Table 11.1 includes
a few standard  half-cell  potentials.  A larger  table of standard  half-cell
potentials  is given in Appendix  E.

Table 11.1 and the larger table in Appendix  E are based on the following
conventions.
e Each half-reaction  is written  as a reduction.  The half-cell  potential
for a reduction  half-reaction  is called a reduction  potential.  Look at
the molecules  and ions on the left side of each half-reaction.  The most
easily  reduced  molecules  and ions (best oxidizing  agents),  such as F2,
MnO,_,  and Oz, are near the top of the list. The least easily reduced
molecules  and ions (worst  oxidizing  agents),  such as Na‘, Ca?*, and
HO, are near the bottom  of the list.
e The numerical  values of cell potentials  and half-cell  potentials  depend
on various  conditions,  so tables of standard  reduction  potentials  are true
when ions and molecules  are in their standard  states. These standard
states are the same as for tables of standard  enthalpy  changes.  Aqueous
molecules  and ions have a standard  concentration  of 1 mol/L.  Gases have
a standard  pressure  of 101.3 kPa or 1 atm. The standard  temperature
is 25°C or 298 K. Standard  reduction  potentials  are designated  by the
symbol  E°, where  the superscript  ° indicates  standard  states.
e Because  you can measure  potential  differences,  but not individual
reduction  potentials,  all values in the table are relative.  Each half-cell
reduction  potential  is given relative  to the reduction  potential  of the
standard  hydrogen  electrode,  which  has been assigned  a value of zero.
The design  of this electrode  is shown  in Figure 11.12.

Calculating  Standard  Cell Potentials
You can use Table 11.1 to calculate  the standard  cell potential  of the
familiar  Daniell  cell. This cell has its standard  potential  when the
solution  concentrations  are 1 mol/L,  as shown  in the shorthand
representation  below.
Zn | Zn?* (1 mol/L) || Cu?* (1 mol/L) | Cu
One method  to calculate  the standard  cell potential  is to subtract  the
standard  reduction  potential  of the anode from the standard  reduction
potential  of the cathode.
Method  1: F ‘cell =i  ‘cathode = 15“ama
For a Daniell  cell, you know that copper  is the cathode  and zinc is the
anode. The relevant  half-reactions  and standard  reduction  potentials  from
Table 11.1 are as follows.
Cu (aq) +2e =Cug) E = 0.342 V
Zn‘(aq)  + 20° = Zny) E* =-0.762  V
Use these values  to calculate  the cell potential.
E’cell = E’cathode  — E”anode
= 0.342 V - (-0.762  V)
= 0.342 V + 0.762 V
= 1.104 V
Thus, the standard  cell potential  for a Daniell  cell is 1.104 V.
The standard  cell potentials  of all galvanic  cells have positive  values,
as explained  in Figure 11.13, on the following  page. Figure 11.13 shows
a “potential  ladder”  diagram.  A “potential  ladder”  diagram  models  the
potential  difference.  The rungs on the ladder  correspond  to the values
of the reduction  potentials.

This calculation  of the standard  cell potential  for the Daniell  cell used
the mathematical  concept  that the subtraction  of a negative  number  is
equivalent  to the addition  of its positive  value. You saw that
0.342 V — (-0.762  V) = 0.342 V + 0.762 V
In other words,  the subtraction  of the reduction  potential  for a
half-reaction  is equivalent  to the addition  of the potential  for the reverse
half-reaction.  The reverse  half-reaction  of a reduction  is an oxidation.
The half-cell  potential  for an oxidation  half-reaction  is called an oxidation
potential.  If the reduction  half-reaction  is as follows,
Zn" (aq) +2e = Zng) E° =-0.762  V
then the oxidation  half-reaction  is
Zis) = Zn**(aq) + 26° E’ox = +0.762 V
To summarize,  the standard  cell potential  can also be calculated  as the
sum of a standard  reduction  potential  and a standard  oxidation  potential.
Method  2: FE cell = 15 eel + Fox
As shown  above,  you can obtain  the standard  oxidation  potential  from
a table of standard  reduction  potentials  by reversing  the reduction  half-
reaction,  and changing  the sign of the relevant  potential.  The reduction
and oxidation  half-reactions  for the previous  example  are as follows.
Cu**(aq)  + 20° = Cur) E'ted = 0.342 V
Znis) = Zn**(aq) + 2e7 Egy = +0.762  V
The calculation  of the standard  cell potential  using these standard
half-reaction  potentials  is as follows.
E’cell = E’rea + E“ox
= 0.342 V + 0.762 V
= 1.104 V
Finding  the difference  between  two reduction  potentials,  and finding
the sum of a reduction  potential  and an oxidation  potential  are exactly

Section  Summary
In this section,  you learned  that you can calculate  cell potentials  by
using tables of half-cell  potentials.  The half-cell  potential  for a reduction
half-reaction  is called a reduction  potential.  The half-cell  potential  for an
oxidation  half-reaction  is called an oxidation  potential.  Standard  half-cell
potentials  are written  as reduction  potentials.  The values of standard
reduction  potentials  for half-reactions  are relative  to the reduction  potential
of the standard  hydrogen  electrode.  You used standard  reduction  potentials
to calculate  standard  cell potentials  for galvanic  cells. You learned  two
methods  of calculating  standard  cell potentials.  One method  is to subtract
the standard  reduction  potential  of the anode from the standard  reduction
potential  of the cathode.  The other method  is to add the standard  reduction
potential  of the cathode  and the standard  oxidation  potential  of the anode.
In the next section,  you will learn about a different  type of cell, called an
electrolytic  cell.

524Electrolytic  Cells
For a galvanic  cell, you have learned  that the overall  reaction  is
spontaneous,  and that the cell potential  has a positive  value. A galvanic
cell converts  chemical  energy  to electrical  energy.  Electrons  flow from a
higher  potential  energy  to a lower potential  energy.  As described  earlier,
the flow of electrons  in the external  circuit  of a galvanic  cell can be
compared  to water flowing  downhill.
Although  water flows downhill  spontaneously,  you can also pump
water uphill.  This process  requires  energy  because  it moves  water from
a position  of lower potential  energy  to a position  of higher  potential
energy.  You will now learn about a type of cell that uses energy  to move
electrons  from lower potential  energy  to higher  potential  energy.  This
type of cell, called an electrolytic  cell, is a device  that converts  electrical
energy  to chemical  energy.  The process  that takes place in an electrolytic
cell is called electrolysis.  The overall  reaction  in an electrolytic  cell is
non-spontaneous,  and requires  energy  to occur. This type of reaction  is
the reverse  of a spontaneous  reaction,  which  generates  energy  when
it occurs.
Like a galvanic  cell, an electrolytic  cell includes  electrodes,  at least
one electrolyte,  and an external  circuit.  Unlike  galvanic  cells, electrolytic
cells require  an external  source of electricity,  sometimes  called the
external  voltage.  This is included  in the external  circuit.  Except  for the
external  source of electricity,  an electrolytic  cell may look just like a
galvanic  cell. Some electrolytic  cells include  a porous  barrier  or salt
bridge.  In other electrolytic  cells, the two half-reactions  are not separated,
and take place in the same container.
Electrolysis  of Molten  Salts
The electrolytic  cell shown  in Figure 11.14 decomposes  sodium  chloride
into its elements.  The cell consists  of a single container  with two inert
electrodes  dipping  into liquid sodium  chloride.  To melt the sodium
chloride,  the temperature  must be above its melting  point of about 800°C.
As in an aqueous  solution  of sodium  chloride,  the ions in molten  sodium
chloride  have some freedom  of movement.  In other words,  molten  sodium
chloride  is the electrolyte  of this cell.

MEHR * Unit 5 Electrochemistry
The external  source of electricity  forces electrons  onto one electrode.  As a
result, this electrode  becomes  negative  relative  to the other electrode.  The
positive  sodium  ions move toward  the negative  electrode,  where they gain
electrons  and are reduced  to the element  sodium.  At this temperature,
sodium  metal is produced  as a liquid. The negative  chloride  ions move
toward  the positive  electrode,  where they lose electrons  and are oxidized
to the element  chlorine,  a gas. As in a galvanic  cell, reduction  occurs  at
the cathode,  and oxidation  occurs  at the anode of an electrolytic  cell. The
half-reactions  for this electrolytic  cell are as follows.
Reduction  half-reaction  (occurs  at the cathode):  Na‘ + e& — Nav)
Oxidation  half-reaction  (occurs  at the anode):  2Cl(¢ > Cla + 2e7
Because  of the external  voltage  of the electrolytic  cell, the electrodes
do not have the same polarities  in electrolytic  and galvanic  cells. Ina
galvanic  cell, the cathode  is positive  and the anode is negative.  In an
electrolytic  cell, the anode is positive  and the cathode  is negative.
The electrolysis  of molten  sodium  chloride  is an important  industrial
reaction.  Figure 11.15 shows the large electrolytic  cell used in the
industrial  production  of sodium  and chlorine.  You will meet other

Electrolysis  of Water
The electrolysis  of aqueous  solutions  may not yield the desired  products.
Sir Humphry  Davy (1778-1829)  discovered  the elements  sodium  and
potassium  by electrolyzing  their molten  salts. Before  this discovery,  Davy
had electrolyzed  aqueous  solutions  of sodium  and potassium  salts. He
had not succeeded  in reducing  the metal ions to the pure metals  at the
cathode.  Instead,  his first experiments  had produced  hydrogen  gas. Where
did the hydrogen  gas come from?
When electrolyzing  an aqueous  solution,  there are two compounds
present:  water, and the dissolved  electrolyte.  Water  may be electrolyzed
as well as, or instead  of, the electrolyte.  The electrolysis  of water produces
oxygen  gas and hydrogen  gas, as shown  in Figure 11.16.
GETTEETETS  The electrolysis  of water produces  hydrogen  gas
at the cathode  and oxygen  gas at the anode.  Explain  why the volume
of hydrogen  gas is twice the volume  of oxygen  gas.
MIHR * Unit 5 Electrochemistry
The half-reactions  for the electrolysis  of water are given below.
Oxidation  half-reaction  (occurs  at the anode):
2H20(¢) > O2(¢) + 4H" (aq) + 4e7
Reduction  half-reaction  (occurs  at the cathode):
2H20 (0) +2e > Hap) + 20H (aq)
Because  the number  of electrons  lost and gained  must be equal, multiply
the reduction  half-reaction  by 2. Then add and simplify  to obtain  the
overall  cell reaction.
Overall  cell reaction:  2H20(¢)  > 2H) + Or)
The standard  reduction  potentials  are as follows.
O2(g) + 4H" (aq) +4e = 2H20,() EF’ =1.229  V
2H20)  + 2e° = Hag) + 20H (aq) EE" = —0.828  V
You can use these values  to calculate  the E%.1; value for the
decomposition  of water.
FE cell = FE cathode _ FE’ anode
= —0.828  V — 1.229 V
= -2.057  V
Therefore,
2H20(e)  > 2 Ho(g) + Ox) FE’cel]l = —2.057  V
The negative  cell potential  shows that the reaction  is not spontaneous.
Electrolytic  cells are used for non-spontaneous  redox reactions,  so all
electrolytic  cells have negative  cell potentials.
The standard  reduction  potentials  used to calculate  FE". for the
decomposition  of water apply only to reactants  and products  in their
standard  states. However,  in pure water at 25°C, the hydrogen  ions and
hydroxide  ions each have concentrations  of 1 x 10-’ mol/L. This is not
the standard  state value of 1 mol/L. The reduction  potential  values  for
the non-standard  conditions  in pure water are given below. The super-
script zero is now omitted  from the E symbol,  because  the values are no
longer  standard.
Oo) + 4H*(aq) + 46° = 2H20 EF = 0.815 V
2H,0(¢) + 260° > Hag) + 20H (aq) E =—0.414  V
Using these new half-cell  potentials,  E',.1 for the decomposition  of
pure water at 25°C by electrolysis  has a calculated  value of —-1.229  V.
Therefore,  the calculated  value of the external  voltage  needed  is 1.229.
In practice,  the external  voltage  needed  for an electrolytic  cell is
always  greater  than the calculated  value, especially  for reactions  involving
gases. Therefore,  the actual voltage  needed  to electrolyze  pure water is
greater  than 1.229 V. The excess  voltage  required  above the calculated
value is called the overvoltage.  Overvoltages  depend  on the gases
involved  and on the materials  in the electrodes.
When electrolyzing  water, there is another  practical  difficulty  to
consider.  Pure water is a very poor electrical  conductor.  To increase  the
conductivity,  an electrolyte  that does not interfere  in the reaction  is added
to the water.CONCEPT  CHECK

As stated previously,  an electrolytic  cell may have the same design  as a
galvanic  cell, except  for the external  source of electricity.  Consider,  for
example,  the familiar  Daniell  cell. (This cell was described  in section  11.1
and shown  in Figure 11.5.) By adding  an external  electrical  supply,  with a
voltage  greater  than the voltage  of the Daniell  cell, you can push electrons
in the opposite  direction.  By pushing  electrons  in the opposite  direction,
you reverse  the chemical  reaction.  Figure 11.17 shows  both cells, while
their properties  are compared  in Table 11.2.

In the galvanic  cell, the zinc anode gradually  dissolves.  The copper
cathode  grows as more copper  is deposited  onto it. In the electrolytic  cell,
the copper  anode gradually  dissolves.  The zinc cathode  grows as more
zinc is deposited  onto it. The process  in which  a metal is deposited,  or
plated,  onto the cathode  in an electrolytic  cell is known  as electroplating.
Electroplating  is very important  in industry,  as you will learn later in

Predicting  the Products  of Electrolysis  for an Aqueous  Solution
The comparison  of the Daniell  cell with the electrolytic  version  of the cell
appears  straightforward.  One reaction  is the reverse  of the other. However,
you have just learned  that the electrolysis  of an aqueous  solution  may
involve  the electrolysis  of water. How can you predict  the actual products
for this type of electrolysis  reaction?
To predict  the products  of an electrolysis  involving  an aqueous
solution,  you must examine  all possible  half-reactions  and their reduction
potentials.  Then, you must find the overall  reaction  that requires  the
lowest  external  voltage.  That is, you must find the overall  cell reaction
with a negative  cell potential  that is closest  to zero. The next Sample
Problem  shows  you how to predict  the products  of the electrolysis  of
an aqueous  solution.
In practice,  reaction  products  are sometimes  different  from the
products  predicted,  using the method  described  here. Predictions  are least
reliable  when the reduction  potentials  are close together,  especially  when
gaseous  products  are expected.  However,  there are many cases in which
the predictions  are correct.

Your Solution
Use a potential  ladder  diagram,  such as the one on the next page,
part A, to visualize  the cell potentials.  For an electrolytic  cell, the
half-reaction  at the anode is always  on the upper  rung, and the

Spontaneity  of Reactions
You know that galvanic  cells have positive  standard  cell potentials,  and
that these cells use spontaneous  chemical  reactions  to produce  electricity.
You also know that electrolytic  cells have negative  standard  cell potentials,
and that these cells use electricity  to perform  non-spontaneous  chemical
reactions.  Thus, you can use the sign of the standard  cell potential  to pre-
dict whether  a reaction  is spontaneous  or not under standard  conditions.

Predict  whether  each reaction  is spontaneous  or non-spontaneous  under
standard  conditions.
(a) Cdi.) + Cu** (aq) > Cd** (aq) + Cu) (b) Las) + 2CI (aq) —> 20 (aq) + Clo.)
Solution
(a) The two half-reactions  are as follows.
Oxidation  (occurs  at the anode):  Cd) > Cd?*(aq)  + 2€7
Reduction  (occurs  at the cathode):  Cu**(aq)  + 2€° > Cus)
The relevant  standard  reduction  potentials  are:
Cu** (aq) +2e = Cuy) E = 0.342 V
Cd**(aq) + 2€ = Cd) E° =-0.403  V
E’cell = E’cathode  — E”anode
= 0.342 V - (-0.403  V)
= 0.745 V
The standard  cell potential  is positive,  so the reaction  is spontaneous
under standard  conditions.
(b) The two half-reactions  are as follows.
Oxidation  (occurs  at the anode): 2Cl (aq) > Cla) + 2e7
Reduction  (occurs  at the cathode):  Inj.) + 2e° > 20 (aq)
The relevant  standard  reduction  potentials  are:
Clyi) +2e = 2CI (aq) E° = 1.358 V
Ing) + 20 = 20 (aq) E° = 0.536 V
E’cell = E’cathode  — E°anode
= 0.536 V — 1.358 V
= -0.822  V
The standard  cell potential  is negative,  so the reaction  is
non-spontaneous  under standard  conditions.

Rechargeable  Batteries
In section  11.1, you learned  about several  primary  (disposable) F 1
batteries  that contain  galvanic  cells. One of the most common  secondary
(rechargeable)  batteries  is found in car engines.  Most cars contain  a
lead-acid  battery,  shown  in Figure 11.18. When you turn the ignition,
a surge of electricity  from the battery  starts the motor.
When  in use, a lead-acid  battery  partially  discharges.  In other words,
the cells in the battery  operate  as galvanic  cells, and produce  electricity.
The reaction  in each cell proceeds  spontaneously  in one direction.  To
recharge  the battery,  a generator  driven  by the car engine  supplies
electricity  to the battery.  The external  voltage  of the generator  reverses
the reaction  in the cells. The reaction  in each cell now proceeds  non- Atypical  car

As the name suggests,  the materials  used in a lead-acid  battery
include  lead and an acid. Figure 11.19 shows  that the electrodes  in each
cell are constructed  using lead grids. One electrode  consists  of powdered
lead packed  into one grid. The other electrode  consists  of powdered
lead(IV)  oxide packed  into the other grid. The electrolyte  solution  is
fairly concentrated  sulfuric  acid, at about 4.5 mol/L.

You can see that the reaction  consumes  some of the lead in the anode,
some of the lead(IV)  oxide in the cathode,  and some of the sulfuric  acid.
A precipitate  of lead(ID)  sulfate  forms.
When  the battery  is recharged,  the half-reactions  and the overall  cell
reaction  are reversed.  In this reverse  reaction,  lead and lead(IV)  oxide are
redeposited  in their original  locations,  and sulfuric  acid is re-formed.

In practice,  this reversibility  is not perfect.  However,  the battery  can go
through  many charge/discharge  cycles before it eventually  wears out.
Many types of rechargeable  batteries  are much more portable  than a car
battery.  For example,  there is now a rechargeable  version  of the alkaline
battery.  Another  example,  shown  in Figure 11.20, is the rechargeable
nickel-cadmium  (nicad)  battery.  Figure 11.21 shows a nickel-cadmium  cell,
which  has a potential  of about 1.4 V. A typical  nicad battery  contains  three
cells in series to produce  a suitable  voltage  for electronic  devices.  When
the cells in a nicad battery  operate  as galvanic  cells, the half-reactions  and
the overall  cell reaction  are as follows.
Oxidation  (at the Cd anode):  Cdi.) + 20H (ag) > Cd(OH)a(s)  + 2e7
Reduction  (at the NiO(OH)  cathode):
NiO(OH)(s)  + H2,0e) +e —> Ni(OH)a(s)  + OH (aq)
Overall  cell reaction:
Cd(s) + ZNiO(OH);s)  + 2H20 (0) > Cd(OH)  (5) + Z2Ni(OH)a(s)
Like many technological  innovations,  nickel-cadmium  batteries  carry risks
as well as benefits.  After being discharged  repeatedly,  they eventually
wear out. In theory,  worn-out  nicad batteries  should  be recycled.  In
practice,  however,  many end up in garbage  dumps.  Over time, discarded
nicad batteries  release  toxic cadmium.  The toxicity  of this substance
makes  it hazardous  to the environment,  as cadmium  can enter the food
chain. Long-term  exposure  to low levels of cadmium  can have serious
medical  effects  on humans,  such as high blood pressure  and heart disease.
GETESREP 3) A nicad cell has a cadmium  electrode  and
another  electrode  that contains  nickel(III)  oxyhydroxide,  NiO(OH).
When the cell is discharging,  cadmium  is the anode.  When the
cell is recharging,  cadmium  is the cathode.  The electrolyte  is a
base, sodium  hydroxide  or potassium  hydroxide.

(GETECEEPZ]  A depiction of Faraday’s laboratory.
You know that a balanced  equation  represents  relationships  between
the quantities  of reactants  and products.  For a reaction  that takes place
in a cell, stoichiometric  calculations  can also include  the quantity  of
electricity  produced  or consumed.  Stoichiometric  calculations  in electro-
chemistry  make use of a familiar  unit—the  mole.
As a first step, you need information  about measurements  in
electricity.  You know that the flow of electrons  through  an external  circuit
is called  the electric  current.  It is measured  in a unit called  the ampere
(symbol  A), named  after the French  physicist  André  Ampére  (1775-1836).
The quantity  of electricity,  also known  as the electric  charge,  is the
product  of the current  flowing  through  a circuit  and the time for which  it
flows. The quantity  of electricity  is measured  in a unit called  the coulomb
(symbol  C). This unit is named  after another  French  physicist,  Charles
Coulomb  (1736-1806).  The ampere  and the coulomb  are related,  in that
one coulomb  is the quantity  of electricity  that flows through  a circuit  in
one second  if the current  is one ampere.  This relationship  can be written
mathematically.
charge (in coulombs)  = current  (in amperes)  x time (in seconds)
For example,  suppose  a current  of 2.00 A flows for 5.00 min. You can use
this information  to find the quantity  of electricity,  in coulombs.
5.00 min = 300s
2.00 A x 300 s = 600 C, or 6.00 x 10? C
538 =MHR« Unit 5 Electrochemistry
For stoichiometric  calculations,  you also need to know the electric  charge
on a mole of electrons.  This charge can be calculated  by multiplying
the charge on one electron  and the number  of electrons  in one mole
(Avogadro’s  number).  The charge on a mole of electrons  is known  as
one faraday  (1 F), named  after Michael  Faraday.

A rounded  value of 96 500 C/mol is often used in calculations.  Note that
this rounded  value has three significant  digits.
The information  you have just learned  permits  a very precise
control  of electrolysis.  For example,  suppose  you modify  a Daniell  cell
to operate  as an electrolytic  cell. You want to plate 0.1 mol of zinc onto
the zinc electrode.  The coefficients  in the half-reaction  for the reduction
represent  stoichiometric  relationships.  Figure 11.23 shows that two
moles of electrons  are needed  for each mole of zinc deposited.  Therefore,
to deposit  0.1 mol of zinc, you need to use 0.2 mol of electrons.

reactants  and products  and the amount  of electrons  transferred.

between  the amount  of electrons  and the amount  of an electrolysis  product.

Step1 Use the current  and the time to find the quantity  of electricity

Step 2 From the quantity  of electricity,  find the amount  of electrons
that passed  through  the circuit.
Step 3 Use the stoichiometry  of the relevant  half-reaction  to relate
the amount  of electrons  to the amount  of aluminum  produced.
Step 4 Use the molar mass of aluminum  to convert  the amount  of
aluminum  to a mass.

Check  Your Solution
The answer  is expressed  in units of mass. To check  your answer,  use
estimation.  If the current  were 1 A, then 1 mol of electrons  would  pass

much less than 96 500 s. Therefore,  much less than 1 mol of electrons

The preceding  Sample  Problem  gave an example  of the mathematical  use
of Faraday’s  law. Faraday’s  law states that the amount  of a substance
produced  or consumed  in an electrolysis  reaction  is directly  proportional
to the quantity  of electricity  that flows through  the circuit.
To illustrate  this statement,  think about changing  the quantity  of
electricity  used in the Sample  Problem.  Suppose  this quantity  were
doubled  by using the same current,  500 mA, for twice the time, 3 h.
As a result, the amount  of electrons  passing  into the cell would also be
doubled.
500 mA = 0.500 A
3h=2x1.5h
=2 x 5400 s
Quantity  of electricity  = 0.500 A x (2 x 5400 s)
=2 x 2700C
= 5400 C, or 5.40 x 10° C

Then, as you can see from the relevant  half-reaction,  the mass of
aluminum  produced  would  be doubled.  The mass of aluminum  produced
is clearly  proportional  to the quantity  of electricity  used.
In Investigation  11-C, you will apply Faraday’s  law to an electrolytic
cell that you construct.

to make pop cans contains  about
97% aluminum,  by mass. The other
elements  in the alloy are
magnesium,  manganese,  iron,
silicon,  and copper.Industrial  Extraction  and Refining  of Metals
Many metals,  and their alloys, are widely  used in modern  society.  The
enormous  variety  of metal objects  ranges  from large vehicles,  such as cars
and aircraft,  to small items, such as the pop cans shown  in Figure 11.24.
Extraction  is a process  by which  a metal is obtained  from an ore.
Some metals  are extracted  in electrolytic  cells. In section  11.3, you saw
the extraction  of sodium  from molten  sodium  chloride  in a Downs  cell.
Other  reactive  metals,  including  lithium,  beryllium,  magnesium,  calcium,
and radium,  are also extracted  industrially  by the electrolysis  of their
molten  chlorides.
One of the most important  electrolytic  processes  is the extraction
of aluminum  from an ore called  bauxite.  This ore is mainly  composed
of hydrated  aluminum  oxide, Al,O3 + xH,O. (The “x” in the formula
indicates  that the number  of water molecules  per formula  unit is variable.)
In industry,  the scale of production  of metals  is huge. The electrolytic
production  of aluminum  is over two million  tonnes  per year in Canada
alone. As you know from Faraday’s  law, the amount  of a metal produced
by electrolysis  is directly  proportional  to the quantity  of electricity  used.
Therefore,  the industrial  extraction  of aluminum  and other metals  by
electrolysis  requires  vast quantities  of electricity.  The availability  and
cost of electricity  greatly  influence  the location  of industrial  plants.
In industry,  the process  of purifying  a material  is known  as refining.
After the extraction  stage, some metals  are refined  in electrolytic  cells.
For example,  copper  is about 99% pure after extraction.  This copper
is pure enough  for some uses, such as the manufacture  of copper  pipes
for plumbing.  However,  the copper  is not pure enough  for one of its
principal  uses, electrical  wiring.  Therefore,  some of the impure  copper  is
refined  electrolytically,  as shown  in Figure 11.25. Nickel  can be refined
electrolytically  in a similar  way. You refined  copper  on a small scale in
Investigation  11-C.
GPTIEEEE 23 This electrolytic  cell is used to refine copper.  The anode is impure copper,
and the cathode  is pure copper.  During electrolysis,  the impure  copper  anode dissolves,  and
pure copper  is plated onto the cathode.  The resulting  cathode  is 99.99%  pure metal. Most
impurities  that were present  in the anode either remain in solution  or fall to the bottom  of
the cell as a sludge.

GETIEEEPT  Rust is a common  sight on iron objects.
Corrosion
Rusting  is an example  of corrosion,  which  is a spontaneous  redox
reaction  of materials  with substances  in their environment.  Figure 11.27
shows an example  of the hazards  that result from corrosion.
Many metals  are fairly easily oxidized.  The atmosphere  contains  a
powerful  oxidizing  agent: oxygen.  Because  metals  are constantly  in
contact  with oxygen,  they are vulnerable  to corrosion.  In fact, the term
“corrosion”  is sometimes  defined  as the oxidation  of metals  exposed
to the environment.  In North America,  about 20% to 25% of iron and
steel production  is used to replace  objects  that have been damaged  or
destroyed  by corrosion.  However,  not all corrosion  is harmful.  For
example,  the green layer formed  by the corrosion  of a copper  roof is
considered  attractive  by many people.
546 MHR- Unit 5 Electrochemistry
Rust is a hydrated  iron(II)  oxide, Fe203 ¢ xH2O. The electrochemical
formation  of rust occurs in small galvanic  cells on the surface  of a piece
of iron, as shown  in Figure 11.28. In each small cell, iron acts as the
anode. The cathode  is inert, and may be an impurity  that exists in the iron
or is deposited  onto it. For example,  the cathode  could be a piece of soot
that has been deposited  onto the iron surface  from the air.
Water, in the form of rain, is needed  for rusting  to occur. Carbon
dioxide  in the air dissolves  in water to form carbonic  acid, H2CO (aq) «
This weak acid partially  dissociates  into ions. Thus, the carbonic  acid is
an electrolyte  for the corrosion  process.  Other electrolytes,  such as road
salt, may also be involved.  The circuit  is completed  by the iron itself,
which  conducts  electrons  from the anode to the cathode.

The rusting of iron involves  the reaction  of iron, oxygen,  and water ina
naturally  occurring  galvanic  cell on the exposed  surface  of the metal.  There may be many
of these small cells on the surface  of the same piece of iron.
The rusting  process  is complex,  and the equations  may be written  in
various  ways. A simplified  description  of the half-reactions  and the
overall  cell reaction  is given here.
Oxidation  half-reaction  (occurs  at the anode):
Fe(s) > Fe?*ag) + 2€7
Reduction  half-reaction  (occurs  at the cathode):
Oa(g) + 2H20()  + 4€° > 40H (aq)
Multiply  the oxidation  half-reaction  by two and add the half-reactions
to obtain  the overall  cell reaction.
2Fe(s) + Ox) + 2H20(e)  > 2Fe**(aq) + 40H (aq)
There is no barrier  in the cell, so nothing  stops the dissolved  Fe** and
OH’ ions from mixing.  The iron(II)  ions produced  at the anode and the
hydroxide  ions produced  at the cathode  react to form a precipitate  of
iron(I)  hydroxide,  Fe(OH).  Therefore,  the overall  cell reaction  could
be written  as follows.
2Fe(s) + Oa) + 2H20(2) = 2Fe(OH)a(5)
The iron(II)  hydroxide  undergoes  further  oxidation  by reaction  with the
oxygen  in the air to form iron(II)  hydroxide.
4Fe(OH)a(5)  + O2(¢) + 2H20 (0) > 4Fe(OH)s(s)
Chapter  11 Cells and Batteries > MHR 547
Iron(IIJ)  hydroxide  readily  breaks  down to form hydrated  iron(II  oxide,
Fe,O3 ¢ xH,0,  more commonly  known  as rust. As noted earlier,  the “x
signifies  a variable  number  of water molecules  per formula  unit.
2Fe(OH)s(s)  > Fe2O3  ¢ 3H2045)
Both Fe(OH);  and Fe,O3 + xH,O are reddish-brown,  or “rust coloured.”
A rust deposit  may contain  a mixture  of these compounds.
Fortunately,  not all metals  corrode  to the same extent  as iron. Many
metals do corrode  in air to form a surface  coating  of metal oxide.
However,  in many cases, the oxide layer adheres,  or sticks firmly,  to the
metal surface.  This layer protects  the metal from further  corrosion.  For
example,  aluminum,  chromium,  and magnesium  are readily  oxidized  in
air to form their oxides,  Al,O3, Cr203,  and MgO. Unless  the oxide layer is
broken  by a cut or a scratch,  the layer prevents  further  corrosion.  In con-
trast, rust easily  flakes off from the surface  of an iron object and provides
little protection  against  further  corrosion.
Corrosion  Prevention
Corrosion,  and especially  the corrosion  of iron, can be very destructive.
For this reason,  a great deal of effort goes into corrosion  prevention.  The
simplest  method  of preventing  corrosion  is to paint an iron object. The
protective  coating  of paint prevents  air and water from reaching  the metal
surface.  Other effective  protective  layers include  grease,  oil, plastic,  or a
metal that is more resistant  to corrosion  than iron. For example,  a layer
of chromium  protects  bumpers  and metal trim on cars. An enamel  coating
is often used to protect  metal plates,  pots, and pans. Enamel  is a shiny,
hard, and very unreactive  type of glass that can be melted  onto a metal
surface.  A protective  layer is effective  as long as it completely  covers  the
iron object. If a hole or scratch  breaks  the layer, the metal underneath
can corrode.
It is also possible  to protect  iron against  corrosion  by forming  an alloy
with a different  metal. Stainless  steel is an alloy of iron that contains  at
least 10% chromium,  by mass, in addition  to small quantities  of carbon
and occasionally  metals  such as nickel. Stainless  steel is much more
resistant  to corrosion  than pure iron. Therefore,  stainless  steel is often
used for cutlery,  taps, and various  other applications  where rust-resistance
is important.  However,  chromium  is much more expensive  than iron. As
a result, stainless  steel is too expensive  for use in large-scale  applications,
such as building  bridges.
Galvanizing  is a process  in which  iron is covered  with a protective
layer of zinc. Galvanized  iron is often used to make metal buckets  and
chain-link  fences.  Galvanizing  protects  iron in two ways. First, the zinc
acts as a protective  layer. If this layer is broken,  the iron is exposed  to
air and water. When  this happens,  however,  the iron is still protected.
Zinc is more easily oxidized  than iron. Therefore,  zinc, not iron, becomes
the anode in the galvanic  cell. The zinc metal is oxidized  to zinc ions. In
this situation,  zinc is known  as a sacrificial  anode,  because  it is destroyed
(sacrificed)  to protect  the iron. Iron acts as the cathode  when zinc is pres-
ent. Thus, iron does not undergo  oxidation  until all the zinc has reacted.
548 MHR-« Unit 5 Electrochemistry
Cathodic  protection  is another  method  of preventing  rusting,  as
shown  in Figure 11.29. As in galvanizing,  a more reactive  metal is
attached  to the iron object. This reactive  metal acts as a sacrificial  anode,
and the iron becomes  the cathode  of a galvanic  cell. Unlike  galvanizing,
the metal used in cathodic  protection  does not completely  cover the iron.
Because  the sacrificial  anode is slowly  destroyed  by oxidation,  it must be
replaced  periodically.
If iron is covered  with a protective  layer of a metal that is less reactive
than iron, there can be unfortunate  results.  A “tin” can is actually  a steel
can coated  with a thin layer of tin. While the tin layer remains  intact, it
provides  effective  protection  against  rusting.  If the tin layer is broken  or
scratched,  however,  the iron in the steel corrodes  faster  in contact  with
the tin than the iron would  on its own. Since tin is less reactive  than
iron, tin acts as a cathode  in each galvanic  cell on the surface  of the can.
Therefore,  the tin provides  a large area of available  cathodes  for the small
galvanic  cells involved  in the rusting  process.  Iron acts as the anode of
each cell, which  is its normal  role when rusting.
Sometimes,  the rusting  of iron is promoted  accidentally.  For example,
by connecting  an iron pipe to a copper  pipe in a plumbing  system,  an
inexperienced  plumber  could accidentally  speed up the corrosion  of the
iron pipe. Copper  is less reactive  than iron. Therefore,  copper  acts as the
cathode  and iron as the anode in numerous  small galvanic  cells at the
intersection  of the two pipes.
Build on your understanding  of corrosion  by completing  the following
practice  problems.
25. (a) Use the two half-reactions  for the rusting  process,  and  a table
of standard  reduction  potentials.  Determine  the standard  cell
potential  for this reaction.
(b) Do you think that your calculated  value is the actual cell potential
for each of the small galvanic  cells on the surface  of a rusting  iron
object?  Explain.
26. Explain  why aluminum  provides  cathodic  protection  to an iron
object.
27. In the year 2000, Transport  Canada  reported  that thousands  of cars
sold in the Atlantic  Provinces  between  1989 and 1999 had corroded
engine  cradle mounts.  Failure  of these mounts  can cause the steering
shaft to separate  from the car. The manufacturer  recalled  the cars
so that repairs  could be made, where necessary.  The same cars
were sold across the country.  Why do you think that the corrosion
problems  showed  up in the Atlantic  Provinces?
28. (a) Use a table of standard  reduction  potentials  to determine  whether
elemental  oxygen,  Oz), is a better oxidizing  agent under acidic
conditions  or basic conditions.
(b) From your answer  to part (a), do you think that acid rain promotes
or helps prevent  the rusting  of iron?GETEEEES)  Magnesium,  zinc,
or aluminum  blocks  are attached  to
ships’ hulls, oil and gas pipelines,

anode.
Chapter  11 Cells and Batteries  * MHR 549
GPTIEEEES)  Many electric  cars
are currently  under development.
In fact, the idea of electric  cars is
not new. In the early days of the
automobile,  electric  cars were more
common  than gasoline-powered
cars. The production  of electric  cars
peaked  in 1912, but then completely
stopped  in the 1930s.Automobile  Engines
The internal  combustion  engine  found in most automobiles  uses
gasoline  as a fuel. Unfortunately,  this type of engine  produces  pollutants,
such as carbon  dioxide  (CO2), nitrogen  oxides (NO,), and volatile
organic  compounds  (VOCs).  These pollutants  contribute  to health  and
environmental  problems,  such as smog and the greenhouse  effect. In
addition,  the internal  combustion  engine  is very inefficient.  It converts
only about 25% of the chemical  energy  of the fuel into the kinetic
energy  of the car. Electric  cars, such as those shown  in Figure 11.30,
may provide  a more efficient  and less harmful  alternative.
Manufacturers  and researchers  have attempted  to power
electric  cars with rechargeable  batteries,  such as modified  lead-acid
and nickel-cadmium  batteries.  However,  rechargeable  batteries  run
down fairly quickly.  The distance  driven  before recharging  a battery
may be 250 km or less. The battery  must then be recharged  from an
external  electrical  source.  Recharging  the lead-acid  battery  of an electric
car takes several  hours. Cars based on a version  of the nickel-cadmium
battery  can be recharged  in only fifteen  minutes.  However,  recharging
the batteries  of an electric  car is still inconvenient.
A new type of power  supply  for electric  cars eliminates  the need for
recharging.  A fuel cell is a battery  that produces  electricity  while reactants
are supplied  continuously  from an external  source.  Because  reactants
continuously  flow into the cell, a fuel cell is also known  as a flow battery.
Unlike  the fuel supply  of a more conventional  battery,  the fuel supply  in a
fuel cell is unlimited.  As in the combustion  of gasoline  in a conventional
engine,  the overall  reaction  in a fuel cell is the oxidation  of a fuel by oxygen.
The space shuttle  uses a fuel cell as a source of energy.  This cell
depends  on the oxidation  of hydrogen  by oxygen  to form water. The
fuel cell operates  under  basic conditions,  so it is sometimes  referred  to
as an alkaline  fuel cell. Figure 11.31, on the next page, shows  the design
of the cell. The half-reactions  and the overall  reaction  are as follows.
Reduction  (occurs  at the cathode):  Oz) + 2H20(e)  + 4e7 > 40H (aq)
Oxidation  (occurs  at the anode):  Hag) + 20H (aq) > 2H20e)  + 2e7
Multiply  the oxidation  half-reaction  by 2, add the two half-reactions,  and
simplify  to obtain  the overall  cell reaction.
2Hog) + Ox) > 2H2O0 ie)
Notice  that the overall  equation  is the same as the equation  for the
combustion  of hydrogen.  The combustion  of hydrogen  is an exothermic
reaction.  In the fuel cell, this reaction  produces  energy  in the form of
electricity,  rather than heat.

GETTEEEEES]  In an alkaline  fuel cell, the half-reactions  do not include  solid conductors  of
electrons.  Therefore,  the cell has two inert electrodes.
The hydrogen  fuel cell produces  water vapour,  which  does not contribute
to smog formation  or to the greenhouse  effect. This product  makes  the
hydrogen  fuel cell an attractive  energy  source  for cars. Also, the hydrogen
fuel cell is much more efficient  than the internal  combustion  engine.  A
hydrogen  fuel cell converts  about 80% of the chemical  energy  of the fuel
into the kinetic  energy  of the car.
There is a possible  problem  with the hydrogen  fuel cell. The cell
requires  hydrogen  fuel. Unfortunately,  uncombined  hydrogen  is not found
naturally  on Earth. Most hydrogen  is produced  from hydrocarbon  fuels,
such as petroleum  or methane.  These manufacturing  processes  may
contribute  significantly  to pollution  problems.  However,  hydrogen  can
also be produced  by the electrolysis  of water. If a source such as solar
energy  or hydroelectricity  is used to power  the electrolysis,  the overall
quantity  of pollution  is low.
The following  practice  problems  will allow you to test your
understanding  of fuel cells.
29. Calculate  E’cen for a hydrogen  fuel cell.
30. In one type of fuel cell, methane  is oxidized  by oxygen  to form
carbon  dioxide  and water.
(a) Write the equation  for the overall  cell reaction.
(b) Write the two half-reactions,  assuming  acidic conditions.
31. Reactions  that occur in fuel cells can be thought  of as being
“flameless  combustion  reactions.”  Explain  why.
32. If a hydrogen  fuel cell produces  an electric  current  of 0.600 A for
120 min, what mass of hydrogen  is consumed  by the cell?

Canadians  } in Chemistry
Dr. Viola Birss
As a science  student,  Viola Birss decided  to focus
on chemistry.  “I have always  had a concern  for
the environment,”  she says. “| am particularly
interested  in identifying  new, non-polluting  ways
of converting,  storing,  and using energy.”  Dr. Birss’s
interest  in non-polluting  energy  narrowed  her field
of interest  to electrochemistry.
Today, Dr. Birss is a chemistry  professor  at the
University  of Calgary.  Her research  focuses  on
developing  films to coat metal surfaces.  Among
other uses, these films can serve as protective
barriers  against  corrosion,  and as catalysts  in
fuel cells.Magnesium  alloys are very lightweight,  and are
being used in the aerospace  industry.  Because  they
are very reactive,  these alloys need to be protected
from corrosion.  Dr. Birss holds a patent on a new
approach  to the electrochemical  formation  of protec-
tive oxide films on magnesium  alloys. Dr. Birss also
works on developing  new catalysts  for fuel cells,
and studies  the factors  that lead to the breakdown
of fuel cells.
After finishing  an undergraduate  degree  at the
University  of Calgary,  Dr. Birss went on to complete
her doctoral  degree  as a Commonwealth  Scholar  at
the University  of Auckland  in New Zealand.  During
her postdoctoral  studies  at the University  of Ottawa,
she worked  with Dr. Brian Conway,  a famous
Canadian  electrochemist.  Dr. Conway's  work in
electrochemistry  has led to progress  in a range of
electrochemical  devices  including  fuel cells,
advanced  batteries,  and electrolytic  cells.
Dr. Birss takes pride in her team of undergradu-
ate, graduate,  and post-doctoral  students.  She works
hard to provide  a creative  and inspiring  environment
for them. Together,  they go on wilderness  hiking
and cross country  ski trips. In addition  to creating
a sense of community  within her team, Birss feels
that sports and nature help to recharge  her internal
“battery.”  Dr. Birss comments,  “These  activities
seem to provide  me with mental  and physical  rest,
so that my creativity  and energy  are catalyzed.”
Water  Treatment  and the Chlor-Alkali  Process
In many countries,  water is not safe to drink. Untreated  water is
sometimes  polluted  with toxic chemicals.  It may also carry numerous
water-borne  diseases,  including  typhoid  fever, cholera,  and dysentery.
In Canada,  the water that comes through  your tap has been through  an
elaborate  purification  process.  This process  is designed  to remove  solid
particles  and toxic chemicals,  and to reduce  the number  of bacteria
to safe levels. Adding  chlorine  to water is the most common  way to
destroy  bacteria.
You have already  seen that chlorine  gas can be made by the
electrolysis  of molten  sodium  chloride.  In industry,  some chlorine  is
produced  in this way using the Downs  cell described  earlier.  However,
more chlorine  is produced  in Canada  using a different  method,  called
the chlor-alkali  process.  In this process,  brine is electrolyzed  in a cell
like the one shown  in Figure 11.32. Brine is a saturated  solution  of
sodium  chloride.

GPTTEAEEE?]  The chlor-alkali  cell in this diagram  electrolyzes  an aqueous  solution  of
sodium  chloride  to produce  chlorine  gas, hydrogen  gas, and aqueous  sodium  hydroxide.
The asbestos  diaphragm  stops the chlorine  gas produced  at the anode  from mixing  with the
hydrogen  gas produced  at the cathode.  Sodium  hydroxide  solution  is removed  from the cell
periodically,  and fresh brine is added to the cell.
The half-reactions  and the overall  cell reaction  in the chlor-alkali  process
are as follows.
Oxidation:  2Cl (ag) > Cla) + 2e7
Reduction:  2H20(e)  + 2e7 > Hyg) + 20H (aq)
Overall:  2CI (aq) + 2H20(e) > Clay) + Hag) + 20H (aq)
Note that the sodium  ion is a spectator  ion, and does not take part in this
reaction.  However,  it combines  with OH to produce  sodium  hydroxide,
as shown  by the balanced  chemical  equation  below.
2NaCliaq)  + 2H20(¢)  > Clip) + Hog) + 2NaOH aq)
The products  of the chlor-alkali  process  are all useful. Sodium  hydroxide
is used to make soaps and detergents.  It is widely  used as a base in many
other industrial  chemical  reactions,  as well. The hydrogen  produced  by
the chlor-alkali  process  is used as a fuel. Chlorine  has many uses besides
water treatment.  For example,  chlorine  is used as a bleach  in the pulp and
paper industry.  Chlorine  is also used in the manufacture  of chlorinated
organic  compounds,  such as the common  plastic  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC).
The chlorination  of water is usually  carried  out by adding  chlorine
gas, sodium  hypochlorite,  or calcium  hypochlorite  to the water in low
concentrations.  The active antibacterial  agent in each case is hypochlorous
acid, HClO,).  For example,  when chlorine  gas is added  to water,
hypochlorous  acid is formed  by the following  reaction.
Clip) + H20 we) -> HCO (aq) + HCl(agq)
Some people  object to the chlorination  of water, and prefer to drink
bottled  spring  water. There is controversy  over the level of risk associated
with chlorination,  and over the possible  benefits  of spring  water. For
example,  hypochlorous  acid reacts with traces of organic  materials  in
the water supply.  These reactions  can produce  toxic substances,  such as
chloroform.  Supporters  of chlorination  believe  that these substances  are
present  at very low, safe levels,  but opponents  of chlorination  disagree.
Complete  the following  practice  problems  to help you decide  on your
own opinion  of chlorination.

33. Show that the reaction  of chlorine  gas with water is a
disproportionation  reaction.
34. Would  you predict  the products  of the chlor-alkali  process  to be
hydrogen  and chlorine?  Explain.

Investigation
Electroplating
Background
The most beautiful  metals,  such as silver and
gold, can also be the most expensive.
Unfortunately,  pure gold is soft, and pure silver
tarnishes  quickly.
Electroplating  is a common  method  used to
produce  beautiful  and durable  metal objects.
Jewellery  and other metal objects  can be made
cheaper,  stronger,  and more durable  by coating  a
strong, cheaper  metal with a thin layer of a more
expensive  metal. For example,  cheaper  jewellery
can be made from copper  or nickel,  and then
coated  with silver. More expensive  jewellery  can
be made from silver, and then coated  with gold.
Industry  also uses electroplating  for many
applications.  Chromium,  an extremely  hard
surface  metal, is commonly  electroplated  over
steel cores for heavy duty applications.  Worn or
damaged  metal machine  parts may be restored  by
re-plating  the worn sections.
The bumper  of this car is plated with chromium.

Making  Connections
43, Black-and-white  photographic  film contains
silver bromide.  When exposed  to light, silver
bromide  decomposes  in a redox reaction.  Silver
ions are reduced  to silver metal, and bromide
ions are oxidized  to bromine  atoms. The
brighter  the light that hits the film, the greater
is the decomposition.  When the film is
developed,  the parts of the film that contain
the most silver metal produce  the darkest
regions  on the negative.  In other words,  the
brightest  parts of the photographed  scene give
the darkest  parts of the image on the negative.
High-speed  black-and-white  film uses silver
iodide in place of silver bromide.  Do you think
that silver iodide is more sensitive  or less
sensitive  to light than silver bromide?  Explain.44. The two rocket  booster  engines  used in a

The Chemistry  of Human Health
I, is tempting to think of science as a clearly
defined  set of disciplines,  such as chemistry,
physics,  and biology.  This is not wholly  accurate,
however.  Scientific  disciplines  blend and overlap.
Therefore,  scientists  need to know what is hap-
pening  in relevant  areas of different  disciplines.
For example,  if you are studying  physics,  you
have probably  noticed  that both chemists  and
physicists  contributed  to the development  of
the atomic  theory.  The physicists  built on the
discoveries  of the chemists,  and vice versa.
The health  sciences  are a group of disciplines
that draw upon chemistry,  physics,  and biology.
How does chemistry  relate to the health sciences?
Knowing  about molecular  structure  and function
allows  biochemists  to synthesize  medicinal  com-
pounds  on  a large scale, and even to design  new
molecules  to fight diseases  and their symptoms.
Understanding  the chemical  role of nutrients,
vitamins,  and minerals  in the body helps
564 MHR - Course  Challengedieticians  develop  healthy  dietary  guidelines.
Knowing  the properties  of materials  helps
researchers  develop  new materials  and devices—
such as titanium  joints, plastic  heart valves,  and
artificial  skin—to  repair,  maintain,  and replace
parts of the human  body.
The developments  just described,  and many
others,  are possible  because  health  scientists
and chemists  communicate  by writing  books,
journal  articles,  and letters.  They use the Internet
to post results  and hold discussions.  They also
communicate  face-to-face  by giving presentations
and lectures,  and by chatting  over coffee. A
scientific  conference  is the perfect  place for such
face-to-face  interactions.
In this Course  Challenge,  you will investigate
different  facets of the intersection  of chemistry
with the health  sciences.  Then you will share your
findings  and learn from your peers in a conference
about the chemistry  of human  health.
Part 1: The Citric Acid Cycle
Metabolism  is a complex  series of interdependent  organic  reactions  that
power  the body by breaking  down food molecules  to provide  energy.  An
important  part of human  metabolism  is the breakdown  of glucose  to pro-
vide energy  for the body. First, a metabolic  process  called  glycolysis
breaks down glucose  into two molecules  of pyruvate,  C3;3H,O3.  The
pyruvate  molecules  then react with a chemical  species  called coenzyme
A, CoA, to form acetyl CoA. Acetyl  CoA reacts with oxaloacetic  acid
to begin the metabolic  cycle called the citric acid cycle, shown  in the
diagram  below. The citric acid cycle is also called the Krebs cycle, after its
discoverer,  Hans Krebs.Part 1 draws upon the skills and
concepts  you learned  in Unit 1.
You will use your understanding
of organic  molecules  and their
reactions  to analyze  a metabolic
cycle.

Think  and Research
1 ) Ketoacidosis  is a dangerous  condition  that is characterized  by the
acidification  of the blood and an acetone  odour on the breath.  The
condition  occurs when levels of oxaloacetic  acid for the citric acid
cycle are low. This leads to a buildup  of acetyl CoA molecules,
which  the liver metabolizes  to produce  acidic ketone  bodies.  Since
carbohydrates  are the main source of oxaloacetic  acid in the body,
high-protein,  low-carbohydrate  diets have been linked to ketoacidosis.
(a) Why do people follow  these diets? Do you think the benefits  of these
diets justify  the risks?
(b) Research  the connections  between  the citric acid cycle, ketoacidosis,
and high-protein,  low-carbohydrate  diets. Present  your findings  as a
web page or poster.
Part 2: Materials  for Replacing  Human Body Parts
Science  has come a long way since wooden  “pegs” were used to replace
lost legs. Prosthetics  are now made of lightweight,  long-lasting  materials.
Engineers  have developed  replacement  joints that function  in much the
same way as the original  human  joints. Understanding  the properties  of
materials  is key to developing  prosthetics  that function  well with living
human  bodies,  are relatively  comfortable,  and last a long time.
Challenge

following  questions  to guide you.
1) Titanium  is a metal that is often used in joint and bone
replacement.
(a) Write the electron  configuration  of titanium.
(b) What are some properties  of titanium?
(c) Why is titanium  a suitable  metal for replacing  human  joints and
bones?
(d) A titanium  alloy, rather  than pure titanium,  is often used as the
material  for replacement  joints and bones. Suggest  a reason  why
an alloy is used.
© @ Build a replacement  joint or bone out of household  materials.
Create an information  kit that explains  why you chose the materials
you did. For example,  you will want to describe  each material’s
reactivity,  strength,  and density,  as well as other properties.  Describe
any problems  you foresee  with your replacement  part. Will it react
with fluids in the body? Will it wear out quickly?  (Instead  of building  a
replacement  bone or joint, you may choose  to create a prosthetic  limb.)

Part 3: The Enzyme  Catalase
Enzymes  control  the rate of nearly  every reaction  in your body. They are
absolutely  essential  for the efficient  functioning  of the chemical  processes
that take place continuously  and keep the human  body alive and healthy.

1 ) Hydrogen  peroxide  is often used to sterilize  wounds.  The fizzing
that occurs is caused  by catalase  in the blood acting on the hydrogen
peroxide.  Bacteria  that do not have catalase  to disable  the hydrogen
peroxide  are killed by this chemical.  Humans  are protected  by the
presence  of catalase.  Not all bacteria  are killed by hydrogen  peroxide,
however,  because  some bacteria  do have catalase.

are catalase-negative.  Propose  safe ways to guard against  both types.
Part 4: Blood and Le Chatelier’s  Principle
In Unit 4, you learned  that buffers  resist changes  in pH. Buffer systems  are
extremely  important  to human  health,  since many of the life-sustaining
reactions  in the body depend  on a narrow  pH range to proceed  effectively.
The principal  buffer system  in blood serum is based on the equilibri-
um between  carbonic  acid, HzCO4(aq),  and the hydrogen  carbonate  ion,
HCO;-.  Carbonic  acid is unstable,  however.  It is also in equilibrium  with
carbon  dioxide.  Therefore,  a second  equilibrium  reaction  is involved  in
the hydrogen  carbonate  buffer system  in the blood: the reaction  between
carbon  dioxide  and water to produce  carbonic  acid, and its reverse.  The
two equilibrium  reactions  are summarized  below.
CO 2(aq) + 2H20 ie) = H2CO3  (aq) + H,0e) = HCO3 (aq) + H30" (aq)
Challenge
Refer to the description  of the hydrogen  carbonate  buffer system  in blood
serum to answer  questions  1 and 2. Then use questions  3 and 4 to design
an investigation  to find out how a buffer system  resists changes  in pH.
1) One of the differences  between  a buffer system  in the body and a
simple buffer system  in a lab is that the body can enhance  the buffer’s
power to resist pH changes.  For example,  the lungs regulate  the amount
of carbon  dioxide  that enters and leaves the body. The kidneys  help
to regulate  the pH of blood in several  ways, such as increasing  or
decreasing  excretion  of hydronium  ions, H;O*, in urine. Explain  how
the kidneys  might respond  to the following  conditions.
(a) The blood pH rises to 7.48.
(b) The blood pH sinks to 7.33.
© @ Healthy  blood has a pH of 7.4. Estimate  the ratio of [CO2] to
[HCO;"]  in the blood. Use the following  assumptions  and information
to help you.
e Assume  that carbonic  acid and hydrogen  carbonate  ions are the only
contributors  to blood pH.
e Use K, = 4.3 x 10°’ for H,CO3.
e To express  your answer  in terms of CO2, assume  that all
undissociated  carbonic  acid is present  as dissolved  CO;.
© @ Because  blood is buffered,  it resists changes  in pH. To model
blood’s  resistance  to changes  in pH, design an investigation  that
compares  the effects of adding  an acid or a base to buffered  and
non-buffered  systems.  Your teacher  will tell you what materials  you
may use. The following  tips and suggestions  will help you get started.
e You can prepare  a simple  buffer system  by mixing  equal volumes
of 0.1 mol/L acetic acid, CH;COOH,  and 0.1 mol/L sodium  acetate,
NaCH;COO.  Alternatively,  you may wish to try more closely
simulating  the buffer system  in blood. Use soda water, which
contains  dissolved  CO2, and sodium  hydrogen  carbonate  (baking
soda), NaHCO3.  Your teacher  may suggest  other buffer systems.
e Consider  carrying  out your investigation  on the microscale.
e You will need to decide  how to monitor  pH changes.  You may
choose  to use a pH meter or a universal  indicator,  for example.
e Decide  what type and concentration  of acid and base you will add to
your systems.  Dilute solutions  of strong acids and bases work well.
e Include  a step in which you determine  the initial pH of your buffer
solution  and the unbuffered  system.
e Include  all appropriate  safety precautions.
Obtain  your teacher’s  approval  for your procedure,  and carry out your
investigation.
© @ Prepare  a detailed  report to communicate  your findings.  Be sure to
compare  and contrast  the system  you used in your investigation  with
the carbonic  acid/carbonate  buffer system  in the blood. How are the
systems  similar?  How are they different?

Part 5 draws upon the skills and
concepts  you learned  in Unit 5.
You will use your understanding
of redox reactions  to design a
titration  for vitamin C, an
antioxidant.
Often, to make the endpoint
of an iodine titration  more
obvious,  an indicator  solution
that contains  starch is added
to the solution  being titrated.
Starch forms a deep blue com-
plex with triiodide,  Iz, but it is
colourless  with I-. As long as
there is unreacted  vitamin  C in
solution,  no triiodide  ions will
be present  in solution.
Therefore,  the blue colour  will
appear  only at the endpoint.

1) Respiratory  acidosis  occurs when someone  has difficulty
breathing,  as in an asthma  attack, or when someone  is in an area
with insufficient  ventilation.  Symptoms  of acidosis  include  fainting
and depression  of the nervous  system.
(a) Based on the name of the condition,  what do you think happens  to
the pH of the blood in respiratory  acidosis?
(b) Explain  why insufficient  ventilation  or breathing  difficulties  lead to
respiratory  acidosis.  Refer to the carbonic  acid/hydrogen  carbonate
buffer system  in your answer.
(c) To help maintain  the pH of the blood, the kidneys  can increase
or decrease  reabsorption  of HCO;  into the blood. They can also
decrease  or increase  the excretion  of H;0* ions. How would the
kidneys  respond  to respiratory  acidosis?  Explain  your answer.
(d) Suggest  ways that you could help someone  who was suffering  from
respiratory  acidosis  as a result of having  been in an area with
insufficient  ventilation.
Part 5: Vitamin  C—An Important  Antioxidant
Oxygen  and other oxidizing  agents can react harmfully  with your body.
Vitamin  C acts as an antioxidant.  It is very easily oxidized,  so it reacts
with oxidizing  agents,  preventing  them from reacting  with other
important  molecules  in the body. Vitamin  C is relatively  stable when
it is oxidized.  Therefore,  it does not propagate  a harmful  series of oxida-
tion reactions.  The Chemistry  Bulletin  in Unit 5 explains  the possible
connection  between  oxidizing  agents and aging.
One way to determine  the vitamin  C content  of a sample  is to titrate
it with an iodine/iodide  solution.  The diagram  below shows the reaction
involved.

In the iodine solution,  iodine,  Iz, and iodide,  I’, ions are in equilibrium
with triiodide,  as shown  below.
L+F0=  I37
Molecular  iodine is a deep violet-red  colour. Iodine ions are colourless.
Thus, when an antioxidant  reduces  the iodine molecules  in a solution,  the
iodine colour  disappears  completely.
Challenge
In this Challenge,  you will design  a titration  to compare  the vitamin  C
content  of various  samples.  Your teacher  will tell you what reactants  are
available  for you to use in your titration.
@ @ Iodine solutions  may be used to titrate solutions  that contain
antioxidants,  such as vitamin  C.
(a) In storage,  the concentration  of iodine in solution  decreases  fairly
quickly  over time. Why do you think this happens?
(b) Because  the iodine solution’s  concentration  is not stable, it should  be
standardized  frequently.  To standardize  an iodine solution,  use it to
titrate a solution  that contains  a known  quantity  of vitamin  C. Then
determine  what volume  of iodine solution  is needed  to react with
the known  quantity  of vitamin  C. Explain  how you would stand-
ardize a solution  of iodine using vitamin  C tablets from a pharmacy.
(c) To standardize  iodine using vitamin  C tablets,  you should  use fresh
tablets.  Explain  why.
© @ Design  a titration  that uses an iodine solution  to determine  and
compare  the concentration  of vitamin  C in a variety  of fresh fruit
juices. You may find it helpful  to research  appropriate  procedures  on
the Internet.  Include  a method  for standardizing  the iodine solution.
(See Challenge  question  1.) Make sure that you list all the safety
precautions  you will use in your titration.  Check  your procedure
with your teacher,  and then carry out your titration.
© @ Prepare  a detailed  report to communicate  your results. Include  the
half-reaction  for iodine in your discussion  of the titration.
4) If you titrate orange juice that has been exposed  to the air for
a week, will the vitamin  C concentration  be different  from the vitamin
C concentration  in fresh juice? If so, will it decrease  or increase?
Explain  your prediction,  in terms of redox reactions.
© @ If time permits,  extend your investigation  to compare  the vitamin  C
content  of fresh juice and juice that has been left exposed  to air for
varying  periods  of time. Ask your teacher  to approve  your procedure
before carrying  out this extension.

a vitamin  C tablet. The iodine solution  quickly  becomes  colourless.
Then the chemist  adds a solution  that contains  chlorine,  Cl,. The

Additional  Topics
What other health-related  challenges  has chemistry  helped  scientists  to
understand  or solve? You may wish to go beyond  the challenges  listed in
Parts 1 to 5 of the Course  Challenge  and investigate  other areas of human
health.  Some suggestions  are listed below.
Unit 1
e Researchers  can use computer  programs  to test the geometry  of many
molecular  structures  and determine  their suitability  for specific  applica-
tions. For example,  a specialized  screen  saver can check  the shape of
hypothetical  molecules  based on their suitability  for cancer  treatment.
Anyone  can upload  the screen  saver and use a computer’s  idle time
to test molecules.  Research  this method,  and write an article on the
success  of computer-assisted  research.
e Pyruvate  carboxylase  (also called  PC) is an enzyme  that converts
pyruvate  to oxaloacetate  (shown  as oxaloacetic  acid in the citric acid
cycle diagram).  Pyruvate  carboxylase  deficiency  is a genetic  disorder
that is characterized  by insufficient  quantities  of pyruvate  carboxylate  in
the body. How do you think this disorder  affects the citric acid cycle?
Use print and electronic  resources  to research  pyruvate  carboxylase
deficiency.  Find out what its symptoms  are, and how it affects  the body
at the molecular  level. Also find out what percent  of the population  is
affected,  and how the deficiency  can be relieved.  Present  your findings
as an informative  pamphlet.  If possible,  conduct  an e-mail interview
with an expert  on the disorder.
e Use print and electronic  resources  to study compounds  that have been
produced  as diet aids, such as aspartame  and olestra.  How do these
compounds  work? Are there drawbacks  or risks involved  in using these
compounds?  Choose  one compound,  and conduct  a risk-benefit  analysis.
Unit 2
e Watson  and Crick’s discovery  of the structure  of DNA revolutionized
scientists’  understanding  of heredity  and genetics.  Find out how Watson
and Crick showed  that the structure  of DNA is a double  helix. How did
Rosalind  Franklin’s  work in X-ray crystallography  play a role? Present
your findings  as an annotated,  illustrated  time line.
e It is relatively  straightforward  to extract  DNA from animal  matter.
Research  a procedure  on the Internet.  Obtain  your teacher’s  approval,
and then carry out the extraction.  Use the concept  of intermolecular
forces to explain  how the extraction  works.
Unit 3
e Human  disorders  and conditions  are sometimes  caused  by the lack
of an enzyme.  For example,  lactose  intolerance  is caused  by low
concentrations  of lactase,  an enzyme  that breaks  down lactose  (the
sugar in milk). Find out about lactose  intolerance  or another  condition
that is caused  by a missing  enzyme.  How are the conditions  diagnosed?
Have treatments  been developed?  How effective  are the treatments?
Who suffers  from the condition?  How harmful  is it?
e Researchers  have used a specially  designed  calorimeter,  called a human
calorimeter,  to monitor  the heat that is produced  by metabolic  reactions
in humans.  Research  the human  calorimeters  that are used to study
metabolic  reactions.  What are the design  features  of these calorimeters?
What factors  do researchers  need to take into account?  Why are the
experiments  with human  calorimeters  important?  Design  an investiga-
tion that incorporates  the results of your research.
Unit 4
e In Part 4 of the Course  Challenge,  you looked  at the carbonic  acid/
hydrogen  carbonate  buffer system  in the blood. Another  important
buffer system  in the body depends  on the equilibrium  between  dihydro-
gen phosphate,  H,PO, , and hydrogen  phosphate,  HPO,’~.  Use print and
electronic  resources  to learn where this buffer system  is found in the
body and how the body regulates  concentrations  of H,PO,”  and H2PO,?-.
e Acid indigestion,  also known  as “heartburn,”  is caused  by the excess
production  of stomach  acid. Eating a large meal may bring on acid
indigestion.  Commercial  antacids  contain  basic salts that neutralize  the
excess acids. Design  a titration  experiment  to test the effectiveness  of
various  brands  of antacids.
Unit 5
e Using only materials  that are available  in your school chemistry
laboratory,  design  a pacemaker  battery.  Find out what voltage  is appro-
priate for a pacemaker.  Be sure to outline  all design  considerations.
For example,  how large will the battery  need to be? How long will it
last? Have your teacher  approve  your design.  Then build your battery.
e Using print and electronic  resources,  research  the work of Wilson
Greatbatch,  the inventor  of the implantable  pacemaker.  What
chemistry-related  technological  challenges  did he face and overcome
as he perfected  his device?

Math and Chemistry
Significant  Digits
All measurements  involve  uncertainty.  One source
of this uncertainty  is the measuring  device  itself.
Another  source  is your ability  to perceive  and interpret
a reading.  In fact, you cannot  measure  anything  with
complete  certainty.  The last (farthest  right) digit in
any measurement  is always  an estimate.
The digits that you record  when you measure
something  are called significant  digits. Significant
digits include  the digits that you are certain  about,
and  a final, uncertain  digit that you estimate.  Follow
the rules below  to identify  the number  of significant
digits in a measurement.
Rules for Determining  Significant  Digits
Rule 1 All non-zero  numbers  are significant.
¢ 7.886 has four significant  digits.
e 19.4 has three significant  digits.
© 527.266  992 has nine significant  digits.
Rule 2 All zeros that are located  between  two non-zero
numbers  are significant.
e 408 has three significant  digits.
° 25 074 has five significant  digits.
Rule 3 Zeros that are located  to the left of a measure-
ment are not significant.
¢ 0.0907  has three significant  digits: the 9, the
third 0 to the right, and the 7.
Rule 4 Zeros that are located  to the right of a measure-
ment may or may not be significant.
e 22 700 may have three significant  digits, if the
measurement  is approximate.
e 22 700 may have five significant  digits, if the
measurement  is taken carefully.
When you take measurements  and use them to calculate
other quantities,  you must be careful  to keep track of
which digits in your calculations  and results  are signifi-
cant. Why? Your results  should  not imply  more certainty
than your measured  quantities  justify. This is especially
important  when you use a calculator.  Calculators  usually
report  results  with far more digits than your data warrant.
Always  remember  that calculators  do not make decisions
about certainty.  You do. Follow  the rules given below  to
report  significant  digits in a calculated  answer.
Rules for Reporting  Significant  Digits in
Calculations
Rule 1 Multiplying  and Dividing
The value with the fewest  number  of significant
digits, going into a calculation,  determines  the
number  of significant  digits that you should
report  in your answer.
590 =MHR« Appendix  DRule 2 Adding  and Subtracting
The value with the fewest  number  of decimal
places,  going into a calculation,  determines  the
number  of decimal  places  that you should  report
in your answer.
Rule3 Rounding
To get the appropriate  number  of significant
digits (rule 1) or decimal  places (rule 2), you
may need to round  your answer.
e If your answer  ends in a number  that is greater
than 5, increase  the preceding  digit by 1. For
example,  2.346 can be rounded  to 2.35.
e If your answer  ends with a number  that is less
than 5, leave the preceding  number  unchanged.
For example,  5.73 can be rounded  to 5.7.
e If your answer  ends with 5, increase  the

Using Significant  Digits
Problem
Suppose  that you measure  the masses  of four
objects  as 12.5 g, 145.67  g, 79.0 g, and 38.438  g.
What is the total mass?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate  the total mass of the objects.
What Is Given?
You know the mass of each object.
Plan Your Strategy
¢ Add the masses  together,  aligning  them at the
decimal  point.
¢ Underline  the estimated  (farthest  right) digit in
each value. This is a technique  you can use to
help you keep track of the number  of estimated
digits in your final answer.
e In the question,  two values  have the fewest
decimal  places: 12.5 and 79.0. You need to
round your answer  so that it has only one
decimal  place.
Act on Your Strategy

Scientific  Notation
One mole of water, H.O, contains
602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000 molecules.
Each molecule  has a mass of
0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9 g. As you can see,
it would  be very awkward  to calculate  the mass of one
mole of water using these values.  To simplify  large
numbers  when reporting  them and doing calculations,
you can use scientific  notation.
Step 1 Move the decimal  point so that only one
non-zero  digit is in front of the decimal  point.
(Note that this number  is now between  1.0 and
9.99999999.)  Count  the number  of places  that the
decimal  point moves  to the left or to the right.
Step 2 Multiply  the value by a power  of 10. Use the
number  of places  that the decimal  point moved
as the exponent  for the power  of 10. If the deci-
mal point moved  to the right, exponent  is nega-
tive. If the decimal  point moved  to the left, the
exponent  is positive.

Rules for Scientific  Notation
Rule 1 To multiply  two numbers  in scientific  notation,
add the exponents.
(7.32 x 107%) x (8.91 x 1077)
= (7.32 x 8.91) x 10(° +77)
= 65.2212  x 10°
— 6.52 x 107
Rule2 To divide  two numbers  in scientific  notation
subtract  the exponents.
(1.842 x 10°g) + (1.0787  x 10° g/mol)
= (1.842 + 1.0787)  x 10(°7)
= 1.707611  x 10*g
— 1.708 x 10*¢
Rule 3 To add or subtract  numbers  in scientific  notation,
first convert  the numbers  so they have the same
exponent.  Each number  should  have the same
exponent  as the number  with the greatest  power
of 10. Once the numbers  are all expressed  to the
same power  of 10, the power  of 10 is neither
added  nor subtracted  in the calculation.
(3.42 x 10° cm) + (8.53 x 10° cm)
= (3.42 x 10° cm) + (0.00853  x 10° cm)
= 3.42853  x 10°cm
— 3.43 x 10°cm
(9.93 x 10'L) — (7.86 x 107'L)

Logarithms
Logarithms  are a convenient  method  for communicating
large and small numbers.  The Jogarithm,  or “log,” of a
number  is the value of the exponent  that 10 would
have to be raised to, in order to equal this number.
Every positive  number  has a logarithm.  Numbers  that
are greater  than 1 have a positive  logarithm.  Numbers
that are between  0 and 1 have a negative  logarithm.
Table D1 gives some examples  of the logarithm  values
of numbers.

0.004 276 | 4.276 x 10° 1072-3699 —2.3690
Logarithms  are especially  useful for expressing  values
that span a range of powers  of 10. The Richter  scale for
earthquakes,  the decibel  scale for sound,  and the pH
scale for acids and bases all use logarithmic  scales.
Logarithms  and pH
The pH of an acid solution  is defined  as —log|H30"].
(The square  brackets  mean “concentration.”)  For
example,  suppose  that the hydronium  ion concentration
in a solution  is 0.0001 mol/L (10 mol/L).  The pH is
—log(0.0001).  To calculate  this, enter 0.0001 into your
calculator.  Then press the [LOG] key. Press the [+] key.
The answer  in the display  is 4. Therefore,  the pH of the
solution  is 4.
592.) MHR  © Appendix  DThere are logarithms  for all numbers,  not just whole
multiples  of 10. What is the pH of a solution  if
[H;0*| = 0.004 76 mol/L?  Enter 0.00476.  Press the
[LOG] key and then the [+] key. The answer  is 2.322.
This result has three significant  digits—the  same
number  of significant  digits as the concentration.
CONCEPT  CHECK
For logarithmic  values,  only the digits to the right of the
decimal  point count as significant  digits. The digit to the
left of the decimal  point fixes the location  of the decimal
point of the original  value.
\ y,
What if you want to find [H,0*] from the pH? You
would need to find 10-P#. For example,  what is [H3;0*]
if the pH is 5.78? Enter 5.78, and press the [+] key. Then
use the |[10*] function.  The answer  is 10~°-”8. Therefore,
[H;0+] is 1.7 x 107° mol/L.
Remember  that the pH scale is a negative  log scale.
Thus, a decrease  in pH from pH  7 to pH  4 is an increase
of 10°, or 1000, in the acidity  of a solution.  An increase
from pH 3 to pH6 is a decrease  of 10°, or 1000, in
acidity.

The Unit Analysis  Method  of Problem
Solving
The unit analysis  method  of problem  solving  is
extremely  versatile.  You can use it to convert  between
units or to solve some formula  problems.  If you forget a
formula  during  a test, you may still be able to solve the
problem  using unit analysis.
The unit analysis  method  involves  analyzing  the
units and setting  up conversion  factors.  You match
and arrange  the units so that they divide  out to give
the desired  unit in the answer.  Then you multiply
and divide  the numbers  that correspond  to the units.
Steps  for Solving  Problems  Using Unit
Analysis
Step 1 Determine  which  data you have and which
conversion  factors  you need to use. (A conver-
sion factor is usually  a ratio of two numbers
with units, such as 1000 g/1 kg. You multiply
the given data by the conversion  factor to get
the desired  units for the answer.)  It is often
convenient  to use the following  three categories
to set up your solution:  Have, Need, and
Conversion  factor.
Step 2 Arrange  the data and conversion  factors  so that
you can cross out the undesired  units. Decide
whether  you need any additional  conversion
factors  to get the desired  units for the answer.
Step 3 Multiply  all the numbers  on the top of the ratio.
Then multiply  all the numbers  on the bottom  of
the ratio. Divide  the top result by the bottom
result.
Step 4 Check  that you have cancelled  the units correct-
ly. Also check  that the answer  seems reasonable,
and that the significant  digits are correct.
CONCEPT  CHECK
Remember  that counting  numbers  for exact quantities  are
considered  to have infinite significant  digits. For example,
if you have 3 apples,  the number  is exact, and has an
infinite number  of significant  digits. Conversion  factors
for unit analysis  are a form of counting  or record keeping.
Therefore,  you do not need to consider  the number  of
significant  digits in conversion  factors,  such as 1000 mL/
1 L, when deciding  on the number  of significant  digits in
the answer.Active  ASA
Problem
In the past, pharmacists  measured  the active ingre-
dients  in many medications  in a unit called  grains

tablet contains  5.0 gr of active acetylsalicylic  acid
(ASA),  how many grams of ASA are in two tablets?

two tablets.
What Is Given?
There are 5.0 gr of ASA in one tablet. A conversion
factor for grains  to milligrams  is given.
Plan Your Strategy
Multiply  the given quantity  by conversion  factors
until all the unwanted  units cancel  out and only
the desired  units remain.

This is the least number  of significant  digits in the
given data.

until all the unwanted  units are cancelled  out,
leaving  only the desired  unit in the answer.

Titration  Guidelines
Rinsing  the Pipette
A pipette  is used to measure  and transfer  a precise
volume  of liquid. You rinse a pipette  with the solu-
tion whose  volume  you are measuring.  This ensures
that the solution  will not be diluted  or contaminated.
1. Pour a sample  of standard  solution  into a clean,
dry beaker.
2. Place the pipette  tip in a beaker  of distilled  water.
Squeeze  the suction  bulb. Maintain  your grip
while placing  it over the stem of the pipette.  Do
not insert the stem into the bulb. (If your suction
bulbs have valves,  your teacher  will show you
how to use them.)3. Relax your grip on the bulb to draw up a small vol-
ume of distilled  water.
4. Remove  the bulb, and discard  the water by letting it
drain out.
5. Rinse the pipette  by drawing  several  millilitres  of
solution  from the beaker  into it. Rotate  and rock the
pipette  to coat the inner surface  with solution.
Discard  the rinse. Rinse the pipette  twice in this
way. It is now ready to fill with standard  solution.
TITRATION  TIP
Never use your mouth instead  of a suction  bulb
to drawa liquid into a pipette.  The liquid could be
corrosive  or poisonous.  As well, you would contami-
nate the glass stem.
Filling  the Pipette
6. Place the tip of the pipette  below  the surface  of
the solution.
7. Hold the suction  bulb loosely  on the end of the
glass stem. Use the suction  bulb to draw liquid
up just past the etched  volume  mark. (See Figure
F.1.)
8. As quickly  and smoothly  as you can, slide the
bulb off and place your index finger over the end
of the glass stem.

it is to add more solution  to
the pipette.
TITRATION  TIP
Practice  removing  the bulb and replacing  it with
your index finger (or thumb).  You need to be able
to perform  this action quickly  and smoothly.9. Gently  roll your finger  slightly  away from end of
the stem to let solution  drain slowly  out.
10. When the bottom  of the meniscus  aligns  with the
etched  mark, as in Figure F.2, press your finger
back over the end of the stem. This will prevent
more solution  from draining  out.
11. Touch the tip of the pipette  to the side of the beaker
to remove  any clinging  drop. See Figure F.3. The
measured  volume  inside  the pipette  is now ready
to be transferred  to an Erlenmeyer  flask or a volu-
metric  flask.
| Figure F.3 | You can prevent  a
“stubborn”  drop from clinging  to
the pipette  tip by touching  the tip to
the inside of the glass surface.
600 =MHR  = Appendix  F
Adding  the Indicator
14. Add two or three drops of indicator  to the flaskTransferring  the Solution
12. Place the tip of the pipette  against  the inside
glass wall of the flask. Let the solution  drain
slowly,  by removing  your finger  from the stem.
13. After the solution  drains,  wait several  seconds
and then touch the tip to the inside wall of the
flask to remove  any drop on the end. Note: You
may notice a small amount  of liquid remaining  in
the tip. The pipette  was calibrated  to retain this
amount.  Do not try to remove  it.and its contents.  Do not add too much indicator.
Using more does not make the colour  change
easier  to see. Also, indicators  are usually  weak
acids. Too much can change  the amount  of base
needed  for neutralization.  You are now ready to
prepare  the apparatus  for the titration.
Rinsing  the Burette
A burette  is a graduated  glass tube with a tap at
one end. It is used to accurately  measure  the
volume  of liquid added during  a titration
experiment.
15. To rinse the burette,  close the tap and add about
10 mL of distilled  water  from a wash bottle.
16. Tip the burette  to one side, and roll it gently
back and forth so that the water comes  in
contact  with all inner surfaces.
TITRATION  TIP
If you are right-handed,  the tap should be on your
right as you face the burette.  Use your left hand to
operate  the tap. Use your right hand to swirl the
liquid in the Erlenmeyer  flask. If you are left-handed,
reverse  this arrangement.17.
18.Hold the burette  over a sink. Open the tap, and
let the water drain out. While you do this, check
that the tap does not leak. Make sure that it turns
smoothly  and easily.
Rinse the burette  with 5 mL to 10 mL of the solu-
tion that will be measured.  Remember  to open
the tap to rinse the lower portion  of the burette.
Rinse the burette  twice, discarding  the liquid
each time.
Filling  the Burette
19. Assemble  a retort stand and burette  clamp  to
hold the burette.  Place a funnel in the top of the
burette.
20. With the tap closed,  add solution  until the liquid
is above  the zero mark. Remove  the funnel.
Carefully  open the tap. Drain the liquid into a
beaker  until the bottom  of the meniscus  is at or
below  the zero mark.
21. Touch the tip of the burette  against  the beaker  to
remove  any clinging  drop. Check  that the portion
of the burette  that is below  the tap is filled with
liquid and contains  no air bubbles.22.
23.Record  the initial burette  reading  in your note-
book.
Replace  the beaker  with the Erlenmeyer  flask that
you prepared  earlier. Place a sheet of white paper
under  the Erlenmeyer  to help you see the indicator
colour  change  that will occur near the endpoint.
TITRATION  TIP
Near the endpoint,  when you see the indicator
change  colour as liquid enters  the flask from the
burette,  slow the addition  of liquid. The endpoint
can occur very quickly.
Reading  the Burette
24. A meniscus  reader  is a small white card with a thick
black line on it. Hold the card behind  the burette,
with the black line just under  the meniscus,  as in
Figure F.4. Record  the volume  added from the
burette  to the nearest  0.01 mL.
TITRATION  TIP
Observe  the level of solution  in the burette  so that
your eye is level with the bottom of the meniscus.GETEGZY  A meniscus
reader  helps you read the— volume  of liquid more easily

MHR ¢ Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Chemistry:  A Blend of Science  and Technology
Like all scientists,  chemists  try to describe  and explain  the world.
Chemists  start by asking  questions  such as these:
e Why is natural  gas such an effective  fuel?
e How can we separate  a mixture  of crude oil and water?
e Which  materials  dissolve  in water?
e What is rust and why does it form?
To answer  these questions,  chemists  develop  models,  conduct
experiments,  and seek patterns.  They observe  various  types of chemical
reactions,  and they perform  calculations  based on known  data. They build
continuously  on the work and the discoveries  of other scientists.
Long before humans  developed  a scientific  understanding  of the
world,  they invented  chemical  techniques  and processes.  These tech-
niques  and processes  included  smelting  and shaping  metals,  growing
crops, and making  medicines.  Early chemists  invented  technological
instruments,  such as glassware  and distillation  equipment.
Present-day  chemical  technologists  continue  to invent  new equipment.
They also invent  new or better  ways to provide  products  and services  that
people  want. Chemical  technologists  ask questions  such as the following:
e How can we redesign  this motor  to run on natural  gas?
e How can we contain  and clean up an oil spill?
e What methods  can we use, or develop,  to make water safe to drink?
e How can we prevent  iron objects  from rusting?
D Green plants use a chemical  process,  called photo-
synthesis,  to convert  water and carbon  dioxide  into
the food substances  they need to survive.  All the
foods that you eat depend  on this process.
E Your body uses chemical  processes  to break down
food and to release  energy.
F Your home is full of products  that are manufactured
by chemical  industries.  The products  that are shown
here are often used for cleaning.  Some of these
products,  such as bleach and drain cleaner,  can be
dangerous  if handled  improperly.

Eutrophication  is the process
in which excess  nutrients  in a
lake or river cause algae to
grow rapidly. Look up this term
in a reference  book or on the
Internet.  Is eutrophication
always caused by human
action?Chemistry,  Technology,  Society,  and the Environment
Today  we benefit  in many ways from chemical  understanding  and tech-
nologies.  Each benefit,  however,  has risks associated  with it. The risks and
benefits  of chemical  processes  and technologies  affect us either directly  or
indirectly.  Many people—either  on their own, in groups,  or through  their
elected  government  officials—assess  these risks and benefits.  They ask
questions  such as the following:
e Is it dangerous  to use natural  gas to heat my home?
e Why is the cost of gasoline  so high?
e Is my water really clean enough  to drink and use safely?
¢ How does rust degrade  machinery  over time?
During  your chemistry  course  this year, you will study the interactions
among  science,  technology,  society,  and the environment.  These interac-
tions are abbreviated  as STSE. Throughout  the textbook—in  examples,
practice  problems,  activities,  investigations,  and features—STSE  interac-
tions are discussed.  The issues that appear  at the end of some units are
especially  rich sources  for considering  STSE interactions.  In these simula-
tions, you are encouraged  to assess and make decisions  about important
issues that affect society  and the environment.
STSE Issue: Are Phosphates  Helpful  or Harmful?
Phosphorus  is an essential  nutrient  for life on Earth. Plants need
phosphorus,  along with other nutrients,  in order to grow. Phosphorus  is
a component  of bones and teeth. In addition,  phosphorus  is excreted  as
waste from the body. Thus, it is present  in human  sewage.
Since phosphorus  promotes  plant growth,  phosphates  are excellent
fertilizers  for crops. (Phosphates  are chemicals  containing  phosphorus.
You will learn more about phosphates  later in this unit.) Phosphates  are
also used as food additives,  and as components  in some medicines.  In
addition,  they are an important  part of dishwasher  and laundry  deter-
gents. For example,  sodium  tripolyphosphate  (STPP)  acts to soften  water,
and keep dirt suspended  in the water. Before  the 1970s, STPP was a major
ingredient  in most detergents.
Phosphates  Causing  Trouble
In the 1960s, residents  around  Lake Erie began to notice problems.  Thick
growths  of algae carpeted  the surface  of the water. Large amounts  of the
algae washed  onto beaches,  making  the beaches  unfit for swimming.  The
water in the lake looked  green, and had an unpleasant  odour. As time
passed,  certain  fish species  in Lake Erie began  to decrease.
In 1969, a joint Canadian  and American  task force pinpointed  the
source of the problem.  Phosphates  and other nutrients  were entering  the
lake, causing  algae to grow rapidly.  The algae then began to die and rot,
using up dissolved  oxygen  in the water. As a result, fish and other water
species  that needed  high levels of oxygen  were dying off.
The phosphate  pollution  arrived  in the lake from three main sources:
wastewater  containing  detergents,  sewage,  and run-off  from farms carrying
phosphate  fertilizers.  The task force recommended  reducing  the amount
of phosphate  in detergents.  They also suggested  removing  phosphorus  at
wastewater  treatment  plants before the treated  water entered  the lake.
Detergent  manufacturers  were upset by the proposed  reduction  in
phosphates.  Without  this chemical,  their detergents  would  be less effec-
MHR ¢ Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
tive. Also, it would  be expensive  to develop  other chemicals  to do the
same job. After pressure  from the government,  detergent  companies
reduced  the amount  of phosphate  in their products  by about 90%. Cities
on Lake Erie spent millions  of dollars  adding  phosphorus  removal  to their
waste treatment.  Today, Lake Erie has almost  completely  recovered.
The connection  between  technology  (human-made  chemical
products)  and the environment  (Lake Erie) is an obvious  STSE
connection  in this issue. What other connections  do you see?
Canadians  ' in Chemistry
John Charles  Polanyi  was born in Berlin,
Germany,  into a family  of Hungarian  origin.
Polanyi  was born on the eve of the Great
Depression,  shortly  before  the Nazi takeover.  His
father moved  to England  to become  a chemistry
professor  at Manchester  University.  Polanyi  was
sent to Canada  for safety during  the darkest  years
of World War Il.
John Polanyi  went back to England  to earn a
doctorate  in chemistry  at Manchester  University
in 1952. He returned  to Canada  a few years later.
Soon after, he took up a position  at the University
of Toronto.  There Dr. Polanyi  pursued  the
research  that earned  him a share of the Nobel
Prize for chemistry  in 1986. He pioneered  the field
of reaction  dynamics,  which addresses  one of the
most basic questions  in chemistry:  What happens
when two substances  interact  to produce  another
substance?  Polanyi’s  father had once investigated
the same question.
Dr. Polanyi  tried to provide  some answers  by
studying  the very faint light that is given off by
molecules  as they undergo  chemical  changes.
This light is invisible  to the unaided  eye, becauseit is emitted  in the infrared  range of energy.  It can
be detected,  however,  with the right instruments.
Dr. Polanyi’s  work led to the invention  of the laser.
As well, his research  helped  to explain  what
happens  to energy  during a chemical  reaction.
Dr. Polanyi  believes  that people  must accept
the responsibility  that comes  with scientific
understanding  and technological  progress.  He
believes,  as well, that a vital element  of hope
lies at the heart of modern  science.  To Dr. Polanyi,
human  rights are integral  to scientific  success.
“Science  must breathe  the oxygen  of freedom,”
he stated in 1999.
This is why Dr. Polanyi  says that scientists
must take part in the debate  on technological,
social,  and political  affairs. Dr. Polanyi  points
to the political  role played by scientists  such
as Andrei Sakharov  in the former  Soviet Union,
Linus Pauling  in the United States,  and Fang Lizhi
in China.
Make Connections
1. Research  the scientists  whom Dr. Polanyi
mentioned:  Andrei  Sakharov,  Linus Pauling,
and Fang Lizhi. What work distinguished  them
as scientists?  What work distinguished  them
as members  of society?
2. Throughout  history,  chemists  have laboured  to
present  the truth as they know it to their fellow
scientists  and to society.  Some of them, such
as Linus Pauling,  have been scorned  and
ridiculed  by the scientific  community.  Do fur-
ther research  to discover  two other chemists
who have struggled  to communicate  their
ideas, and have succeeded.

Describing  and Measuring  Matter
As you can see in the photograph  at the beginning  of this chapter,  water
is the most striking  feature  of our planet.  It is visible  from space, giving
Earth a vivid blue colour.  You can observe  water above,  below, and at
Earth’s  surface.  Water is a component  of every living thing, from the
smallest  bacterium  to the largest  mammal  and the oldest  tree. You drink
it, cook with it, wash with it, skate on it, and swim in it. Legends  and
stories  involving  water have been a part of every culture  in human
history.  No other kind of matter  is as essential  to life as water.
As refreshing  as it may be, water straight  from the tap seems rather
ordinary.  Try this: Describe  a glass of water to someone  who has never
seen or experienced  water before.  Be as detailed  as possible.  See how
well you can distinguish  water from other kinds of matter.
In addition  to water, there are millions  of different  kinds of matter  in the
universe.  The dust specks suspended  in the air, the air itself, your chair,
this textbook,  your pen, your classmates,  your teacher,  and you—all  these
are examples  of matter.  In the language  of science,  matter  is anything  that
has mass and volume  (takes up space).  In the rest of this chapter,  you will
examine  some key concepts  related  to matter.  You have encountered  these
concepts  in previous  studies.  Before  you continue,  complete  the Checkpoint
activity  to see what you recall and how well you recall it. As you proceed
through  this chapter,  assess and modify  your answers.
Describing  Matter
You must observe  matter  carefully  to describe  it well. When describing
water, for example,  you may have used statements  like these:
e Water is a liquid.
e It has no smell.
e Water is clear and colourless.
e It changes  to ice when it freezes.
e Water freezes  at 0°C.
e Sugar dissolves  in water.
e Oil floats on water.
Characteristics  that help you describe  and identify  matter  are called
properties.  Figure 1.2 on the next page shows some properties  of water
and hydrogen  peroxide.  Examples  of properties  include  physical  state,
colour,  odour, texture,  boiling  temperature,  density,  and flammability
(combustibility).  Table 1.2 on the next page lists some common  properties
of matter.  You will have direct experience  with most of these properties
during  this chemistry  course.1.2

GETEEEP?A  Liquid water is
clear, colourless,  odourless,  and
transparent.  Hydrogen  peroxide
(an antiseptic  liquid that many
people use to clean wounds)  has
the same properties.  It differs
from water, however,  in other
properties,  such as boiling  point,
density,  and reactivity  with acids.Table 1.2 Common  Properties  of Matter

odour density reactivity  with pure oxygen
crystal  shape solubility reactivity  with acids
malleability electrical  conductivity  | reactivity  with pure substances
ductility thermal  conductivity combustibility  (flammability)
hardness toxicity
brittleness decomposition
Properties  may be physical  or chemical.  A physical  property  is a property
that you can observe  without  changing  one kind of matter  into something
new. For example,  iron is a strong metal with a shiny surface.  It is solid at
room temperature,  but it can be heated  and formed  into different  shapes.
These properties  can all be observed  without  changing  iron into some-
thing new.
A chemical  property  is a property  that you can observe  when one
kind of matter  is converted  into a different  kind of matter.  For example,  a
chemical  property  of iron is that it reacts with oxygen  to form a different
kind of matter:  rust. Rust and iron have completely  different  physical  and
chemical  properties.
Figure 1.3 shows another  example  of a chemical  property.  Glucose
test paper changes  colour  in the presence  of glucose.  Thus, a chemical
property  of glucose  test paper is that it changes  colour  in response  to
glucose.  Similarly,  a chemical  property  of glucose  is that it changes  the
colour  of glucose  test paper.
Recall  that some properties  of matter,  such as colour,  and flammabili-
ty, are qualitative.  You can describe  them in words,  but you cannot
measure  them or express  them numerically.  Other properties,  such as
density  and boiling  point, can be measured  and expressed  numerically.
Such properties  are quantitative.  In Investigation  1-A you will use both
qualitative  and quantitative  properties  to examine  a familiar  item.

Observing  Aluminum  Foil
You can easily determine  the length  and width
of a piece of aluminum  foil. You can use a ruler
to measure  these values directly.  What about its
thickness?  In this investigation,  you will design
a method  for calculating  the thickness  of
aluminum  foil.
Problem
How can you determine  the thickness  of a piece
of aluminum  foil, in centimetres?
Safety Precautions
Materials
10 cm x 10 cm square of aluminum  foil
ruler
electronic  balance
calculator
chemical  reference  handbook
Procedure
1. Work together  in small groups.  Brainstorm
possible  methods  for calculating  the thickness
of aluminum  foil.
2. Observe  and record  as many physical
properties  of aluminum  foil as you can.
Do not use the property  of taste.
Never  taste anything  in a laboratory.3. As a group,  review  the properties  you have
recorded.  Reflect  on the possible  methods
you brainstormed.  Decide  on one method,
and try it. (If you are stuck, ask your teacher
for a clue.)
Analysis
1. Consider  your value for the thickness  of the
aluminum  foil. Is it reasonable?  Why or why
not?
2. Compare  your value with the values obtained
by other groups.
(a) In what ways are the values similar?
(b) In what ways are the values different?
Conclusion
3. (a) Explain  how you decided  on the method
you used.
(b) How much confidence  do you have in your
method?  Explain  why you have this level
of confidence.
(c) How much confidence  do you have in
the value you calculated?  Give reasons  to
justify  your answer.
Applications
4. Pure aluminum  has a chemical  property  in
common  with copper  and iron. It reacts with
oxygen  in air to form a different  substance
with different  properties.  This substance  is
called aluminum  oxide. Copper  has the same
chemical  property.  The substance  that results
when copper  reacts with oxygen  is called a
patina. Similarly,  iron reacts with oxygen  to
form rust. Do research  to compare  the proper-
ties and uses (if any) of aluminum  oxide,
copper  patina,  and rust. What technologies
are available  to prevent  their formation?  What
technologies  make use of their formation?
Chapter  1 Observing  Matter > MHR 13
Using Measurements  to Describe  Matter
In the investigation,  you measured  the size and mass of a piece of alu-
minum  foil. You have probably  performed  these types of measurement
many times before.  Measurements  are so much  a part of your daily life
that you can easily take them for granted.  The clothes  you wear come in
different  sizes. Much of the food you eat is sold by the gram, kilogram,
millilitre,  or litre. When  you follow  a recipe,  you measure  amounts.  The
dimensions  of paper and coins are made to exact specifications.  The value
of money  is itself a measurement.
Measurements  such as clothing  size, amounts  of food, and currency
are not standard,  however.  Clothing  sizes in Europe  are different  from
those in North  America.  European  chefs tend to measure  liquids  and
powdered  solids by mass, rather  than by volume.  Currencies,  of course,
differ widely  from country  to country.
To communicate  effectively,  scientists  rely on a standard  system  of
measurement.  As you have learned  in previous  studies,  this system  is
called the International  System  of Units (Le systéme  international
d’unités,  SJ). It allows  scientists  anywhere  in the world to describe
matter  in the same quantitative  language.  There are seven base SI units,
and many more units that are derived  from them. The metre (m), the
kilogram  (kg), and the second  (s) are three of the base SI units. You will
learn about two more base units, the mole (mol) and the kelvin (K), later
in this book.
When  you describe  matter,  you use terms such as mass, volume,  and
temperature.  When  you measure  matter,  you use units such as grams,
cubic centimetres,  and degrees  Celsius.  Table 1.3 lists some quantities  and
units that you will use often in this course.  You are familiar  with all of
them except,  perhaps,  for the mole and the kelvin.  The mole is one of the
most important  units for describing  amounts  of matter.  You will be intro-
duced to the mole in Unit 2. The kelvin  is used to measure  temperature.
You will learn more about the kelvin  scale in Unit 5. Consult  Appendix  E
if you would  like to review  other SI quantities  and units.

Measurement  and Uncertainty
Before you look more closely  at matter,  you need to know how much you
can depend  on measurements.  How can you recognize  when a measure-
ment is trustworthy?  How can you tell if it is only an approximation?  For
example,  there are five Great Lakes. Are you sure there are five? Is there
any uncertainty  associated  with the value “five” in this case? What about
the number  of millilitres  in 1 L, or the number  of seconds  in 1 min?
Numbers  such as these—numbers  that you can count or numbers  that are
true by definition—are  called exact numbers.  You are certain  that there
are five Great Lakes (or nine books on the shelf, or ten students  in the
classroom)  because  you can count them. Likewise,  you are certain  that
there are 1000 mL in 1 L, and 60 s in 1 min. These relationships  are true
by definition.
Now consider  the numbers  you used and the calculations  you did in
Investigation  1-A. They are listed in Figure 1.4.
Did you verify  these dimensions?
Are you certain  that each side
"~~  _ measured  exactly  10 cm? Could
it have been 9.9 cm or 10.1 cm?a The area of the aluminum
square measured  100 cm?
(10 cm x 10 cm).
If you used an electronic
balance,  are you certain  that the
digital read-out  was accurate?
Did the last digit fluctuate  at~~ all? If you used a triple-beam
balance,  are you certain  that you
read the correct  value? Could
it have been 0.34 g or 0.32 g?a The mass of the aluminum
square,  as measured  by an
electronic  balance,  may
have been about 0.33 g.
What reference  did you use to find
the density?  Did you consult  more
than one reference?  Suppose
that the density  was actually~~ 2.699 g/cm3. Would this make a
difference  in your calculations?
Would  this make a difference  in
the certainty  of your answer?a The density  of aluminum
is 2.70 g/cm? at a given
temperature.
Are you certain  that this value
is fair, given the other values
that you worked  with? Is it fairto
have such a precise  value, with
"~~ so many digits, when there are
so few digits (just two: the 1 and
the 0) in your dimensions  of the
aluminum  square?a The thickness  of the
aluminum  square,  calculated

GETTER  These two rulers
measure  the same length of the
blue square.  Ruler A is calibrated
into divisions  of 1 cm. Ruler B
is calibrated  into divisions
of 0.1 cm. Which ruler can
help you make more precise
measurements?During  the investigations  in this textbook,  you will use equipment
such as rulers,  balances,  graduated  cylinders,  and thermometers  to
measure  matter.  You will calculate  values  with a calculator  or with
specially  programmed  software.  How exact can your measurements  and
calculations  be? How exact should  they be?
Two main factors  affect your ability  to record  and communicate  meas-
urements  and calculations.  One factor is the instruments  you use. The
other factor is your ability  to read and interpret  what the instruments  tell
you. Examine  Figures  1.5 and 1.6. They will help you understand  which
digits you can know with certainty,  and which  digits are uncertain.
What is the length measured  by ruler A? Is it 4.2 cm, or is it 4.3 cm? You
cannot  be certain.  The 2 of 4.2 is an estimate.  The 3 of 4.3 is also an
estimate.  In both cases,  therefore,  you are uncertain  about  the last
(farthest  right) digit.
rulerA
ruler B
What is the length measured  by ruler B? Is it 4.27 cm or 4.28 cm? Again,  you
cannot  be certain.  Ruler B lets you make more precise  measurements  than
ruler A. Despite  ruler B’s higher  precision,  however,  you must still estimate
the last digit. The 7 of 4.27 is an estimate.  The 8 of 4.28 is also an estimate.
(GGETIOREG)  These two thermometers  measure  the same temperature.
Thermometer  A is calibrated  into divisions  of 0.1°C. Thermometer  B is
calibrated  into divisions  of 1°C. Which  thermometer  lets you make more
precise  measurements?  Which digits in each thermometer  reading  are
you certain  about?  Which digits are you uncertain  about?
16 MHR-* Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Significant  Digits, Certainty,  and Measurements
All measurements  involve  uncertainty.  One source of this uncertainty
is the measuring  device itself. Another  source  is your ability  to perceive
and interpret  a reading.  In fact, you cannot  measure  anything  with
complete  certainty.  The last (farthest  right) digit in any measurement  is
always  an estimate.
The digits that you record  when you measure  something  are called
significant  digits. Significant  digits include  the digits that you are certain
about and  a final, uncertain  digit that you estimate.  For example,  4.28 g
has three significant  digits. The first two digits, the 4 and the 2, are
certain.  The last digit, the 8, is an estimate.  Therefore,  it is uncertain.
The value 4.3 has two significant  digits. The 4 is certain,  and the 3 is
uncertain.
How Can You Tell Which Digits Are Significant?
You can identify  the number  of significant  digits in any value. Table 1.4
lists some rules to help you do this.

Explaining  Three Significant  Digits
The Great Lakes contain 22 700 km? of water. Is there exactly  that amount
of water in the Great Lakes? No, 22 700 km? is an approximate  value. The
actual volume  could be anywhere  from 22 651 km® to 22 749 km%. You can
use scientific  notation  to rewrite 22 700 km? as 2.27 x 104 km. This shows
that only three digits are significant.  (Gee Appendix  E at the back of the
book, if you would like to review  scientific  notation.)
Explaining  Five Significant  Digits
What if you were able to measure  the volume  of water in the Great Lakes?
You could verify the value of 22 700 km®. Then all five digits (including  the
zeros) would be significant.  Here again, scientific  notation  lets you show
clearly  the five significant  digits: 2.2700 x 104 km?.

Accuracy  and Precision
In everyday  speech,  you might  use the terms “accuracy”  and “precision”
to mean the same thing. In science,  however,  these terms are related  to
certainty.  Each, then, has a specific  meaning.
Accuracy  refers to how close a given quantity  is to an accepted  or
expected  value. (See Figure 1.7.) Precision  may refer to the exactness  of a
measurement.  For example,  ruler B in Figure 1.5 lets you measure  length
with greater  precision  than ruler A. Precision  may also refer to the close-
ness of a series of data points.  Data that are very close to one another  are
said to be precise.  Examine  Figure 1.8. Notice  that a set of data can be
precise  but not accurate.
Under  standard  conditions  of temperature  and pressure,  5 mL of water has a
mass of 5 g. Why does the reading  on this balance  showa different  value?

Calculating  with Significant  Digits
In this course,  you will often take measurements  and use them to calcu-
late other quantities.  You must be careful  to keep track of which digits
in your calculations  and results are significant.  Why? Your results
should  not imply more certainty  than your measured  quantities  justify.
This is especially  important  when you use a calculator.  Calculators
usually  report  results  with far more figures—greater  certainty  —than
your data warrant.  Always  remember  that calculators  do not make
decisions  about certainty.  You do.
There are three rules for reporting  significant  digits in calculated
answers.  These rules are summarized  in Table 1.5. Reflect  on how they
apply to your previous  experiences.  Then examine  the Sample
Problems  that follow.
Table 1.5 Rules for Reporting  Significant  Digits in Calculations
Rule 1: Multiplying  and Dividing
The value with the fewest number  of significant  digits, going into the
calculation,  determines  the number  of significant  digits that you should
report in your answer.
Rule 2: Adding  and Subtracting
The value with the fewest  number  of decimal  places,  going into the
calculation,  determines  the number  of decimal  places  that you should
report in your answer.
Rule 3: Rounding
To get the appropriate  number  of significant  digits (rule 1) or decimal
places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer.
If your answer  ends in a number  that is greater  than 5, increase  the
preceding  digit by 1. For example,  2.346 can be rounded  to 2.35.
If your answer  ends with a number  that is less than 5, leave the preceding
number  unchanged.  For example,  5.73 can be rounded  to 5.7.
If your answer  ends with 5, increase  the preceding  number  by1 if it is odd.
Leave the preceding  number  unchanged  if it is even. For example,  18.35
can be rounded  to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded  to 18.2.
Reporting  Volume  Using Significant  Digits
Problem

to be 6.78 cm long, 3.906 cm wide, and 11 cm tall. Determine  its
volume  to the correct  number  of significant  digits.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate  the volume  of the iron sample.  Then you need
to write this volume  using the correct  number  of significant  digits.

What Is Given?
You know the three dimensions  of the iron sample.
Length  = 6.78 cm (three significant  digits)
Width  = 3.906 cm (four significant  digits)
Height  = 11 cm (two significant  digits)
Plan Your Strategy
To calculate  the volume,  use the formula
Volume  = Length  x Width  x Height
V=Ixwxh
Find the value with the smallest  number  of significant  digits. Your
answer  can have only this number  of significant  digits.
Act on Your Strategy
V=Ilxwxh
= 6.78 cm X 3.906 cm X 11 cm
= 291.309  48 cm?
The value 11 cm has the smallest  number  of significant  digits: two.
Thus, your answer  can have only two significant  digits. In order to
have only two significant  digits, you need to put your answer  into
scientific  notation.
V = 2.9 x 10? cm?
Therefore,  the volume  is 2.9 x 10? cm?, to two significant  digits.
Check  Your Solution
e Your answer  is in cm’®. This is a unit of volume.
e Your answer  has two significant  digits. The least number  of
significant  digits in the question  is also two.

e Add the masses  together,  aligning  them at the decimal  point.
e Underline  the estimated  (farthest  right) digit in each value. This
is a technique  you can use to help you keep track of the number
of estimated  digits in your final answer.
e In the question,  two values  have the fewest  decimal  places: 12.5
and 79.0. You need to round your answer  so that it has only one
decimal  place.

Notice that adding the values 12.5
results in an answer  that has 145.67
three decimal  places. Using 79.0

Chemistry,  Calculations,  and Communication
Mathematical  calculations  are an important  part of chemistry.  You will
need your calculation  skills to help you investigate  many of the topics in
this textbook.  You will also need calculation  skills to communicate  your
measurements  and results clearly  when you do activities  and investiga-
tions. Chemistry,  however,  is more than measurements  and calculations.
Chemistry  also involves  finding  and interpreting  patterns.  This is the

Air Canada  Flight 143
Air Canada  Flight 143 was en route from
Montréal  to Edmonton  on July 23, 1983. The
airplane  was one of Air Canada’s  first Boeing
767s, and its systems  were almost  completely
computerized.
While on the ground  in Montréal,  Captain
Robert  Pearson  found that the airplane’s  fuel
processor  was malfunctioning.  As well, all
three fuel gauges  were not operating.  Pearson
believed,  however,  that it was safe to fly the
airplane  using manual  fuel measurements.
Partway  into the flight, as the airplane
passed  over Red Lake, Ontario,  one of two fuel
pumps  in the left wing failed. Soon the other
fuel pump failed and the left engine  flamed
out. Pearson  decided  to head to the closest
major airport,  in Winnipeg.  He began  the
airplane’s  descent.  At 8400 m, and more than
160 km from the Winnipeg  Airport,  the right
engine  also failed. The airplane  had run out
of fuel.
In Montréal,  the ground  crew had deter-
mined  that the airplane  had 7682 L of fuel in
its fuel tank. Captain  Pearson  had calculated
that the mass of fuel needed  for the trip from
Montréal  to Edmonton  was 22 300 kg. Since
fuel is measured  in litres, Pearson  asked a
mechanic  how to convert  litres into kilograms.
He was told to multiply  the amount  in litres
by 1.77.By multiplying  7682 L by 1.77, Pearson
calculated  that the airplane  had 13 597 kg of
fuel on board. He subtracted  this value from
the total amount  of fuel for the trip, 22 300 kg,
and found that 8703 kg more fuel was needed.
To convert  kilograms  back into litres,
Pearson  divided  the mass, 8703 kg, by 1.77.
The result was 4916 L. The crew added  4916 L
of fuel to the airplane’s  tanks.
This conversion  number,  1.77, had been
used in the past because  the density  of jet fuel
is 1.77 pounds  per litre. Unfortunately,  the
number  that should  have been used to convert
litres into kilograms  was 0.803. The crew
should  have added 20 088 L of fuel, not 4916 L.
First officer  Maurice  Quintal  calculated
their rate of descent.  He determined  that they
would  never make Winnipeg.  Pearson  turned
north and headed  toward  Gimli, an abandoned
Air Force base. Gimli’s  left runway  was being
used for drag-car  and go-kart  races.
Surrounding  the runway  were families  and
campers.  It was into this situation  that Pearson
and Quintal  landed  the airplane.
Tires blew upon impact.  The airplane  skid-
ded down the runway  as racers and spectators
scrambled  to get out of the way. Flight 143
finally  came to rest 1200 m later, a mere 30 m
from the dazed onlookers.
Miraculously  no one was seriously  injured.
As news spread  around  the world,  the airplane
became  known  as “The Gimli Glider.”

Classifying  Matter
and Its Changes
Matter  is constantly  changing.  Plants grow by converting  matter  from
the soil and air into matter  they can use. Water falls from the sky, evapo-
rates, and condenses  again to form liquid water in a never-ending  cycle.
You can probably  suggest  many more examples  of matter  changing.
Matter  changes  in response  to changes  in energy.  Adding  energy  to
matter  or removing  energy  from matter  results  in a change.  Figure 1.9
shows a familiar  example  of a change  involving  matter  and energy.
removing  energy

>
adding  energy
GETTER)  Like all matter, water can change its state when energy is added or removed.
Physical  and Chemical  Changes  in Matter
A change  of state alters the appearance  of matter.  The composition  of
matter  remains  the same, however,  regardless  of its state. For example,  ice,
liquid water, and water vapour  are all the same kind of matter:  water.
Melting  and boiling  other kinds of matter  have the same result. The
appearance  and some other physical  properties  change,  but the matter
retains  its identity—its  composition.  Changes  that affect the physical
appearance  of matter,  but not its composition,  are physical  changes.
Figure 1.10 shows  a different  kind of change  involving  water.
Electrical  energy  is passed  through  water, causing  it to decompose.  Two
completely  different  kinds of matter  result from this process:  hydrogen  gas
and oxygen  gas. These gases have physical  and chemical  properties  that
are different  from the properties  of water and from each other’s  properties.
Therefore,  decomposing  water is a change  that affects  the composition  of
water. Changes  that alter the composition  of matter  are called chemical
changes.  Iron rusting,  wood burning,  and bread baking  are three examples
of chemical  changes.
You learned  about physical  and chemical  properties  earlier  in this
chapter.  A physical  change  results  in a change  of physical  properties
only. A chemical  change  results  in a change  of both physical  and
chemical  properties.1.3

Classifying  Matter
All matter  can be classified  into two groups:  mixtures  and pure sub-
stances.  A mixture  is a physical  combination  of two or more kinds of
matter.  For example,  soil is a mixture  of sand, clay, silt, and decom-
posed leaves and animal  bodies.  If you look at soil under a magnifying
glass, you can see these different  components.  Figure 1.11 shows
another  way to see the components  of soil.
The components  in a mixture  can occur in different  proportions
(relative  quantities).  Each individual  component  retains  its identity.
Mixtures  in which  the different  components  are clearly  visible  are
called heterogeneous  mixtures.  The prefix “hetero-”  comes from the
Greek  word heteros,  meaning  “different.”
Mixtures  in which  the components  are blended  together  so well
that the mixture  looks like just one substance  are called homogeneous
mixtures.  The prefix “homo-  ” comes from the Greek  word homos,
meaning  “the same.”  Saltwater,  clean air, and grape juice are common
examples.  Homogeneous  mixtures  are also called solutions.  You will
investigate  solutions  in Unit 3.
A pure substance  has a definite  composition,  which  stays the same
in response  to physical  changes.  A lump of copper  is a pure substance.
Water (with nothing  dissolved  in it) is also a pure substance.  Diamond,
carbon  dioxide,  gold, oxygen,  and aluminum  are pure substances,  too.
Pure substances  are further  classified  into elements  and com-
pounds.  An element  is a pure substance  that cannot  be separated
chemically  into any simpler  substances.  Copper,  zinc, hydrogen,
oxygen,  and carbon  are examples  of elements.
A compound  is a pure substance  that results  when two or more
elements  combine  chemically  to form a different  substance.
Compounds  can be broken  down into elements  using chemical  process-
es. For example,  carbon  dioxide  is a compound.  It can be separated  into
the elements  carbon  and oxygen.  The Concept  Organizer  on the next
page outlines  the classification  of matter  at a glance.  The ThoughtLab
reinforces  your understanding  of properties,  mixtures,  and separation
of substances.

You frequently  use your knowledge  of properties
to make and separate  mixtures  and substances.
You probably  do this most often in the kitchen.
Even the act of sorting  clean laundry,  however,
depends  on your ability  to recognize  and make
use of physical  properties.  This activity  is a
“thought  experiment.”  You will use your under-
standing  of properties  to mix and separate  a
variety  of chemicals,  all on paper. Afterward,
your teacher  may ask you to test your ideas,
either in the laboratory  or at home in the kitchen.
Procedure
1. Consider  the following  chemicals:  table salt,
water, baking soda, sugar, iron filings,  sand,
vegetable  oil, milk, and vinegar.  Identify  each
chemical  as a mixture  or a pure substance.
2. Which of these chemicals  can you mix
together  without  producing  a chemical
change?  In your notebook,  record as many
of these physical  combinations  as you can.
3. Which of these chemicals  can you mix
together  to produce  a chemical  change?
Record  as many of these chemical
combinations  as you can.4. Record a mixture  that is made with four of
the chemicals.  Then suggest  one or more
techniques  that you can use to separate  the
four chemicals  from one another.  Write notes
and sketch labelled  diagrams  to show your
techniques.  Identify  the properties  that your
techniques  depend  on.
Analysis
1. In step 2, what properties  of the chemicals  did
you use to determine  your combinations?
2. In step 3, what properties  did you use to
determine  your combinations?
Application
3. Exchange  your four-chemical  mixture  with
a partner.  Do not include  your notes and
diagrams.  Challenge  your partner  to suggest
techniques  to separate  the four chemicals.
Then assess  each other's  techniques.  What
modifications,  if any, would you make to
your original  techniques?
Chapter 1 Observing  Matter * MHR 2]
Section  Wrap-up
Notice  that the classification  system  for matter, shown  in the Concept
Organizer,  is based mainly  on the changes  that matter  undergoes:
e physical  changes  to separate  mixtures  into elements  or compounds
e chemical  changes  to convert  compounds  or elements  into different
compounds  or elements
To explain  how and why these chemical  changes  occur, you must look
“deeper”  into matter.  You must look at its composition.  This is what you
will do in the next chapter.  You will see how examining  the composition
of matter  leads to a different  classification  system:  the periodic  table. You
will also see how the periodic  table allows chemists  to make predictions
about the properties  and behaviour  of matter.

Elements  and

Today, if you want to travel by air across the country or overseas, you
take an airplane.  During  the first three decades  of the twentieth  century,
you would  have boarded  a hydrogen-filled  balloon  such as the one shown
in the black-and-white  photograph.  Large and small airships  such as
these, called dirigibles,  were common  sights in the skies above many
North American  and European  cities. Unfortunately,  during  a landing  in
Lakehurst,  New Jersey in 1937, the hydrogen  in one of these airships,  the
Hindenburg,  ignited.  The resulting  explosion  killed 36 people,  and
marked  the end of the use of hydrogen  for dirigibles.
Gas-filled  airships  and balloons  like the one shown  in the colour  pho-
tograph  now use helium  gas instead  of hydrogen.  Helium,  unlike  hydro-
gen, does not burn. In fact, helium  is a highly  unreactive  gas. What is it
about hydrogen  that makes it so reactive?  Why is helium  so unreactive?
The answer  lies in the structure  of the atoms of these elements.  In previ-
ous science  courses,  you traced  the history  of our understanding  of atoms
and their structure.  You also learned  how chemists  use properties  to
arrange  elements,  and the atoms of which  they are made, into a remark-
able tool called the periodic  table. This chapter  highlights  and expands  on
key ideas from your earlier  studies.  By the end of the chapter,  you will
have a greater  understanding  of the properties  of elements  at an atomic
level. This understanding  is a crucial  foundation  for concepts  that you
will explore  in your chemistry  course  this year.
Our modern  understanding  of mat-
ter and its composition  was largely
developed  before scientists
obtained  direct evidence  for the
istence  of atoms. How can you

How scientists  visualize  the
atom has changed  greatly
since Dalton proposed  his
atomic  theory in the early nine-
teenth century.  Technology  has
played an essential  role in
these changes.  At a library or
on the Internet,  research  the
key modifications  to the model
of the atom. Create a summary
chart to show your findings.
Include  the scientists  involved,
the technologies  they used, the
discoveries  they made, and the
impact  of their discoveries  on
the model of the atom. If you
wish, use a suitable  graphics
program  to set up your chart.Atoms  and Their Composition
Elements  are the basic substances  that make up all matter.  About  90
elements  exist naturally  in the universe.  The two smallest  and least dense
of these elements  are hydrogen  and helium.  Yet hydrogen  and helium
account  for nearly  98% of the mass of the entire universe!
Here on Earth, there is very little hydrogen  in its pure elemental  form.
There is even less helium.  In fact, there is such a small amount  of helium
on Earth that it escaped  scientists’  notice until 1895.
Regardless  of abundance,  any two samples  of hydrogen  —from
anywhere  on Earth or far beyond  in outer space —are identical  to each
other. For example,  a sample  of hydrogen  from Earth’s  atmosphere  is iden-
tical to a sample  of hydrogen  from the Sun. The same is true for helium.
This is because  each element  is made up of only a single  kind of atom.
For example,  the element  hydrogen  contains  only hydrogen  atoms. The
element  helium  contains  only helium  atoms. What, however,  is an atom?
The Atomic  Theory  of Matter
John Dalton  was a British  teacher  and self-taught  scientist.  In 1809, he
described  atoms as solid, indestructible  particles  that make up all matter.
(See Figure 2.1.) Dalton’s  concept  of the atom is one of several  ideas in
his atomic  theory  of matter,  which  is outlined  on the next page. Keep in
mind that scientists  have modified  several  of Dalton’s  ideas, based on later
discoveries.  You will learn about these modifications  at the end of this
section.  See if you can infer what some of them are as you study the struc-
ture of the atom on the next few pages.
GETTEEAI  This illustration  shows an atom as John Dalton (1766-1844)  imagined  it.
Many reference  materials  refer to Dalton’s  concept  of the atom as the “billiard  ball
model.”  Dalton,  however,  was an avid lawn bowler.  His concept  of the atom was almost
certainly  influenced  by the smooth,  solid bowling  balls used in the game.
34 MHR-* Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Dalton’s  Atomic  Theory  (1809)
e All matter  is made up of tiny particles  called atoms.  An atom
cannot  be created,  destroyed,  or divided  into smaller  particles.
e The atoms of one element  cannot  be converted  into the atoms of
any another  element.
e All the atoms of one element  have the same properties,  such as
mass and size. These properties  are different  from the properties
of the atoms of any other element.
e Atoms  of different  elements  combine  in specific  proportions  to
form compounds.
The Modern  View of the Atom
An atom is the smallest  particle  of an element  that still retains  the identi-
ty and properties  of the element.  For example,  the smallest  particle  of the
writing  material  in your pencil is a carbon  atom. (Pencil  “lead” is actually
a substance  called graphite.  Graphite  is a form of the element  carbon.)
An average  atom is about 10°'° m in diameter.  Such  a tiny size is
difficult  to visualize.  If an average  atom were the size of a grain of sand,
a strand of your hair would  be about 60 m in diameter!
Atoms  themselves  are made up of even smaller  particles.  These
subatomic  particles  are protons,  neutrons,  and electrons.  Protons  and
neutrons  cluster  together  to form the central  core, or nucleus,  of an atom.
Fast-moving  electrons  occupy  the space that surrounds  the nucleus  of
the atom. As their names  imply, subatomic  particles  are associated  with
electrical  charges.  Table 2.1 and Figure 2.2 summarize  the general  features
and properties  of an atom and its three subatomic  particles.
Table 2.1 Properties  of Protons,  Neutrons,  and Electrons
Subatomic  particle | Charge | Symbol | Mass (in g) Radius (in m)
electron 1- e 9.02 x 10-78 | smaller  than 10-18
proton 1+ pt 1.67 x 10°*4 | 10°*
neutron 0 n? 1.67 x 10-74 | 10°
Expressing  the Mass of Subatomic  Particles
As you can see in Table 2.1, subatomic  particles  are incredibly  small.
Suppose  that you could count out protons  or neutrons  equal to
602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (or 6.02 x 107%)
and put them on a scale. They would  have a mass of about 1 g. This
means  that one proton  or neutron  has a mass of
1g6.02x10" 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001 66 g
= 1.66x107*  g
It is inconvenient  to measure  the mass of subatomic  particles  using units
such as grams.  Instead,  chemists  use a unit called an atomic  mass unit
(symbol  u). A proton  has a mass of about 1 u, which  is equal to
1.66 x 10°** g.
GETEGEZ7  This illustration  shows  the modern  view of an atom. Notice  that a fuzzy,
cloud-like  region surrounds  the atomic  nucleus.  Electrons  move rapidly  throughout  this
region,  which represents  most of the atom’s  volume.CHECKP@INT
XThe atomic  theory  was a
convincing  explanation  of
the behaviour  of matter. It
explained  two established
scientific  laws: the law of
conservation  of mass and the
law of definite  composition.
e Law of conservation  of
mass: During a chemical
reaction,  the total mass of
the substances  involved
does not change.
e Law of definite
proportion.  Elements
always combine  to form
compounds  in fixed
proportions  by mass.
(For example,  pure water
always contains  the
elements  hydrogen  and
oxygen,  combined  in the
following  proportions:
11% hydrogen  and 89%
oxygen.)
How does the atomic  theory
explain  these two laws?

The number  6.02 x 10? is
called the Avogadro  constant.
In Chapter  5, you will learn
more about the Avogadro
constant.
A proton is about 1837 times
more massive  than an elec-
tron. According  to Table 2.1,
the mass of an electron  is
9.02 x 10-8 g. This value is so
small that scientists  consider
the mass of an electron  to be
approximately  equal to zero.
Thus, electrons  are not taken
into account  when calculating
the mass of an atom.The Nucleus  of an Atom
All the atoms of a particular  element  have the same number  of protons
in their nucleus.  For example,  all hydrogen  atoms —anywhere  in the
universe — have one proton.  All helium  atoms have two protons.  All
oxygen  atoms have eight protons.  Chemists  use the term atomic  number
(symbol  Z) to refer to the number  of protons  in the nucleus  of each atom
of an element.
As you know, the nucleus  of an atom also contains  neutrons.  In fact,
the mass of an atom is due to the combined  masses  of its protons  and
neutrons.  Therefore,  an element’s  mass number  (symbol  A) is the total
number  of protons  and neutrons  in the nucleus  of one of its atoms. Each
proton  or neutron  is counted  as one unit of the mass number.  For exam-
ple, an oxygen  atom, which  has 8 protons  and 8 neutrons  in its nucleus,
has a mass number  of 16. A uranium  atom, which  has 92 protons  and
146 neutrons,  has a mass number  of 238.
Information  about an element’s  protons  and neutrons  is often
summarized  using the chemical  notation  shown  in Figure 2.3. The letter X
represents  the atomic  symbol  for an element.  (The atomic  symbol  is also
called the element  symbol.)  Each element  has a different  atomic  symbol.
All chemists,  throughout  the world,  use the same atomic  symbols.  Over
the coming  months,  you will probably  learn to recognize  many of these
symbols  instantly.  Appendix  G, at the back of this book, lists the elements
in alphabetical  order, along with their symbols.  You can also find the ele-
ments and their symbols  in the periodic  table on the inside  back cover of
this textbook,  and in Appendix  C. (You will review  and extend  your
understanding  of the periodic  table, in section  2.2.)
mass number A
atomic  symbol
atomic number Z
Notice  what the chemical  notation  in Figure 2.3 does, and does not,
tell you about the structure  of an element’s  atoms. For example,  consider
the element  fluorine:  13F. The mass number  (the superscript  19) indicates
that fluorine  has a total of 19 protons  and neutrons.  The atomic  number
(subscript  9) indicates  that fluorine  has 9 protons.  Neither  the mass num-
ber nor the atomic  number  tells you how many neutrons  fluorine  has. You
can calculate  this value, however,  by subtracting  the atomic  number  from
the mass number.
Number  of neutrons  = Mass number  — Atomic  number
=A-Z

Using the Atomic  Number  to Infer the Number  of Electrons
As just mentioned,  the atomic  number  and mass number  do not give you
direct information  about the number  of neutrons  in an element.  They do
not give you the number  of electrons,  either. You can infer the number  of
electrons,  however,  from the atomic  number.  The atoms of each element
are electrically  neutral.  This means  that their positive  charges  (protons)
and negative  charges  (electrons)  must balance  one another.  In other words,
in the neutral  atom of any element,  the number  ofprotons  is equal to the
number  of electrons.  For example,  a neutral  hydrogen  atom contains  one
proton,  so it must also contain  one electron.  A neutral  oxygen  atom con-
tains eight protons,  so it must contain  eight electrons.
Isotopes  and Atomic  Mass
All neutral  atoms of the same element  contain  the same number  of
protons  and, therefore,  the same number  of electrons.  The number  of
neutrons  can vary, however.  For example,  most of the oxygen  atoms in
nature  have eight neutrons  in their atomic  nuclei.  In other words,  most
oxygen  atoms have a mass number  of 16 (8 protons  + 8 neutrons).  As you
can see in Figure 2.4 on the next page, there are also two other naturally
occurring  forms of oxygen.  One of these has nine neutrons,  so A = 17. The
other has ten neutrons,  so A = 18. These three forms of oxygen  are called
isotopes.  Isotopes  are atoms of an element  that have the same number  of
protons  but different  numbers  of neutrons.eat LINK

Radioisotopes  decay because
their nuclei are unstable.  The
time it takes for nuclei to decay
varies greatly.  For example,  it
takes billions  of years for only
half of the nucleus  of naturally
occurring  uranium-238  to
decay. The nuclei of other
radioisotopes  — mainly  those
that scientists  have synthe-
sized — decay much more
rapidly.  The nuclei of some
isotopes,  such as sodium-22,
take about 20 years to decay.
For calcium-47,  this decay
occurs in a matter of days. The
nuclei of most synthetic
radioisotopes  decay so quickly,
however,  that the radioiso-
topes exist for mere fractions
of a second.

The isotopes  of an element  have very similar  chemical  properties  because
they have the same number  of protons  and electrons.  They differ in mass,
however,  because  they have different  numbers  of neutrons.
Some isotopes  are more unstable  than others. Their nuclei  (plural
of nucleus)  are more likely to decay, releasing  energy  and subatomic
particles.  This process,  called radioactivity,  happens  spontaneously.
All uranium  isotopes,  for example,  have unstable  nuclei.  They are called
radioactive  isotopes,  or radioisotopes  for short. Many isotopes  are not
radioisotopes.  Oxygen’s  three naturally  occurring  isotopes,  for example,
are stable.  In contrast,  chemists  have successfully  synthesized  ten other
isotopes  of oxygen,  all of which  are unstable  radioisotopes.  (What prod-
ucts result when radioisotopes  decay?  You will find out in Chapter  4.)
Electrons  in Atoms
So far, much of the discussion  about the atom has concentrated  on the
nucleus  and its protons  and neutrons.  What about electrons?  What is their
importance  to the atom? Recall  that electrons  occupy  the space surround-
ing the nucleus.  Therefore,  they are the first subatomic  particles  that are
likely to interact  when atoms come near one another.  In a way, electrons
are on the “front lines” of atomic  interactions.  The number  and arrange-
ment of the electrons  in an atom determine  how the atom will react, if at
all, with other atoms. As you will learn in section  2.2, and throughout  the
rest of this unit, electrons  are responsible  for the chemical  properties  of
the elements.
Revisiting  the Atomic  Theory
John Dalton  did not know about subatomic  particles  when he developed
his atomic  theory.  Even so, the modern  atomic  theory  (shown  on the next

Examine  the comments  to the right of each point. They explain  how the

The term periodic  means
“repeating  in an identifiable
pattern.”  For example,  a calen-
dar is periodic.  It organizes
the days of the months  into a
repeating  series of weeks.
What other examples  of
periodicity  can you think of?Atoms,  Elements,
and the Periodic  Table
By the mid 1800’s,  there were 65 known  elements.  Chemists  studied  these
elements  intensively  and recorded  detailed  information  about their reac-
tivity and the masses  of their atoms. Some chemists  began to recognize
patterns  in the properties  and behaviour  of many of these elements.  (See
Figure 2.5.)
Other sets of elements  display  similar  trends in their properties  and
behaviour.  For example,  oxygen  (O), sulfur (S), selenium  (Se), and
tellurium  (Te) share similar  properties.  The same is true of fluorine  (F),
chlorine  (Cl), bromine  (Br), and iodine (I). These similarities  prompted
chemists  to search  for a fundamental  property  that could be used to
organize  all the elements.  One chemist,  Dmitri  Mendeleev  (1834-1907),
sequenced  the known  elements  in order of increasing  atomic  mass. The
result was a table of the elements,  organized  so that elements  with similar
properties  were arranged  in the same column.  Because  Mendeleev’s
arrangement  highlighted  periodic  (repeating)  patterns  of properties,  it was
called a periodic  table.
The modern  periodic  table is a modification  of the arrangement  first
proposed  by Mendeleev.  Instead  of organizing  elements  according  to
atomic  mass, the modern  periodic  table organizes  elements  according  to
atomic  number.  According  to the periodic  law, the chemical  and physical
properties  of the elements  repeat  in a regular,  periodic  pattern  when they
are arranged  according  to their atomic  number.
Figures  2.6 and 2.7 outline  the key features  of the modern  periodic
table. Take some time to review  these features.  Another  version  of the
periodic  table, containing  additional  data, appears  on the inside back
cover of this textbook,  as well as in Appendix  C.

Electrons  and the Periodic  Table
You have seen how the periodic  table organizes  elements  so that those
with similar  properties  are in the same group. You have also seen how
the periodic  table distinguishes  among  metals,  non-metals,  and metalloids.
Other details of the organization  of the periodic  table may seem baffling,
however.  Why, for example,  are there different  numbers  of elements  in
the periods?
The reason  for this, and other details  of the periodic  table’s  organiza-
tion, involves  the number  and arrangement  of electrons  in the atoms of
each element.  To appreciate  the importance  of electrons  to the periodic
table, it is necessary  to revisit  the structure  of the atom.
In the following  ExpressLab,  you will observe  elements  in much the
same way that scientists  did in the early twentieth  century.  In doing so,
these scientists  set the stage for a new understanding  of matter  and the
electrical  structure  of its atoms.

In this activity,  you will use a device  called a
diffraction  grating.  |It separates  light into banded
patterns  of colour  (a spectrum).  Different  colours
of light have different  frequencies  and wave-
lengths,  so they have different  amounts  of
energy.  Red light is less energetic,  for example,
than blue light.

high enough  to cause serious  injury. Observe
them only from a safe distance,  as determined
by your teacher.

1. If the electrons  in a discharge  tube are moving
everywhere  in the space around  the nucleus,
their spectrum  should  look like the spectrum
of an ordinary  light bulb. What does hydro-
gen’s spectrum  look like? How do the spectra
of the other elements  compare  with the
spectrum  of a light bulb and the spectrum
of hydrogen?
2. Hydrogen  has only one electron.  Why, then,
does its spectrum  have four coloured  lines?
3. Why is the light that is emitted  by hydrogen
different  from the light that is emitted  by
the other elements?  Explain  the difference
in terms of electrons.

4. What do gas discharge  tubes have in common
with street lights? Do research  to find out
which gases are used in street lamps,  and why
certain  gases are chosen  for certain locations.
Electrons  and Energy  Levels
Electrons  cannot  move haphazardly.  Their
movement  around  an atomic  nucleus  is restricted
to fixed regions  of space. These regions  are three-
dimensional,  similar  to the layers of an onion.
Figure 2.8 shows a representation  of these
regions.  Keep in mind that they are not solid.
They are volumes  of space in which  electrons  may
be found. You may have heard these regions
called energy  shells or shells. In this textbook,
they are called energy  levels. An electron  that
is moving  in a lower energy  level is close to the
nucleus.  It has less energy  than it would  if it
were moving  in a higher  energy  level.

Your Chemistry  11 Electronic
Learning  Partner  has an
interactive  activity  to help you
assess  your understanding
of the relationship  among
elements,  their atomic number,
and their position  in the
periodic  table.There is a limit to the number  of electrons  that can occupy  each ener-
gy level. For example,  a maximum  of two electrons  can occupy  the first
energy  level. A maximum  of eight electrons  can occupy  the second  energy
level. The periodic  trends  (repeating  patterns)  that result from organizing
the elements  by their atomic  number  are linked  to the way in which
electrons  occupy  and fill energy  levels. (See Figure 2.9.)
As shown  in Figure 2.9A, a common  way to show the arrangement  of
electrons  in an atom is to draw circles  around  the atomic  symbol.  Each
circle represents  an energy  level. Dots represent  electrons  that occupy
each energy  level. This kind of diagram  is called a Bohr-Rutherford  dia-
gram. It is named  after two scientists  who contributed  their insights  to the
atomic  theory.
Figure 2.9B shows  that the first energy  level is full when two electrons
occupy  it. Only two elements  have two or fewer electrons:  hydrogen  and
helium.  Hydrogen  has one electron,  and helium  has two. These elements,
with their electrons  in the first energy  level, make up Period 1 of the
periodic  table.
As you can see in Figure 2.9C, Period 2 elements  have two occupied
energy  levels. The second  energy  level is full when eight electrons  occupy
it. Neon, with a total of ten electrons,  has its first and second  energy  levels
filled. Notice  how the second  energy  level fills with electrons  as you move
across the period  from lithium  to fluorine.

them. Elements  58 through  71 belong  in Period  6, so their electrons
occupy  six energy  levels. Elements  90 through  103 belong  in Period 7, so
their electrons  occupy  seven energy  levels. Chemists  and chemical  tech-
nologists  tend to use only a few of the inner transition  elements  (notably
uranium  and plutonium)  on a regular  basis. Thus, it is more convenient  to
place all the inner transition  elements  below the periodic  table.

GPETIAEATY  The “long form” of the periodic  table includes  the inner transition  metals
in their proper  place.
The Group-Related  Pattern
The second  pattern  emerges  when you consider  the electron  arrangements
in the main-group  elements:  the elements  in Groups  1 (IA), 2 (IIA), and
13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIA).  All the elements  in each main group have the same
number  of electrons  in their highest  (outer) energy  level. The electrons
that occupy  the outer energy  level are called valence  electrons.  The term
“valence”  comes  from a Latin word that means “to be strong.”  “Valence
electrons”  is a suitable  name because  the outer energy  level electrons  are
the electrons  involved  when atoms form compounds.  In other words,
valence  electrons  are responsible  for the chemical  behaviour  of elements.
Chapter  2 Elements  and the Periodic  Tables MHR 45
46You can infer the number  of valence  electrons  in any main-group
element  from its group number.  For example,  Group 1 (IA) elements  have
one valence  electron.  Group 2 (IIA) elements  have two valence  electrons.
For elements  in Groups  13 (IIA) to 18 (VIIA),  the number  of valence
electrons  is the same as the second  digit in the current  numbering  system.
It is the same as the only digit in the older numbering  system.  For exam-
ple, elements  in Group 15 (VA) have 5 valence  electrons.  The elements  in
Group 17 (VIIA) have 7 valence  electrons.
Using Lewis Structures  to Represent  Valence  Electrons
It is time-consuming  to draw electron  arrangements  using Bohr-Rutherford
diagrams.  It is much simpler  to use Lewis structures  to represent  elements
and the valence  electrons  of their atoms.  To draw a Lewis structure,  you
replace  the nucleus  and inner energy  levels of an atom with its atomic
symbol.  Then you place dots around  the atomic  symbol  to represent  the
valence  electrons.  The order in which  you place the first four dots
is up to you. You may find it simplest  to start at the top and proceed
clockwise:  right, then bottom,  then left.
Examine  Figure 2.11, and then complete  the Practice  Problems  that
follow.  In Chapter  3, you will use Lewis structures  to help you visualize
what happens  when atoms combine  to form compounds.

The Significance  of a Full Outer Energy  Level
The noble gases in Group 18 (VIIIA)  are the only elements  that exist as
individual  atoms in nature.  They are extremely  unreactive.  They do not
naturally  form compounds  with other atoms. (Scientists  have manipulated
several  of these elements  in the laboratory  to make them react, however.)
What is it about the noble gases that explains  this behaviour?
Recall  that chemical  reactivity  is determined  by valence  electrons.
Thus, there must be something  about the arrangement  of the electrons  in
the noble gases that explains  their unreactivity.  All the noble gases have
outer energy  levels that are completely  filled with the maximum  number
of electrons.  Helium  has a full outer energy  level of two valence  electrons.
The other noble gases have eight valence  electrons  in the outer energy
level. Chemists  reason  that having  a full outer energy  level must be a very
stable electron  arrangement.
What does this stability  mean?  It means that a full outer energy  level
is unlikely  to change.  Scientists  have observed  that, in nature,  situations
or systems  of lower energy  are favoured  over situations  or systems  of
higher  energy.  For example,  a book on a high shelf has more potential
energy  (is less stable) than a book on a lower shelf. If you move a book
from a high shelf to a lower shelf, it has less potential  energy  (is more
stable).  If you move a book to the floor, it has low potential  energy
(is much more stable).
When atoms have eight electrons  in the outer energy  level (or two
electrons  for hydrogen  and helium),  chemists  say that they have a
stable octet. Often this term is shortened  to just octet. An octet is a very
stable electron  arrangement.  As you will see in Chapter  3, an octet is
often the result of changes  in which  atoms combine  to form compounds.
Section  Wrap-up
You have seen that the structure  of the periodic  table is directly  related  to
energy  levels and arrangements  of electrons.  The patterns  that emerge
from this relationship  enable  you to predict  the number  of valence  elec-
trons for any main group element.  They also enable  you to predict  the
number  of energy  levels that an element’s  electrons  occupy.  The relation-
ship between  electrons  and the position  of elements  in the periodic  table
leads to other patterns,  as well. You will examine  several  of these patterns
in the next section.

Periodic  Trends  Involving  the
Sizes and Energy Levels of Atoms
In section  2.1, you learned  that the size of a typical  atom is about 107! m.
You know, however,  that the atoms of each element  are distinctly  differ-
ent. For example,  the atoms of different  elements  have different  numbers
of protons.  This means,  of course,  that they also have different  numbers
of electrons.  You might predict  that the size of an atom is related  to the
number  of protons  and electrons  it has. Is there evidence  to support  this
prediction?  If so, is there a pattern  that can help you predict  the relative
size of an atom for any element  in the periodic  table?
In Investigation  2-A, you will look for a pattern  involving  the size of
atoms. Chemists  define,  and measure,  an atom’s size in terms of its radius.
The radius of an atom is the distance  from its nucleus  to the approximate
outer boundary  of the cloud-like  region  of its electrons.  This boundary  is
approximate  because  atoms are not solid spheres.  They do not have a
fixed outer boundary.
Figure 2.12 represents  how the radius of an atom extends  from its
nucleus  to the approximate  outer boundary  of its electron  cloud. Notice
that the radius  line in this diagram  is just inside  the outer boundary  of the
electron  cloud. An electron  may also spend time beyond  the end of the
radius  line.

radius data for the transition  elements  (not

additional  models,  or draw line or bar graphs,
to verify your expectations.
Trends  for Atomic  Size (Radius)
There are two general  trends for atomic  size:
e As you go down each group in the periodic  table, the size of an atom
increases.  This makes sense if you consider  energy  levels. As you go
down  a group, the valence  electrons  occupy  an energy  level that is
farther  and farther  from the nucleus.  Thus, the valence  electrons  experi-
ence less attraction  for the nucleus.  In addition,  electrons  in the inner
energy  levels block, or shield,  the valence  electrons  from the attraction
of the nucleus.  As a result, the total volume  of the atom, and thus the
size, increases  with each additional  energy  level.
e As you go across a period, the size of an atom decreases.  This trend
might surprise  you at first, since the number  of electrons  increases  as
you go across a period.  You might think that more electrons  would
occupy  more space, making  the atom larger. You might also think that
repulsion  from their like charges  would force the electrons  farther  apart.
The size of an atom decreases,  however,  because  the positive  charge on
the nucleus  also increases  across a period.  As well, without  additional
energy  the electrons  are restricted  to their outer energy  level. For exam-
ple, the outer energy  level for Period 2 elements  is the second  energy
level. Electrons  cannot  move beyond  this energy  level. As a result, the
positive  force exerted  by the nucleus  pulls the outer electrons  closer,
reducing  the atom’s  total size.

A neutral  atom contains  equal numbers  of positive  charges  (protons)  and
negative  charges  (electrons).  The particle  that results  when a neutral  atom
gains electrons  or gives up electrons  is called an ion. Thus, an ion is a
charged  particle.  An atom that gains electrons  becomes  a negatively
charged  anion.  An atom that gives up electrons  becomes  a positively
charged  cation.  Figure 2.14 shows  the formation  of ions for several  ele-
ments.  As you examine  the diagrams,  pay special  attention  to
e the energy  level from which  electrons  are gained  or given up

arrangement  that sodium,  magnesium,  sulfide,  and chloride  ions have?
Try to visualize  the periodic  table as a cylinder,  rather  than  a flat
plane. Can you see a relationship  between  ion formation  and the electron
arrangement  of noble gases?  Examine  Figure 2.14 as well as 2.15 on the
next page. The metals  that are main-group  elements  tend to give up elec-
trons and form ions that have the same number  of electrons  as the nearest
noble gases. Non-metals  tend to gain electrons  and form ions that have
the same number  of electrons  as the nearest  noble gases. For example,
when a sodium  atom gives up its single valence  electron,  it becomes  a
positively  charged  sodium  ion. Its outer electron  arrangement  is like
neon’s outer electron  arrangement.  When  a fluorine  atom gains an
electron,  it becomes  a negatively  charged  ion with an outer electron
arrangement  like that of neon.

a
All elements,  except  hydrogen,
have more than one electron
that can be removed.
Therefore,  they have more
than one ionization  energy.
The energy  that is needed  to
remove  a second  electron  is
called the second  ionization
energy.  The energy  that is
needed  to remove  a third
electron  is the third ionization
energy,  and so on. What  trend
would you expect  to see in the
values of the first, second,  and
third ionization  energies  for
main-group  elements?  What is
your reasoning? )Figure 2.15 can help you determine  the charge  on an ion. Count  the
number  of groups  an ion is from the nearest  noble gas. That number  is
the charge on the ion. For example,  aluminum  is three groups  away
from neon. Thus, an aluminum  ion has a charge of 3+. Sulfur  is two
groups  away from argon. Thus, a sulfide  ion has a charge of 2-.
Remember:  Metals  form positive  ions (cations)  and non-metals  form
negative  ions (anions).
It takes energy  to overcome  the attractive  force of a nucleus  and pull
an electron  away from a neutral  atom. The energy  that is required  to
remove  an electron  from an atom is called ionization  energy.  The bar
graph in Figure 2.16 shows  the ionization  energy  that is needed  to remove
one electron  from the outer energy  level of the atoms of the main-group
elements.  This energy  is called the first ionization  energy.  It is measured
in units of kJ/mol.  A kilojoule  (kJ) is a unit of energy. A mole (mol) is an
amount  of a substance.  (You will learn about the mole in Unit 2.)
As you can see, atoms that give up electrons  easily  have low ioniza-
tion energies.  You would  probably  predict  that the alkali metals  of Group
1 (IA) would  have low ionization  energies.  These elements  are, in fact,
extremely  reactive  because  it takes so little energy  to remove  their single
valence  electron.

Summarizing  Trends  for lonization  Energy
Although  you can see a few exceptions  in Figure 2.16, there are two
general  trends  for ionization  energy:
e Ionization  energy  tends to decrease  down a group. This makes sense in
terms of the energy  level that the valence  electrons  occupy.  Electrons  in
the outer energy  level are farther  from the positive  force of the nucleus.
Thus, they are easier to remove  than electrons  in lower energy  levels.
e Jonization  energy  tends to increase  across  a period.  As you go across a
period,  the attraction  between  the nucleus  and the electrons  in the outer
energy  level increases.  Thus, more energy  is needed  to pull an electron
away from its atom. For this trend to be true, you would expect  a noble
gas to have the highest  ionization  energy  of all the elements  in the same
period.  As you can see in Figure 2.16, they do.
Figure  2.17 summarizes  these general  trends  for ionization  energy.
The Practice  Problems  below  give you a chance  to apply your understand-
ing of these trends.

56Chemistry  Bulletin
At TANCO  in Bernic  Lake, Manitoba,  miners
are busy finding  and processing  two rare and
very different  metallic  elements:  tantalum  and
cesium.  Both of these metals  are important
parts of “high-tech”  applications  around  the
world. They are used in nuclear  reactors  and as
parts of aircraft,  missiles,  camera  lenses,  and
surgical  instruments  like the one shown  above.
Tantalum  is found only in Canada,
Australia,  Brazil,  Zaire, and China. TANCO
(the Tantalum  Mining  Corporation  of Canada)
is the only mine in North America  that pro-
duces tantalum.  TANCO  is also the world’s
main producer  of cesium.  Other than the fact
that tantalum  and cesium  are both found at
TANCO  and both are used in high-tech
applications,  they share little in common.
Tantalum  is a heavy,  hard, and brittle grey
metal. In its pure form, it is extremely  ductile
and can be made into  a fine wire. This has
proved  useful  for making  surgical  sutures.
Another  property  that makes  tantalum  useful is
its resistance  to corrosion  by most acids, due to
its very limited  reactivity.  At normal  tempera-
tures, tantalum  is virtually  non-reactive.  In
fact, tantalum  has about the same resistance  to
corrosion  as glass. Tantalum  can withstand
higher  temperatures  than glass, however.  It has
a melting  point of 3290 K—higher  than the
melting  points of all other elements,  except
MEHR * Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bondingtungsten  and rhenium.  Tantalum’s  resistance
to corrosion  and high melting  point make it
suitable  for use in surgical  equipment  and
implants.  For example,  some of the pins that
are used by surgeons  to hold a patient’s  broken
bones together  are made of tantalum.
Tantalum  is resistant  to corrosion  because  a
thin film of tantalum  oxide forms when tanta-
lum is exposed  to oxygen.  The metal oxide acts
as a protective  layer. The oxide also has special
refractive  properties  that make it ideal for use
in camera  lenses.
Cesium  is quite different  from tantalum,
but it, too, has many high-tech  applications.
Cesium  is a silvery-white  metal. It is found in
a mineral  called pollucite.  Cesium  is the softest
of all the metals  and is a liquid at just above
room temperature.  It is also the most reactive
metal on Earth.
Cesium  has a low ionization  energy.  It
readily  gives up its single valence  electron
to form crystalline  compounds  with all the
halogen  non-metals.  Cesium  is also very
photoelectric.  This means  that it easily gives
up its lone outer electron  when it is exposed
to light. Thus, cesium  is used in television
cameras  and traffic signals.  As well, it has the
potential  to be used in ion propulsion  engines
for travel into deep space.
Making  Connections
1. Make a table to show the differences  and
similarities  between  tantalum  and cesium.
For each metal, add a column  to describe
how its different  properties  make it useful
for specific  applications.
. Bernic  Lake is one of the few locations
where tantulum  can be found.  As well,
it is the most important  cesium  source  in
the world. Research  and describe  what
geographical  conditions  led to the presence
of two such rare metals  in one location.
Trends  for Electron  Affinity
In everyday  conversation,  if you like something,  you may say that you
have an affinity  for it. For example,  what if you enjoy pizza and detest
asparagus?  You may say that you have a high affinity  for pizza and a
low affinity  for asparagus.  If you prefer  asparagus  to pizza, your affinities
are reversed.
Atoms  are not living things,  so they do not like or dislike  anything.
You know, however,  that some atoms have a low attraction  for electrons.
Other atoms have  a greater  attraction  for electrons.  Electron  affinity  is a
measure  of the change  in energy  that occurs  when an electron  is added
to the outer energy  level of an atom to form a negative  ion.
Figure 2.18 identifies  the electron  affinities  of the main-group
elements.  If energy  is released  when an atom of an element  gains an
electron,  the electron  affinity  is expressed  as a negative  integer.  When
energy  is absorbed  when an electron  is added,  electron  affinity  is low, and
is expressed  as a positive  integer.  Notice,  for example,  that fluorine  has
the highest  electron  affinity  (indicated  by a large, negative  integer).  This
indicates  that fluorine  is very likely to be involved  in chemical  reactions.
In fact, fluorine  is the most reactive  of all the elements.
Metals  have very low electron  affinities.  This is especially  true for the
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IJA) elements.  Atoms  of these elements  form stable
positive  ions. A negative  ion that is formed  by the elements  of these
groups  is unstable.  It breaks apart into a neutral  atom and  a free electron.
Examine  Figure 2.18. What trends can you observe?  How regular  are
these trends?

The units for electron  affinity  are the same as
the units for ionization  energy:  kJ/mol.  High negative  numbers
mean a high electron  affinity.  Low negative  numbers  and any
positive  numbers  mean  a low electron  affinity.

Analyzing  the Ice Man’s  Axe
In September  1991, hikers in the Alps Mountains
near the Austrian-lItalian  border  discovered  the
body of a man who had been trapped  in a glacier.
He was almost  perfectly  preserved.  With him was
an assortment  of tools, including  an axe with a
metal blade.
Scientists  were particularly  interested  in the
axe. At first, they believed  that it was bronze,
which is an alloy of copper  and tin. There was a

58complication,  however.  Dating  techniques  that
were used for the clothing  and body suggested
that the “Ice Man” was about 5300 years old.
Bronze  implements  do not appear  in Europe’s  fos-
sil record until about 4000 years ago. Either
Europeans  were using bronze  earlier  than origi-
nally thought,  or the axe was made of a different
material.  Copper  was consistent  with the Ice
Man's age, since it has been used for at least the
past 6000 years.
One technique  to determine  a metal’s  identity
is to dissolve  it in acid. The resulting  solution  is
examined  for evidence  of ions. Scientists  did not
want to damage  the precious  artifact  in any way,
though.
The solution  was an analytical  technique
called X-ray fluorescence.  The object is irradiated
with high-energy  X-ray radiation.  Its atoms
absorb  the radiation,  causing  electrons  from a
lower energy  level to be ejected  from the atom.
This causes  electrons  from an outer energy  level
to “move  in,” to occupy  the vacated  space.  As
the electrons  fall to a less energetic  state, they
emit X-rays.  The electrons  of each atom emit
X-rays  of a particular  wavelength.  Scientists  use
this energy  “signature”  to identify  the atom.
Analysis  by X-ray fluorescence  revealed
that the metal in the blade of the axe was almost
pure copper.

The trends for electron  affinity,  shown  in Figure 2.19, are more
irregular  than the trends for ionization  energy  and atomic  radius.
Nevertheless,  the following  general  trends can be observed:
e Electron  affinity  tends to decrease  down a group. For example,  fluorine
has a higher  electron  affinity  than iodine.
e Electron  affinity  tends to increase  across a period.  For example,  calcium
has a lower electron  affinity  than sulfur.

Section  Wrap-up
Despite  some irregularities  and exceptions,  the following  periodic  trends
summarize  the relationships  among  atomic  size, ionization  energy,  and
electron  affinity:
Trends  for atomic  size are the reverse  of trends for ionization  energy
and electron  affinity.  Larger  atoms tend to have lower ionization
energies  and lower electron  affinities.
Group 16 (VIA) and 17 (VIIA) elements  attract  electrons  strongly.  They
do not give up electrons  readily.  In other words,  they have a strong
tendency  to form negative  ions. Thus, they have high ionization
energies  and high electron  affinities.
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements  give up electrons  readily.  They have
low or no attraction  for electrons.  In other words,  they have a strong
tendency  to form positive  ions. Thus, they have low ionization  energies
and low electron  affinities.
Group 18 (VIIIA) elements  do not attract  electrons  and do not give up
electrons.  In other words,  they do not naturally  form ions. (They are
very stable.)  Thus, they have very high ionization  energies  and very
low electron  affinities.

glowed  in the dark.” The woman  who made
this statement  in the early 1900s was one of
several  factory  workers  who were hired to paint
clock and watch dials with luminous  paint.
This paint glowed  in the dark, because  it con-
tained  radium  (atomic  number  88), which  is
highly  radioactive  and toxic. Marie and Pierre
Curie discovered  radium  in 1898. Chemists

The year was 1896. A chance discovery sent a message echoing from
Yukon’s  Far North to the southern  reaches  of the United  States: “Gold!”
People  migrated  in great numbers  to the Yukon  Territory,  hoping  to make
their fortunes.  Within  two years, these migrants  transformed  a small fish-
ing village  into bustling  Dawson  City—  one of Canada’s  largest  cities at
the time. They also launched  the country’s  first metal-mining  industry.
Gold, like all metals,  is shiny, malleable,  ductile,  and a good conduc-
tor of electricity  and heat. Unlike  most metals  and other elements,  howev-
er, gold is found in nature in its pure form, as an element.  Most elements
are chemically  combined  in the form of compounds.  Why is this so? Why
do atoms of some elements  join together  as compounds,  while others do
not? In this chapter,  you will use the periodic  trends  you examined  in
Chapter  2 to help you answer  these questions.  You will learn about the
bonds that hold elements  together  in compounds.  At the same time, you
will learn how to write chemical  formulas  and how to name compounds.

As you learned  in the chapter  opener,  most elements  do not exist in
nature in their pure form, as elements.  Gold, silver, and platinum  are
three metals  that can be found in Earth’s  crust as elements.  They are
called “precious  metals”  because  this occurrence  is so rare. Most other
metals,  and most other elements,  are found in nature only as compounds.
As the prospectors  in the Yukon  gold rush were searching  for the
element  gold, they were surrounded  by compounds.  The streams  they
panned  for gold ran with water, H,O, a compound  that is essential  to the
survival  of nearly  every organism  on this planet.  To sustain  their energy,
the prospectors  ate food that contained,  among  other things,  starch.
Starch  is a complex  compound  that consists  of carbon,  hydrogen,  and
oxygen.  To flavour  their food, they added sodium  chloride,  NaCl, which
is commonly  called table salt. Sometimes  a compound  called pyrite, also
known  as “fool’s  gold,” tricked  a prospector.  Pyrite (iron disulfide,  FeSz)
looks almost  exactly  like gold, as you can see in Figure 3.1. Pyrite,
however,  will corrode,  and it is not composed  of rare elements.  Thus, it
was not valuable  to a prospector.
66GPETESERI  Prospectors  used the physical  properties  of gold and pyrite to distinguish
between  them. Can you tell which of these photos  shows  gold and which shows pyrite?
There are only about 90 naturally  occurring  elements.  In comparison,
there are thousands  upon thousands  of different  compounds  in nature,
and more are constantly  being discovered.  Elements  combine  in many
different  ways to form the astonishing  variety  of natural  and synthetic
compounds  that you see and use every day.

Table Salt: An lonic Compound .
Sodium  chloride,  NaCl, is a familiar  compound.  You know it as table salt.
The sodium  in sodium  chloride  plays a vital role in body functions.  We
need to ingest about 500 mg of sodium  a day. Too much sodium  chloride,
however,  may contribute  to high blood pressure.  In the winter,  sodium
chloride  is put on roads and sidewalks  to melt the ice, as shown  in
Figure 3.2. Although  this use of sodium  chloride  increases  the safety of
pedestrians  and drivers,  there are several  drawbacks.  For example,  the
saltwater  discolours  and damages  footwear,  and it corrodes  the metal
bodies  of cars and trucks.  Also, as shown  in Figure 3.3, deer and moose
that are attracted  to the salt on the roads can be struck  by vehicles.
GEETSE  Sodium  chloride  is
used to melt ice because  salt
water has a lower melting  point
than pure water.
GPtIoE)  This moose was attracted  to the sodium chloride  that was put on the road
to melt snow and ice. Humans,  like most organisms,  need sodium  to maintain  normal
body functions.
Sodium  chloride  is a typical  ionic compound.  Like most ionic com-
pounds,  it is a crystalline  solid at room temperature.  It melts at a very
high temperature,  at 801°C. As well, it dissolves  easily in water. A solu-
tion of sodium  chloride  in water is a good conductor  of electricity.  Liquid
sodium  chloride  is also a good electrical  conductor.
Carbon Dioxide:  A Covalent  Compound
The cells of most organisms  produce  carbon  dioxide,  CO2,
during  cellular  respiration:  the process  that releases  energy
from food. Plants,  like the ones shown  in Figure 3.4, synthe-
size their own food from carbon  dioxide  and water using
the Sun’s energy.
Carbon  dioxide  has most of the properties  of a typical
covalent  compound.  It has a low melting  point (—79°C).  At
certain  pressures  and temperatures,  carbon  dioxide  is a liq-
uid. Liquid  carbon  dioxide  is a weak conductor  of electricity.
GPT  Plants use carbon dioxide and water to produce  their own
food, using the Sun's energy.

Do you think that water is a
covalent  compound  or an
ionic compound?  List water's
physical  properties.  Can
you tell whether  water is a
covalent  compound  or an
ionic compound  based only
on its physical  properties?
Why or why not?Carbon  dioxide  is somewhat  soluble  in water, especially  at high pressures.
This is why soft drinks are bottled  under pressure.  When  you open a
bottle of pop, some of the carbon  dioxide  comes out of solution.  Often,
this happens  too quickly,  as you can see in Figure 3.5. A solution  of
carbon  dioxide  in water is a weak conductor  of electricity.
What Is Bonding?
Why are carbon  dioxide  and sodium  chloride  so different?  Why can we
divide compounds  into two categories  that display  distinct  physical
properties?  The answers  come from an understanding  of chemical  bonds:
the forces that attract  atoms to each other in compounds.  Bonding
involves  the interaction  between  the valence  electrons  of atoms.  Usually
the formation  of a bond between  two atoms creates a compound  that is
more stable than either of the two atoms on their own.
The different  properties  of ionic and covalent  compounds  result from
the manner  in which  chemical  bonds form between  atoms in these com-
pounds.  Atoms can either exchange  or share electrons.
When two atoms exchange  electrons,  one atom loses its valence
electron(s)  and the other atom gains the electron(s).  This kind of bonding
usually  occurs  between  a metal and a non-metal.  Recall,  from Chapter  2,
that metals  have low ionization  energies  and non-metals  have high elec-
tron affinities.  That is, metals  tend to lose electrons  and non-metals  tend
to gain them. When atoms exchange  electrons,  they form an ionic bond.
Atoms  can also share electrons.  This kind of bond forms between  two
non-metals.  It can also form between  a metal and a non-metal  when the
metal has a fairly high ionization  energy. When atoms share electrons,
they  form a covalent  bond.
How can you determine  whether  the bonds  that hold a compound
together  are ionic or covalent?  Examining  the physical  properties  of
the compound  is one method.  This method  is not always  satisfactory,
however.  Often a compound  has some ionic characteristics  and some
covalent  characteristics.  You saw this in the previous  Thought  Lab.
For example,  hydrogen  chloride,  also known  as hydrochloric  acid, has
a low melting  point and a low boiling  point. (It is a gas at room tempera-
ture.) These properties  might lead you to believe  that hydrogen  chloride  is
a covalent  compound.  Hydrogen  chloride,  however,  is extremely  soluble
in water, and the water solution  conducts  electricity.  These properties  are
characteristic  of an ionic compound.  Is there a clear, theoretical  way to
decide  whether  the bond between  hydrogen  and chlorine  is ionic or
covalent?  The answer  lies in a periodic  trend.
Electronegativity:  Attracting  Electrons
When two atoms  form a bond, each atom attracts  the other atom’s
electrons  in addition  to its own. The electronegativity  of an atom is a
measure  of an atom’s ability  to attract  electrons  in a chemical  bond. EN
is used to symbolize  electronegativity.  There is a specific  electronegativity
associated  with each element.
As you can see in Figure 3.6, electronegativity  is a periodic  property,
just as atomic  size, ionization  energy,  and electron  affinity  are. Atomic
size, ionization  energy,  and electron  affinity,  however,  are properties  of
single atoms. In contrast,  electronegativity  is a property  of atoms that are
involved  in chemical  bonding.
70 = =MHR-* Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Electronegativities
The trend for electronegativity  is the reverse  of the trend for atomic  size.
Examine  Figure 3.7, on the next page, to see what this means.  In general,
as atomic  size decreases  from left to right across a period,  electronegativi-
ty increases.  Why? The number  of protons  (which  attract  electrons)  in the
nucleus  increases.  At the same time, the number  of filled, inner electron
energy  levels (which  shield the protons  from valence  electrons)  remains
the same. Thus the electrons  are pulled  more tightly  to the nucleus,
resulting  in a smaller  atomic  size. The atom attracts  a bonding  pair of
electrons  more strongly,  because  the bonding  pair can move closer to
the nucleus.
In the second  period,  for example,  lithium  has the largest  atomic
size and the lowest  electronegativity.  As atomic  size decreases  across  the
second  period,  the electronegativity  increases.  Fluorine  has the smallest
atomic  size in the third period  (except  for neon) and the highest  elec-
tronegativity.  Because  noble gases do not usually  participate  in bonding,
their electronegativities  are not given.
Similarly,  as atomic  size increases  down a group, electronegativity
decreases.  As you move down  a group,  valence  electrons  are less strongly
attracted  to the nucleus  because  the number  of filled electron  energy
levels between  the nucleus  and the valence  electrons  increases.  In a
compound,  increasing  energy  levels between  valence  electrons  and the
nucleus  mean that the nucleus  attracts  bonding  pairs less strongly.
For example,  in Group 2 (IIA), beryllium  has the smallest  atomic
radius  and the largest  electronegativity.  As atomic  size increases  down
the group, electronegativity  decreases.
Figure 3.7 shows the relationship  between  atomic  size and electro-
negativity  for the main-group  elements  in periods  2 to 6.GEISER  Electronegativity  is
a periodic  trend. It increases  up
a group and across  a period.

Predicting  Bond Type Using Electronegativity
You can use the differences  between  electronegativities  to decide whether
the bond between  two atoms is ionic or covalent.  The symbol  AEN stands
for the difference  between  two electronegativity  values. When calculating
the electronegativity  difference,  the smaller  electronegativity  is always
subtracted  from the larger electronegativity,  so that the electronegativity
difference  is always  positive.
How can the electronegativity  difference  help you predict  the type of
bond? By the end of this section,  you will understand  the aswer to this
question.  Consider  three different  substances:  potassium  fluoride,  KF,
oxygen,  Oz, and hydrochloric  acid, HCI. Potassium  fluoride  is an ionic
compound  made up of a metal and a non-metal  that have very different
electronegativities.  Potassium’s  electronegativity  is 0.82. Fluorine’s
electronegativity  is 3.98. Therefore,  AEN for the bond between  potassium
and fluorine  is 3.16.
Now consider  oxygen.  This element  exists as units of two atoms held
together  by covalent  bonds. Each oxygen  atom has an electronegativity  of
3.44. The bond that holds the oxygen  atoms together  has an electronega-
tivity difference  of 0.00 because  each atom in an oxygen  molecule  has an
equal attraction  for the bonding  pair of electrons.
Finally,  consider  hydrogen  chloride,  or hydrochloric  acid. Hydrogen
has an electronegativity  of 2.20, and chlorine  has an electronegativity  of
3.16. Therefore,  the electronegativity  difference  for the chemical  bond in
hydrochloric  acid, HCl, is 0.96. Hydrogen  chloride  is a gas at room tem-
perature,  but its water solution  conducts  electricity.  Is hydrogen  chloride
a covalent  compound  or an ionic compound?  Its AEN can help you
decide,  as you will see below.
72 MHR- Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
The Range of Electronegativity  Differences
When two atoms have electronegativities  that are identical,  as in oxygen,
they share their bonding  pair of electrons  equally  between  them in a
covalent  bond. When two atoms have electronegativities  that are very dif-
ferent, as in potassium  fluoride,  the atom with the lower electronegativity
loses an electron  to the atom with the higher  electronegativity.  In
potassium  fluoride,  potassium  gives up its valence  electron  to fluorine.
Therefore,  the bond is ionic.
It is not always  clear whether  atoms share electrons  or transfer  them.
Atoms  with different  electronegativities  can share electrons  unequally
without  exchanging  them. How unequal  does the sharing  have to be
before  the bond is considered  ionic?
Figure 3.8 shows  the range of electronegativity  differences.  These
values  go from mostly  covalent  at 0.0 to mostly  ionic at 3.3. Chemists
consider  bonds  with an electronegativity  difference  that is greater  than
1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity  difference  that is less
than 1.7 to be covalent.

Section  Wrap-up
In this section,  you learned  that most elements  do not exist in their pure
form in nature.  Rather,  they exist as different  compounds.  You reviewed
the characteristic  properties  of ionic and covalent  compounds.  You
considered  the periodic  nature of electronegativity,  and you learned  how
to use the electronegativity  difference  to predict  the type of bond. You
learned,  for example,  that ionic bonds form between  two atoms with very
different  electronegativities.
In section  3.2, you will explore  ionic and covalent  bonding  in terms
of electron  transfer  and sharing.  You will use your understanding  of
the nature of bonding  to explain  some properties  of ionic and covalent
compounds.

Ionic and Covalent
Bonding:  The Octet Rule
In section  3.1, you reviewed  your understanding  of the physical  proper-
ties of covalent  and ionic compounds.  You learned  how to distinguish
between  an ionic bond and a covalent  bond based on the difference
between  the electronegativities  of the atoms. By considering  what
happens  to electrons  when atoms form bonds,  you will be able to explain
some of the characteristic  properties  of ionic and covalent  compounds.
The Octet Rule
Why do atoms form bonds?  When atoms are bonded  together,  they are
often more stable. We know that noble gases are the most stable elements
in the periodic  table. What evidence  do we have? The noble gases are
extremely  unreactive.  They do not tend to form compounds.  What do the
noble gases have in common?  They have  a filled outer electron  energy
level. When  an atom loses, gains, or shares electrons  through  bonding
to achieve  a filled outer electron  energy  level, the resulting  compound
is often very stable.
According  to the octet rule, atoms bond in order to achieve  an
electron  configuration  that is the same as the electron  configuration  of a
noble gas. When  two atoms or ions have the same electron  configuration,
they are said to be isoelectronic  with one another.  For example,  Cl” is
isoelectronic  with Ar because  both have 18 electrons  and  a filled outer
energy  level. This rule is called the octet rule because  all the noble gases
(except  helium)  have eight electrons  in their filled outer energy  level.
(Recall  that helium’s  outer electron  energy  level contains  only two
electrons.)
lonic Bonding
In Section  3.1 you learned  that the electronegativity
difference  for the bond between  sodium  and chlorine
is 2.1. Thus, the bond is an ionic bond. Sodium  has a
very low electronegativity,  and chlorine  has a very
high electronegativity.  Therefore,  when sodium  and
chlorine  interact,  sodium  transfers  its valence  electron
to chlorine.  As shown  in Figure 3.9, sodium  becomes
Na* and chlorine  becomes  CI.
How does the formation  of an ionic bond between
sodium  and chlorine  reflect  the octet rule? Neutral
sodium  has one valence  electron.  When it loses this
electron  to chlorine,  the resulting  Na* cation  has an
electron  energy  level that contains  eight electrons.  It
is isoelectronic  with the noble gas neon. On the other
hand, chlorine  has an outer electron  energy  level that
contains  seven electrons.  When chlorine  gains sodium’s

bond(GEESE)  Sodium’s  electron  is transferred  to chlorine.  The atoms

are oppositely  charged,  they are strongly  attracted  to one another.3.2

When you draw Lewis struc-
tures to show the formation
of a bond, you can use differ-
ent colours  or symbols  to
represent  the electrons  from
different  atoms. For example,
use an “x” for an electron  from
sodium,  and an “o” for an
electron  from chlorine.  Or, use
open and closed cirlces as is
shown here. This will make it
easierto see how the elec-
| rats have been transferred.PROBLEM  TIPelectron,  it becomes  an anion that is isoelectronic  with the noble gas
argon. As you can see in Figure 3.10, you can represent  the formation  of
an ionic bond using Lewis structures.
Thus, in an ionic bond, electrons  are transferred  from one atom to
another  so that they form oppositely  charged  ions. The strong force of
attraction  between  the oppositely  charged  ions is what holds them
together.

Transferring  Multiple  Electrons
In sodium  chloride,  NaCl, one electron  is transferred  from sodium  to
chlorine.  In order to satisfy  the octet rule, two or three
electrons  may be transferred  from one atom to another.  For example,
consider  what happens  when magnesium  and oxygen  combine.
The electronegativity  difference  for magnesium  oxide is
3.4—1.3  = 2.1. Therefore,  magnesium  oxide is an ionic compound.
Magnesium  contains  two electrons  in its outer shell. Oxygen  contains
six electrons  in its outer shell. In order to become  isoelectronic  with a
noble gas, magnesium  needs to lose two electrons  and oxygen  needs to
gain two electrons.  Hence,  magnesium  transfers  its two valence  electrons
to oxygen,  as shown  in Figure 3.11. Magnesium  becomes  Mg?*, and
oxygen  becomes  O7.

Metallurgist
Alison Dickson
Alison Dickson  is a metallurgist  at Polaris,  the
world’s  northernmost  mine. Polaris  is located  on
Little Cornwallis  Island in Nunavut.  It is a lead
and zinc mine, operated  by Cominco  Ltd., the
world’s  largest  producer  of zinc concentrate.
After ore is mined at Polaris,  metallurgists
must separate  the valuable  lead- and zinc-bearing
compounds  from the waste or “slag.” First the
ore is crushed  and ground  with water  to produce
flour-like  particles.  Next a process  called flotation
is used to separate  the minerals  from the slag.
In flotation,  chemicals  are added to the metal-
containing  compounds.  The chemicals  react with
the lead and zinc to make them very insoluble  in
water, or hydrophobic.  Air is then bubbled
through  the mineral  and water mixture.  The
hydrophobic  particles  attach to the bubbles  and
float to the surface.  They form  a stable  froth, or
concentrate,  which is collected.  The concentrate
is filtered  and dried, and then stored  for
shipment.
Dickson  says that she decided  on metallurgy
as a career  because  she wanted  to do somethingthat was “hands-on.”  After completing  her sec-
ondary  education  in Malaysia,  where she
grew up, Dickson  moved  to Canada.  She studied
mining  and mineral  process  engineering  at the
University  of British Columbia.
Dickson  says that she also wanted  to do
something  adventurous.  She wanted  to travel and
live in different  cultures.  As a summer  student,
Dickson  worked  at a Chilean  copper  mine. Her
current  job with Cominco  involves  frequent  travel
to various  mines. “Every  day provides  a new
challenge,”  Dickson  says. When she Is at Polaris,
Dickson  enjoys polar bear sightings  on the tundra.

lonic Bonding  That Involves  More Than Two lons
Sometimes  ionic compounds  contain  more than one atom of each ele-
ment. For example,  consider  the compound  that is formed  from calcium
and fluorine.  Because  the electronegativity  difference  between  calcium
and fluorine  is 3.0, you know that a bond between  calcium  and fluorine
is ionic. Calcium  has two electrons  in its outer energy  level, so it needs
to lose two electrons  according  to the octet rule. Fluorine  has seven elec-
trons in its outer energy  level, so it needs to gain one electron,  again
according  to the octet rule. How do the electrons  of these elements
interact  so that each element  achieves  a filled outer energy  level?

Explaining  the Conductivity  of lonic Compounds
Now that you understand  the nature of the bonds in ionic compounds,
can you explain  some of their properties?  Consider  electrical  conductivity.
Ionic compounds  do not conduct  electricity  in their solid state. They are
very good conductors  in their liquid state, however,  or when they are dis-
solved in water. To explain  these properties,  ask yourself  two questions:
1. What is required  for electrical  conductivity?
2. What is the structure  of ionic compounds  in the liquid, solid, and
dissolved  states?
An electrical  current  can flow only if charged  particles  are available  to
move and carry the current.  Consider  sodium  chloride  as an example.  Is
there a mobile charge in solid sodium  chloride?  No, there is not. In the
solid state, sodium  and chlorine  ions are bonded  to each other by strong
ionic bonds. Like all solid-state  ionic compounds,  the ions are arranged
in a rigid lattice formation,  as shown  in Figure 3.13.
78 = MHR-* Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
In the solid state, the ions cannot  move very much. Thus, there is no
mobile  charge.  Solid sodium  chloride  does not conduct  electricity.

You are probably  familiar  with the ionic crystals  in caves. Stalagmites  and
stalactites  are crystal  columns  that form when water, containing  dissolved
lime, drips very slowly  from the ceiling  of a cave onto the floor below.
How do these ionic crystals  grow?
When  a clear solution  of an ionic compound  is poured  over a seed
crystal  of the same compound,  the ions align themselves  according  to
the geometric  arrangement  in the seed crystal.  You will observe  this for
yourself  in Investigation  3-A.

Covalent  Bonding
You have learned  what happens  when the electronegativity  difference
between  two atoms is greater  than 1.7. The atom with the lower elec-
tronegativity  transfers  its valence  electron(s)  to the atom with the higher
electronegativity.  The resulting  ions have opposite  charges.  They are held
together  by a strong ionic bond.
What happens  when the electronegativity  difference  is very small?
What happens  when the electronegativity  difference  is zero? As an exam-
ple, consider  chlorine.  Chlorine  is a yellowish,  noxious  gas. What is it like
at the atomic  level? Each chlorine  atom has seven electrons  in its outer
energy  level. In order for chlorine  to achieve  the electron  configuration  of
a noble gas according  to the octet rule, it needs to gain one electron.  When
two chlorine  atoms bond together,  their electronegativity  difference  is
zero. The electrons  are equally  attracted  to each atom.
Therefore,  instead  of transferring  electrons,  the two atoms each share
one electron  with each other. In other words,  each atom contributes  one
electron  to a covalent  bond. A covalent  bond consists  of a pair of shared
electrons.  Thus, each chlorine  atom achieves  a filled outer electron  energy
level, satisfying  the octet rule. Examine  Figure 3.15 to see how to repre-
sent a covalent  bond with a Lewis structure.
When two atoms of the same element  form a bond, they share their
electrons  equally  in a pure covalent  bond. Elements  with atoms that bond
to each other in this way are known  as diatomic  elements.
When atoms such as carbon  and hydrogen  bond to each other, their
electronegativities  are so close that they share their electrons  almost
equally.  Carbon  and hydrogen  have an electronegativity  difference  of only
2.6 — 2.2 = 0.4. In Figure 3.16, you can see how one atom of carbon  forms
a covalent  bond with four atoms of hydrogen.  The compound  methane,
CH,, is formed.
Each hydrogen  atom shares one of its electrons  with the carbon.  The
carbon  shares one of its four valence  electrons  with each hydrogen.  Thus,
each hydrogen  atom achieves  a filled outer energy  level, and so does
carbon.  (Recall  that elements  in the first period  need only two electrons
to fill their outer energy  level.) When analyzing  Lewis structures  that show
covalent  bonds, count the shared  electrons  as if they belong  to each of the
bonding  atoms. In the following  Practice  Problems,  you will represent
covalent  bonding  using Lewis structures.

| Gtais in the usual way.Multiple  Covalent  Bonds
Atoms sometimes  transfer  more than one electron  in ionic bonding.
Similarly,  in covalent  bonding,  atoms sometimes  need to share two or
three pairs of electrons,  according  to the octet rule. For example,  consider
the familiar  diatomic  element  oxygen.  Each oxygen  atom has six electrons
in its outer energy  level. Therefore,  each atom requires  two additional
electrons  to achieve  a stable octet. When two oxygen  atoms form a bond,
they share two pairs of electrons,  as shown  in Figure 3.17. This kind of
covalent  bond is called a double  bond.
Double  bonds can form between  different  elements,  as well. For
example,  consider  what happens  when carbon  bonds  to oxygen  in carbon
dioxide.  To achieve  a stable octet, carbon  requires  four electrons,  and
oxygen  requires  two electrons.  Hence,  two atoms of oxygen  bond to one
atom of carbon.  Each oxygen  forms a double  bond with the carbon,  as
shown  in Figure 3.18.
When atoms share three pairs of electrons,  they form  a triple bond.
Diatomic  nitrogen  contains  a triple bond, as you can see in Figure 3.19.

Explaining  the Low Conductivity  of Covalent  Compounds
Covalent  compounds  have a wider variety  of properties  than ionic
compounds.  Some dissolve  in water, and some do not. Some conduct
electricity  when molten  or dissolved  in water, and some do not. If you
consider  only covalent  compounds  that contain  bonds with an electroneg-
ativity  difference  that is less than 0.5, you will notice greater  consistency.
For example,  consider  the compounds  carbon  disulfide,  CS2, dichlorine
monoxide,  Cl,O, and carbon  tetrachloride,  CCl,. What are some of the
properties  of these compounds?  They all have low boiling  points.  None of
them conducts  electricity  in the solid, liquid, or gaseous  state.
How do we explain  the low conductivity  of these pure covalent
compounds?  The atoms in each compound  are held together  by strong
covalent  bonds.  Whether  the compound  is in the liquid, solid, or gaseous
state, these bonds do not break. Thus, covalent  compounds  (unlike  ionic
compounds)  do not break up into ions when they melt or boil. Instead,
their atoms remain  bonded  together  as molecules.  For this reason,  cova-
lent compounds  are also called  molecular  compounds.  The molecules
that make up a pure covalent  compound  cannot  carry a current,  even if
the compound  is in its liquid state or in solution.
82 MHR-* Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Evidence  for Intermolecular  Forces
You have learned  that pure covalent  compounds  are not
held together  by ionic bonds in lattice structures.  They do
form liquids  and solids at low temperatures,  however.
Something  must hold the molecules  together  when a
covalent  compound  is in its liquid or solid state. The forces
that bond the atoms  to each other within  a molecule  are
called intramolecular  forces. Covalent  bonds are intramole-
cular forces.  In comparison,  the forces that bond molecules
to each other are called intermolecular  forces.
You can see the difference  between  intermolecular
forces and intramolecular  forces in Figure 3.20. Because
pure covalent  compounds  have low melting  and boiling
points,  you know that the intermolecular  forces must be
very weak compared  with the intramolecular  forces.  It does
not take very much energy  to break the bonds that hold the
molecules  to each other.
There are several  different  types of intermolecular
forces. You will learn more about them in section  3.3, as
well as in Chapters  8 and 11.

Relatively  weak intermolecular  forces  act between

In this chapter,  you have seen that non-metals  tend to form ionic
bonds with metals.  Non-metals  tend to form covalent  bonds with other
non-metals  and with themselves.  How do metals  bond to each other?
We know that elements  that tend to form ionic bonds have very
different  electronegativities.  Metals  bonding  to themselves  or to other
metals do not have electronegativity  differences  that are greater  than 1.7.
Therefore,  metals  probably  do not form ionic bonds with each other.
Evidence  bears this out. A pure metal, such as sodium,  is soft enough
to be cut with a butter  knife. Other pure metals,  such as copper  or gold,
can be drawn  into wires or hammered  into sheets.  Ionic
compounds,  by contrast,  are hard and brittle.
Do metals  form covalent  bonds with each other? No.
They do not have enough  valence  electrons  to achieve
stable octets by sharing  electrons.  Although  metals do not
form covalent  bonds,  however,  they do share their electrons.
In metallic  bonding,  atoms release  their electrons  to a
shared  pool of electrons.  You can think of a metal as a non-
rigid arrangement  of metal ions in a sea of free electrons,
as shown  in Figure 3.21. The force that holds metal atoms
together  is called a metallic  bond. Unlike  ionic or covalent
bonding,  metallic  bonding  does not have a particular  orien-
tation in space. Because  the electrons  are free to move, the
metal ions are not rigidly  held in a lattice formation.
Therefore,  when a hammer  pounds  metal, the atoms can
slide past one another.  This explains  why metals can be
easily hammered  into sheets.

When  two bonding  atoms have an electronegativity  difference  that is
greater  than 0.5 but less than 1.7, they are considered  to be a particular
type of covalent  bond called a polar covalent  bond. In a polar covalent
bond, the atoms have significantly  different  electronegativities.  The
electronegativity  difference  is not great enough,  however,  for the less
electronegative  atom to transfer  its valence  electrons  to the other, more
electronegative  atom. The difference  is great enough  for the bonding
electron  pair to spend  more time near the more electronegative  atom than
the less electronegative  atom.
For example,  the bond between  oxygen  and hydrogen  in water has
an electronegativity  difference  of 1.24. Because  this value falls between
0.5 and 1.7, the bond is a polar covalent  bond. The oxygen  attracts  the
electrons  more strongly  than the hydrogen.  Therefore,  the oxygen  has a
slightly  negative  charge  and the hydrogen  has a slightly  positive  charge.
Since the hydrogen  does not completely  transfer  its electron  to the oxy-
gen, their respective  charges  are not +1 and —1, but rather  6* and 5. The
symbol  5* (delta plus) stands for a partial  positive  charge.  The symbol
6 (delta minus)  stands  for a partial  negative  charge.  Figure 3.24 illustrates
the partial  negative  and positive  charges  across an oxygen-hydrogen  bond.

to a third atom of another  element.  According  to Figure 3.26, however,
water and carbon  dioxide  molecules  are different  shapes.  Why does
carbon  dioxide  have a linear shape while water is bent?

ait: Ce Two non-bending
pairs account  for water's  bent
shape.To understand  why molecules  have different  shapes,  consider  how
electron  arrangement  affects  shape. The Lewis structure  for water, for
example,  shows  that the oxygen  is surrounded  by four electron  pairs. As
shown  in figure 3.26, two of the pairs are involved  in bonding  with the
hydrogen  atoms and two of the pairs are not. Electron  pairs that are not
involved  in bonding  are called lone pairs. Electron  pairs that are involved
in bonding  are called  bonding  pairs.
Electron  pairs are arranged  around  molecules  so that they are a maxi-
mum distance  from each other. This makes sense, because  electrons  are
negatively  charged  and they repel each other. The shape that allows  four
electron  pairs to be a maximum  distance  from each other around  an atom
is a tetrahedron.  Figure 3.27 shows a tetrahedron.
The Shape of a Water Molecule
In a water molecule,  there are four electron  pairs around  the oxygen  atom.
Two of these pairs bond with the hydrogen.  The electron  pairs are
arranged  in a shape that is nearly  tetrahedral.  When  you draw the
molecule,  however,  you draw only the oxygen  atom and the two hydrogen
atoms. This is where the bent shape comes from, as you can see in
Figure 3.28.
The Shape of a Carbon Dioxide  Molecule
Now consider  carbon  dioxide,  CO. Why does a carbon  dioxide  molecule
have a linear shape?  Examine  the Lewis structure  for carbon  dioxide.  The
central  carbon  atom is surrounded  by eight electrons  (four pairs), like the
oxygen  atom in a water molecule.  In a carbon  dioxide  molecule,  though,
all the electrons  are involved  in bonding.  There are no lone pairs. Because
the bonding  electrons  spend most of their time between  the carbon  and
oxygen  atoms,  they are arranged  in a straight  line. This allows  them to be
as far away from each other as possible,  as you can see in Figure 3.29.

The shapes  of the water molecule  and the

what we know about electron  pairs. These
shapes  have also been supported  by experi-
ment. You will learn more about experimental

Drawing  the Lewis structure  of a molecule
can help you determine  the molecule’s  shape.
In Figure 3.30, you can see the shape of the
ammonia,  NH3, molecule.  The ammonia
molecule  has three bonding  electron  pairs and
one lone pair on its central  atom, all arranged
in a nearly  tetrahedral  shape. Because  there is
one lone pair, the molecule’s  shape is pyrami-
dal. The molecule  methane,  CH,, is shown  in
Figure 3.31. This molecule  has four bonding
pairs on its central  atom and no lone pairs.
It is shaped  like a perfectly  symmetrical

Dr. Geoffrey  Ozin
His work has flown on a Space Shuttle,  and it has
been hailed as art. It may well be part of the next
computing  revolution.
What does Dr. Geoffrey  Ozin do? As little as
possible,  for he believes  in letting the atoms do
most of the work. This approach  has made him
one of the more celebrated  chemists  in Canada.
Time and again, he has brought  together  organic
and inorganic  molecules,  polymers,  and metals  in
order to create materials  with just the right struc-
ture for a specific  purpose.
Self-assembly  is the key. Atoms  and
molecules  are driven into pre-designed  shapes
by intermolecular  forces and geometricalconstraints.  At the University  of Toronto,  Dr. Ozin
teaches  his students  the new science  of inten-
tional design,  instead  of the old trial-and-error
methods.
Born in London,  England,  in 1943, Geoffrey
Ozin earned a doctorate  in chemistry  at Oxford
University.  He joined  the University  of Toronto
in 1969. Ozin’s father  was  a tailor. In a way, Ozin
is continuing  the family  tradition.  Ozin, however,
uses ionic and covalent  bonds,  atoms and
molecules,  acids, gases, and solutions  to fashion
his creations.
In 1996, Dr. Ozin demonstrated  the
self-assembly  of crystals  with a porous
structure  in space, under  the conditions  (such as
microgravity)  found aboard  a Space Shuttle.
Since then, he has shown how the self-assembly
of many materials  can be controlled  to produce
their structure.
Dr. Ozin's latest achievement  involves
structure.  Ozin was part of an international
research  team that created  regular  microscopic
cavities  inside a piece of silicon.  This material
can transmit  light photons  in precisely  regulated
ways. In the future,  this material  might be used
to build incredibly  fast computers  that function
by means  of photons  instead  of electrons!

Polar Bonds and Molecular  Shapes
Water  molecules  are attracted  to one another.  Because  we are surrounded
by water, we are surrounded  by evidence  of this attraction.  Re-examine
the water skier in Figure 3.22. If water molecules  did not attract  one
another,  do you think the spray from the ski would  form a “sheet”  as
shown?  Try filling a glass with water. As you near the rim, add water very
slowly.  If you are careful,  you can fill the glass so that the water  bulges
over the rim. After a rainfall,  you have probably  seen beads of water on
the surface  of vehicles.  In Figure 3.32, you can see further  evidence  of
the attraction  of water molecules  to one another.
Why do water molecules  “stick together”?  To answer  this question,
you need to consider  both the nature of the bonds within  a water
molecule  and its shape.
GETESESI  The shape of water
droplets  is evidence  that water
molecules  are attracted  to one
another.  This property  of water
can be explained  by the polarity
of its O—H bonds.
The Polar Water  Molecule
First consider  the shape of a water molecule.  You have discovered  that
a water molecule  has a bent shape. Each oxygen-hydrogen  bond is polar.
The hydrogen  atom has a partial  positive  charge  and the oxygen  atom has
a partial  negative  charge.  You know that the bonds are polar, but what
about the molecule  as a whole?  Because  the molecule  is bent, there is a
partial  negative  charge  on the oxygen  end and  a partial  positive  charge
on the hydrogen  end, as shown  in Figure 3.33.

Because  the water molecule  as a whole  has a partial  negative  charge  on

molecule.  Because  water is polar, its negative  and positive  ends attract
each other. This explains  why liquid water “sticks”  to itself. Figure 3.34

Two other examples  of polar molecules  are ammonia  and hydrogen

dipolar  molecules  because  they have a negative  pole and a positive  pole.
The Non-Polar  Carbon  Dioxide  Molecule
The bond between  carbon  and oxygen  is polar. It has an electronegativity
difference  of 1.0. Does this mean that carbon  dioxide,  a molecule  that

Writing  Chemical  Formulas  and
Naming  Chemical  Compounds
You have used Lewis structures  to demonstrate  how ionic and covalent
bonds form between  atoms. When given two elements,  you determined
how many atoms of each element  bond together  to form a compound,
according  to the octet rule. For example,  you used the periodic  table and
your understanding  of the octet rule to determine  how calcium  and
bromine  bond to form an ionic compound.  Using a Lewis structure,  you
determined  that calcium  and bromine  form a compound  that contains
two bromine  atoms for every calcium  atom, as shown  in Figure 3.39.
Chemical  Formulas
Lewis structures  are helpful  for keeping  track of electron  transfers  in
bonding  and for making  sure that the octet rule is obeyed.  As well,
Lewis structures  can be used to help determine  the ratio of the atoms in
a compound.  To communicate  this ratio, chemists  use a special  kind of
shorthand  called a chemical  formula.  A chemical  formula  provides  two
important  pieces of information:
1. the elements  that make up the compound
2. the number  of atoms of each element  that are present  in a compound
The order in which  the elements  are written  also communicates  important
information.  The less electronegative  element  or ion is usually  listed first
in the formula,  and the more electronegative  element  or ion comes sec-
ond. For example,  the ionic compound  that is formed  from calcium  and
bromine  is written  CaBr,. Calcium,  a metal with low electronegativity,  is
written  first. The subscript  2 after the bromine  indicates  that there are two
bromine  atoms for every calcium  atom.

What does the formula  of
calcium  bromide  represent?What a Chemical  Formula  Represents
For covalent  compounds,  the chemical  formula  represents  how many of
each type of atom are in each molecule.  For example,  the formula  NH;
signifies  that a molecule  of ammonia  contains  one nitrogen  atom and
three hydrogen  atoms. The formula  C,H, tells you that a molecule  of
propane  contains  two atoms of carbon  and six atoms of hydrogen.
For ionic compounds,  the formula  represents  a ratio rather  than
a discrete  particle.  For example,  the formula  for magnesium  oxide, MgO,
signifies  that magnesium  and oxygen  exist in a one-to-one  atomic  ratio.
Recall that MgO exists in a lattice structure  held together  by ionic bonds,
as shown  in Figure 3.41. The formula  MgO represents  the ratio in which
ions are present  in the compound.
Using Valence  Numbers  to Describe  Bonding  Capacity

covalent,  and polar covalent  compounds.  When you draw a Lewis
structure,  you can count how many electrons  are needed  by each atom
to achieve  a stable octet. Thus, you can find out the ratio in which  the
atoms combine.  Once you know the ratio of the atoms, you can write the
chemical  formula  of the compound.  Drawing  Lewis structures  can become
overwhelming,  however,  when you are dealing  with large molecules.  Is
there a faster and easier method  for writing  chemical  formulas?
Every element  has a certain  capacity  to combine  with other atoms.
An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element,  for example,  has the capacity  to lose
one electron  from its valence  level in order to bond with another  atom.
A number  is assigned  to each element  to describe  the element’s  bonding
capacity.  This number  is called  the valence.  Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements,
such as sodium  and lithium,  have a valence  of +1. The 1 indicates  that
these elements  tend to have one electron  involved  in bonding.  This makes
sense, because  Group 1 elements  have only one electron  in their outer
electron  energy  level. The + indicates  that these elements  tend to give up
their electrons,  becoming  positively  charged  ions. They may transfer  their
electrons,  or they may attract  the electron  relatively  weakly  in a polar
covalent  bond.
On the other hand, Group 17 (VIIA) elements  (the halogens)  have a
valence  of -1. Again,  the 1 indicates  that these elements  tend to have one
electron  involved  in bonding.  However,  they need to gain an electron  to
achieve  a stable octet. In general,  halogens  become  more negatively
charged  when they participate  in bonding.
As a general  rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence  tells
you the charges  on the ions that are formed.  If a covalent  bond is formed,
the valence  tells you how many electrons  the atoms contribute  to the
covalent  bond.
You can use the periodic  table to predict  valence  numbers.  For
example,  Group 2 (IIA) elements  have two electrons  in their outer energy
level. To achieve  a stable octet, they need to lose these two electrons.
Therefore,  the valence  for all Group 2 elements  is +2.

The smaller  atoms of elements  in the first two periods  usually  have only
one common  valence,  which is easily determined  from the periodic  table.
Many larger elements,  however,  have more than one valence  because  the
electron  distribution  in these elements  is much more complex.  Therefore,
you will have to memorize  the valences  of the elements  that are common-
ly used in this course. Some useful valences  are listed in Table 3.3, with
the most common  valences  listed first.

Polyatomic  lons
Some compounds  contain  ions that are made from more than one atom.
These ions are called polyatomic  ions. (The prefix poly means “many.”)
Calcium  carbonate,  CaCO3,  which is found in chalk, contains  one calcium
cation and one polyatomic  anion called carbonate,  CO;7-.
Polyatomic  ions are in fact charged  molecules.  For example,  the car-
bonate ion consists  of one carbon atom covalently  bonded  to three oxygen
atoms. The entire molecule  has a charge of —2. Therefore,  its valence  is —2,
as well. Polyatomic  ions remain  unchanged  in simple chemical  reactions
because  of the strong bonds that hold the component  atoms together.  They
behave as a single unit and should  be treated  as a single ion.
Table 3.4 on the next page gives the valences,  formulas,  and names of
many common  polyatomic  ions.

It is important  to learn the
names and valences  of the five
most common  polyatomic  ions:
nitrate, carbonate,  chlorate,
sulfate,  and phosphate.  These
ions form many of the chemi-
cals in nature and in common
use. While the task seems
overwhelming,  it may help to
learn the “big five” using a
mnemonic,  or memory  aid. You
can use the following
mnemonic  to remember  their
names,  valences,  and number
of oxygen  atoms:
NICK the CAMEL  had a CLAM
for SUPPER  in PHOENIX.
The first letter identifies  the
polyatomic  ion. The number  of
vowels represents  the valence.
The number  of consonants
represents  the number  of oxy-
gen atoms. For example,  NICK
(nitrate)  has three consonants
and one vowel. Therefore,
nitrate contains  three oxygen
atoms and has a valence  of —1.
(All of these valences  are
negative.)
Try to come up with your own
mnemonic.The most common  polyatomic  cation is the ammonium  ion, [NH,*].
The five atoms in NH,* form a particle  with a +1 charge.  Because  the
atoms are bonded  together  strongly,  the polyatomic  ion is not altered  in
most chemical  reactions.  For example,  when ammonium  chloride  is
dissolved  in water, the only ions in the solution  are ammonium  ions and
chloride  ions.

Writing  Chemical  Formulas  Using Valences
You can use valences  to write chemical  formulas.  This method  is faster
than using Lewis structures  to determine  chemical  formulas.  As well,
you can use this method  for both ionic and covalent  compounds.  In order
to write a chemical  formula  using valences,  you need to know which
elements  (or polyatomic  ions) are in the compound,  and their valences.
You also need to know how to use the zero sum rule: For neutral  chemi-
cal formulas  containing  ions, the sum of positive  valences  plus negative
valences  of the atoms  in a compound  must equal zero.
In the compound  potassium  fluoride,  KF, each potassium  ion has a
charge  of +1. Each fluoride  ion has a charge  of —1. Because  there is one of
each ion in the formula,  the sum of the valences  is zero.

What is the formula  of a compound  that consists  of magnesium  and
chlorine?  You know that the valence  of magnesium,  Mg, is +2. The
valence  of chlorine,  Cl, is -1. The formula  MgCl is not balanced,  however,
because  it does not yet obey the zero sum rule. How can you balance  this
formula?  You might  be able to see, at a glance,  that two chlorine  atoms are
needed  for every magnesium  atom. If it is not obvious  how to balance  a
formula,  you can follow  these steps:
1. Write the unbalanced  formula.  Remember  that the metal
is first and the non-metal  is second.

Figure  3.42.
Practice  Problems
How do you write and balance  formulas  that contain  polyatomic  ions?
The same steps can be used, as long as you keep the atoms that belong  to
a polyatomic  ion together.  The easiest  way to do this is to place brackets
around  the polyatomic  ion at the beginning.
For example,  suppose  that you want to write a balanced  formula
for a compound  that contains  potassium  and the phosphate  ion. Use
the following  steps as a guide.16. Write a balanced formula for a compound  that contains )
sulfur and each of the following  elements.  Use a valence

Naming  Chemical  Compounds
When writing  a chemical  formula,  you learned  that you write the metal
element  first. Similarly,  the metal comes first when naming  a chemical
compound.  For example,  sodium  chloride  is formed  from the metal
sodium  and the non-metal  chlorine.  Think of other names  you have seen
in this chapter,  such as beryllium  chloride,  calcium  oxide, and aluminum
oxide. In each case, the metal is first and the non-metal  is second.  In other
words,  the cation is first and the anion is second.  This is just one of the
rules in chemical  nomenclature:  the system  that is used in chemistry  for
naming  compounds.
A chemical  formula  identifies  a specific  chemical  compound  because
it reveals  the composition  of the compound.  Similarly,  the name of a
compound  distinguishes  the compound  from all other compounds.
GPETESEZEY  Many common  chemicals  have trivial, or common,  names.
In the early days of chemistry,  there were no rules for naming  compounds.
Often, compounds  received  the names of people  or places. Some of the
original  names are still used today. They are called trivial or common
names  because  they tell little or nothing  about the chemistry  of the
compounds.  For example,  potassium  nitrate,  KNO3, is commonly  known
as saltpetre.  The Greek  word for rock is petra, and saltpetre  is a salt found
crusted  on rocks. The chemical  name of a compound  of ammonium  and
chloride  ions, is ammonium  chloride  NH,Cl.  Long before  NH.Cl received
this name, however,  people  commonly  referred  to it as sal ammoniac.
They mined  this ionic compound  near the ancient  Egyptian  temple  of
Ammon  in Libya. The name sal ammoniac  literally  means “salt of
Ammon.”  Figure 3.43 shows other examples  of common  (trivial)  names
for familiar  compounds.
Early chemists  routinely  gave trivial names  to substances  before
understanding  their chemical  structure  and behaviour.  This situation
changed  during  the mid- to late-1800s.  By this time, chemistry  was
firmly established  as a science.  Chemists  observed  and discovered  new
patterns  of chemical  relationships  (such as periodicity).  As well, chemists
discovered  new chemical  compounds  with tremendous  frequency.  The
rapidly  increasing  number  of chemical  compounds  required  a more
organized  method  of nomenclature.
Chapter  3 Chemical  Compounds  and Bonding * MHR_ 101
The International  Union  of Pure and Applied  Chemistry  (IUPAC)  was
formed  in 1919 by a group of chemists.  The main aim of IUPAC  was to
establish  international  standards  for masses,  measurement,  names,  and
symbols  used in the discipline  of chemistry.  To further  that aim, IUPAC
developed,  and continues  to develop,  a consistent  and thorough  system
of nomenclature  for compounds.
Table 3.5 contains  the IUPAC  names of selected  common  compounds
as well as their common  names.

Naming  Binary  Compounds  Containing  a Metal and a Non-metal
A binary  compound  is an inorganic  compound  that contains  two elements.
Binary  compounds  may contain  a metal and a non-metal  or two non-
metals.  Binary  compounds  are often ionic compounds.  To name a binary
ionic compound,  name the cation  first and the anion second.  For example,
the compound  that contains  sodium  and chlorine  is called sodium  chlo-
ride.
In the subsections  that follow,  you will examine  the rules for naming
metals  and non-metals  in binary  compounds.
Naming  Metals  in Chemical  Compounds:  The Stock  System
The less electronegative  element  in a binary  compound  is always  named
first. Often this element  is a metal. You use the same name as the element.
For example,  sodium  chloride,  NaCl, calcium  oxide, CaO, and zinc
sulfide,  ZnS, contain  the metals sodium,  calcium,  and zinc.
Many of the common  metals  are transition  elements  that have more
than one possible  valence.  For example,  tin is able to form the ions Sn?*
and Sn**, iron can form Fe and Fe**, and copper  can form Cut and
Cu2*. (The most common  transition  metals with more than one valence
number  are listed in Table 3.3.) The name of a compound  must identify
which  ion is present  in the compound.  To do this, the element’s  name is
used, followed  by the valence  in parentheses,  written  in Roman  numerals.
Therefore,  Sn** is tin(IV),  Fe** is iron(II),  and Cu** is copper(II).  This
naming  method  is called the Stock system  after Alfred  Stock, a German
chemist  who first used it. Some examples  of Stock system  names  are
listed in Table 3.6.
102 MHR-= Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Another  Method  for Naming  Metals  with Two Valences
In a method  that predates  the Stock system,  two different  endings  are
used to distinguish  the valences  of metals.  The ending  -ic is used to repre-
sent the /arger  valence  number.  The ending  -ous is used to represent
the smaller  valence  number.  Thus, the ions Sn** and Sn** are named
stannous  ion and stannic  ion. To use this system,  you need to know the
Latin name of an element.  For example,  the two ions of lead are the
plumbous  and plumbic  ions. See Table 3.6 for more examples.
This naming  method  has several  drawbacks.  Many metals  have more
than two oxidation  numbers.  For example,  chromium  can form three
different  ions, and manganese  can form five different  ions. Another  draw-
back is that the name does not tell you what the valence  of the metal is.
It only tells you that the valence  is the smaller  or larger of two.
Table 3.6 Two ways to Name Cations  with Two ValencesmindST RET CH;element | ion | Stock system | Alternative  system
copper Cut copper(I) cuprous
Cu** copper(II) cupric
mercury Hg,** mercury(I) mercurous
Hg?* mercury(ID) mercuric
lead Pb?* lead(II) plumbous
Pb** lead(IV) plumbic
Naming  Non-Metals  in Chemical  Compounds
To distinguish  the non-metal  from the metal in the name of a chemical
compound,  the non-metal  (or more electronegative  element)  is always
written  second.  Its ending  changes  to -ide. For example,  hydrogen  changes
to hydride,  carbon  changes  to carbide,  sulfur changes  to sulfide,  and
iodine changes  to iodide.
Putting  It All Together
To name a binary  compound  containing  metal and a non-metal,  write the
name of the metal first and the name of the non-metal  second.  For exam-
ple, a compound  that contains  potassium  as the cation  and bromine  as the
anion is called  potassium  bromide.  Be sure to indicate  the valence  if
necessary,  using the Stock system.  For example,  a compound  that contains
Pb** and oxygen  is called lead(II)  oxide.

pounds  can absorb water

attached  to a specific  number

drate. Can you see the pattern?

Chapter  3 Chemical  Compounds  and Bonding  »* MHR_ 103
Naming  Compounds  That Contain  Hydrogen
If a binary  compound  contains  hydrogen  as the less electronegative
element,  “hydrogen”  is used first in the name of the compound.  For
example,  HCl is called hydrogen  chloride  and H,S is called hydrogen
sulfide.  Sometimes  hydrogen  can be the anion, usually  in a compound
that contains  a Group 1 metal. If hydrogen  is the anion, its ending  must
be changed  to -ide. For example,  NaH is called sodium  hydride  and LiH
is called lithium  hydride.  Hydrogen-containing  compounds  can also be
formed  with the Group 15 elements.  These compounds  are usually
referred  to by their common  names as opposed  to their IUPAC  names.  For
example,  NH; is called ammonia,  PHs is called  phosphine,  AsH3 is called
arsine,  and SbHs is called stibine.
Many compounds  that contain  hydrogen  are also acids. For example,
H2,SO,,  hydrogen  sulfate,  is also called sulfuric  acid. You will learn about
acid nomenclature  in Chapter  10.

Naming  Compounds  That Contain  Polyatomic  lons
Many compounds  contain  one or more polyatomic  ions. Often these
compounds  contain  three elements,  in which  case they are called tertiary
compounds.  Although  they are not binary  compounds,  they still contain
one type of anion and one type of cation. The same naming  rules that
apply to binary  compounds  apply to these compounds  as well. For
example,  NH,Cl is called ammonium  chloride.  NazSOx,  is called sodium
sulfate.  NiSO, is called nickel(II)  sulfate.  NHasNO3  is called ammonium
nitrate.
The non-metals  in the periodic  table are greatly  outnumbered  by the
metals.  There are many negatively  charged  polyatomic  ions, however,
to make up for this. In fact, polyatomic  anions  are commonly  found in
everyday  chemicals.  Refer back to Table 3.4 for the names  of the most
common  polyatomic  anions.
When  you are learning  the names of polyatomic  ions, you will notice
a pattern.  For example,  consider  the polyatomic  ions that contain  chlorine
and oxygen:
ClO- hypochlorite
ClO, chlorite
ClO; chlorate
ClO, — perchlorate
Can you see the pattern?  Each ion has the same valence,  but different
numbers  of oxygen  atoms. The base ion is the one with the “ate” ending
chlorate.  It contains  three oxygen  atoms. When the ending  is changed
to “ite,” subtract  an oxygen  atom from the chlorate  ion. The resulting
chlorite  ion contains  two oxygen  atoms. Add “hypo”  to “chlorite,”  and
subtract  one more oxygen  atom. The resulting  hypochlorite  ion has one
104 MHR-= Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
oxygen  atom. Adding  “per” to “chlorate,”  means  that you should  add an
oxygen  to the chlorate  ion. The perchlorate  ion has four oxygen  atoms.
The base “ate” ions do not always  have three oxygen  atoms like
chlorate  does. Consider  the polyatomic  ions that contain  sulfur and
oxygen.  In this case, the base ion, sulfate,  SO.?", contains  four oxygen
atoms. The sulfite ion, SO3?, therefore  contains  three oxygen  atoms.
The hyposulfite  ion, SO,”", contains  two oxygen  atoms. Once you know
the meanings  of the prefixes  and suffixes,  you need only memorize  the
formulas  of the “ate” ions. You can work out the formulas  for the related
ions using their prefixes  and suffixes.  The meanings  of the prefixes  and
suffixes  are summarized  in Table 3.7. In this table, the “x” stands for the
number  of oxygen  atoms in the “ate” ion.
Table 3.7 Meaning  of prefixes  and suffixes

Naming  Binary  Compounds  That Contain  Two Non-Metals
To indicate  that a binary  compound  is made up of two non-metals,  a
prefix is usually  added  to both non-metals  in the compound.  This prefix
indicates  the number  of atoms of each element  in one molecule  or formu-
la unit of the compound.  For example,  P2O5 is named  diphosphorus  pen-
toxide.  Alternatively,  the Stock System  may be used, and P2,O; can be
named  phosphorus  (V) oxide. AsBr3 is named  phosphorus  tribromide.
The prefix mono-  is often left out when there is only one atom of the first
element  in the name. A list of numerical  prefixes  is found in Table 3.8.

e Ionic compounds  and covalent  compounds  have

Making  Connections
26. Chemists  do not always  agree on names,  not
just for compounds  but even for elements.  As
new elements  are synthesized  in laboratories,
they must be named.  Until 1997, there was a
controversy  over the names of elements  104 to
109 (called  the transfermium  elements).  The
periodic  table at the back of this textbook  gives
the names  that have now been accepted.  Do
some research  to find out what other names
were proposed  for those elements.  Find out
what justification  was given for the alternative
names  and the accepted  names.  Then write an
essay in which  you evaluate  the choice  that
was made. Do you agree or disagree?  Justify
your opinion.

Classifying  Reactions:
Chemicals  in Balance
Prssure a starry night and tired hikers sitting around a campfire.
Everywhere  in this peaceful  setting,  chemical  reactions  are taking  place.
The cellulose  in the firewood  reacts with the oxygen  in the air, producing
carbon  dioxide  and water. The light and heat of the campfire  are evidence
of the chemical  reaction.  If someone  roasts a marshmallow  its sugars react
with oxygen.  The soft, white marshmallow  forms a brown  and brittle
crust. When someone  eats a marshmallow,  the chemicals  in the stomach
react with the sugar molecules  to digest  them. A person  telling  a story
exhales  carbon  dioxide  with every breath.  Carbon  dioxide  is the product
of respiration,  another  chemical  reaction.
In each star in the night sky above,  another  type of reaction  is taking
place. This type of reaction  is called a nuclear  reaction,  because  it
involves  changes  within  the nucleus  of the atom. Nuclear  reactions  are
responsible  for the enormous  amounts  of heat and light generated  by all
the stars, including  our Sun.
Back on Earth, however,  chemical  reactions  are everywhere  in our
daily lives. We rely on chemical  reactions  for everything  from powering  a
car to making  toast. In this chapter,  you will learn how to write balanced
chemical  equations  for these reactions.  You will look for patterns  and
similarities  between  the chemical  equations,  and you will classify  the
reactions  they represent.  As well, you will learn how to balance  and
classify  equations  for nuclear  reactions.
You learned  above that the cellulose  in firewood  can react
with oxygen  to produce  carbon  dioxide  and water. How can
you describe  and classify  a chemical  reaction  that causes  a
piece of firewood  to become  a chunk of charcoal?  What is
happening  as the charcoal  burns away?Chapter  Preview

Caffeine  is an ingredient  in
coffee,  tea, chocolate,  and
cola drinks. Its chemical  name
is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthene.  You
can see how long names like
this would become  unwieldy
in word equations.Chemical  Equations
In Chapter  3, you learned  how and why elements  combine  to form
different  compounds.  In this section,  you will learn how to describe
what happens  when elements  and compounds  interact  with one another
to form new substances.  These interactions  are called chemical  reactions.
A substance  that undergoes  a chemical  reaction  is called  a reactant.  A
substance  that is formed  in a chemical  reaction  is called a product.
For example,  when the glucose  in a marshmallow  reacts with oxygen
in the air to form water and carbon  dioxide,  the glucose  and oxygen  are
the reactants.  The carbon  dioxide  and water are the products.  Chemists
use chemical  equations  to communicate  what is occurring  in a chemical
reaction.  Chemical  equations  come in several  forms. All of these forms
condense  a great deal of chemical  information  into a short statement.
Word Equations
A word equation  identifies  the reactants  and products  of a chemical
reaction  by name. In Chapter  3, you learned  that chlorine  and sodium
combine  to form the ionic compound  sodium  chloride.  This reaction  can
be represented  by the following  word equation:
sodium  + chlorine — sodium  chloride
In this equation,  “+” means “reacts  with” and “—” means “to form.” Try
writing  some word equations  in the following  Practice  Problems.
Practice  Problems

1. Describe  each reaction  using a word equation.  Label the reactant(s)
and product(s).

(c) Calcium  carbonate,  carbon  dioxide,  and water react to form
calcium  hydrogen  carbonate.
(d) Hydrogen  peroxide  reacts to form water and oxygen.
(e) Sulfur  dioxide  and oxygen  react to form sulfur trioxide.
2. Yeast can facilitate  a reaction  in which  the sugar in grapes  reacts to
form ethanol  and carbon  dioxide.  Write a word equation  to describe
this reaction.
S
Word equations  are useful  because  they identify  the products  and
reactants  in a chemical  reaction.  They do not, however,  provide  any
chemical  information  about  the compounds  and elements  themselves.
If you did not know the formula  for sodium  chloride,  for example,  this
equation  would  not help you understand  the reaction  very well. Another
shortcoming  of a word equation  is that the names  for chemicals  are often
very long and cumbersome.  Chemists  have therefore  devised  a more
convenient  way of representing  reactants  and products.
112 MHR-« Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Skeleton  Equations
Using a chemical  formula  instead  of a chemical  name simplifies  a
chemical  equation.  It allows  you to see at a glance what elements  and
compounds  are involved  in the reaction.  A skeleton  equation  lists the
chemical  formula  of each reactant  on the left, separated  by a + sign
if more than one reactant  is involved,  followed  by an arrow >. The
chemical  formula  of each product  is listed on the right, again separated
by a+ sign if more than one product  is produced.  A skeleton  equation
also shows  the state of each reactant  by using the appropriate  subscript,
as shown  in Table 4.1.
The reaction  of sodium  metal with chlorine  gas to form sodium
chloride  can be represented  by the following  skeleton  equation:
Nas) + Clo) > NaCl(s)
A skeleton  equation  is more useful  to a chemist  than a word equation,
because  it shows the formulas  of the compounds  involved.  It also shows
the state of each substance.Try  writing  some skeleton  equations  in the
following  Practice  Problems.

3. Write a skeleton  equation  for each reaction.
(a) Solid zinc reacts with chlorine  gas to form solid zinc chloride.
(b) Solid calcium  and liquid water react to form solid calcium

(c) Solid barium  reacts with solid sulfur  to produce  solid barium  sulfide.
(d) Aqueous  lead(II)  nitrate  and solid magnesium  react to form
aqueous  magnesium  nitrate  and solid lead.
4. In each reaction  below,  a solid reacts with a gas to form  a solid.
Write a skeleton  equation  for each reaction.
(a) carbon  dioxide  + calcium  oxide — calcium  carbonate
(b) aluminum  + oxygen  — aluminum  oxide
(c) magnesium  + oxygen  — magnesium  oxide
Why Skeleton  Equations  Are Incomplete
Although  skeleton  equations  are useful,  they do not fully describe  chemi-
cal reactions.  To understand  why, consider  the skeleton  equation  showing
the formation  of sodium  chloride  (above).  According  to this equation,  one
sodium  atom reacts with one chlorine  molecule  containing  two chlorine
atoms. The product  is one formula  unit of sodium  chloride,  containing
one atom of sodium  and one atom of chlorine.  Where  has the extra
chlorine  atom gone?
The Law of Conservation  of Mass
All atoms must be accounted  for, according  to an important  law. The law
of conservation  of mass states that in any chemical  reaction,  the mass
of the products  is always  equal to the mass of the reactants.  In other
words,  according  to this law, matter  can be neither  created  nor destroyed.
Chemical  reactions  proceed  according  to the law of conservation  of mass,
which  is based on experimental  evidence.

Food Chemist
How do you make  a better  tasting  sports  drink?
How can you make a gravy mix that can be ready

Jan Baptista  van Helmont
(1577-1644)  was a Flemish
physician  who left medical
practice  to devote himself
to the study of chemistry.  He
used the mass balance  in an
important  experiment  that laid
the foundations  for the law
of conservation  of mass.
He showed  that a definite
quantity  of sand could be fused
with excess  alkali to form a
kind of glass. He also showed
that when this product  was
treated  with acid, it regenerat-
ed the original  amount  of sand
(silica).  As well, Van Helmont  is
famous  for demonstrating  the
existence  of gases,  which he
described  as “aerial  fluids.” C +

Food chemists  work in universities,  govern-
ment laboratories,  and major  food companies.  To
become  a food chemist,  most undergraduates
take a food science  degree  with courses  in chem-
istry. It is also possible  to become  a food chemist
with an undergraduate  chemistry  degree  plus
experience  in the food industry.  Students  can
specialize  in food chemistry  at the graduate  level.

Balanced  Chemical  Equations
A balanced  chemical  equation  reflects  the law of conservation  of mass.
This type of equation  shows  that there is the same number  of each kind
of atom on both sides of the equation.  Some skeleton  equations  are, by
coincidence,  already  balanced.  For example,  examine  the reaction  of
carbon  with oxygen  to form carbon  dioxide,  shown  in Figure  4.1. In the
skeleton  equation,  one carbon  atom and two oxygen  atoms are on the left
side of the equation,  and one carbon  atom and two oxygen  atoms are on
the right side of the equation.
O, ——— CO,
GETZ SY This skeleton  equation  is already  balanced.
Most skeleton  equations,  however,  are not balanced,  such as the one
showing  the formation  of sodium  chloride.  Examine  Figure  4.2 to see
why. There is one sodium  atom on each side of the equation,  but there
are two chlorine  atoms on the left side and only one chlorine  atom on
the right side.
To begin to balance  an equation,  you can add numbers  in front of the
appropriate  formulas.  The numbers  that are placed  in front of chemical
formulas  are called coefficients.  They represent  how many of each atom,
molecule,  or formula  unit take part in each reaction.  For example,  if you
add a coefficient  of 2 to NaCl in the equation  in Figure  4.2, you indicate
that two formula  units of NaCl are produced  in the reaction.  Is the equa-
tion balanced  now? As you can see by examining  Figure 4.3, it is not. The
chlorine  atoms are balanced,  but now there is one sodium  atom on the
left side of the equation  and two sodium  atoms on the right side.

Steps for Balancing  Chemical  Equations
More complex  chemical  equations  than the ones you have already  tried
can be balanced  by using a combination  of inspection  and trial and error.
Here, however,  are some steps to follow.
Step1 Write out the skeleton  equation.  Ensure  that you have copied
all the chemical  formulas  correctly.
Step2 Begin by balancing  the atoms that occur in the largest  number
on either side of the equation.  Leave hydrogen,  oxygen,  and
other elements  until later.
Step3 Balance  any polyatomic  ions, such as sulfate,  SO,7-, that occur
on both sides of the chemical  equation  as an ion unit. That is,
do not split a sulfate  ion into 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygen
atoms. Balance  this ion as one unit.
Step 4 Next, balance  any hydrogen  or oxygen  atoms that occur in a
combined  and uncombined  state. For example,  combined
oxygen  might  be in the form of CO,2, while uncombined
oxygen  occurs  as Oz.
Step5 Finally,  balance  any other element  that occurs  in its
uncombined  state: for example,  Na or Cl).
Step6 Check  your answer.  Count  the number  of each type of atom on
each side of the equation.  Make sure that the coefficients  used
are whole  numbers  in their lowest  terms.
Examine  the following  Sample  Problem  to see how these steps work.

potassium  nitrate  and solid copper(II)  hydroxide.
Balance  the equation.

What Is Required?
The atoms of each element  on the left side of the equation  should
equal the atoms of each element  on the right side of the equation.
Plan Your Strategy
Balance  the polyatomic  ions first (NO3",  then OH). Check  to see
whether  the equation  is balanced.  If not, balance  the potassium
and copper  ions. Check  your equation  again.
Act on Your Strategy
There are two NO; ions on the left, so put a 2 in front of KNO3.
Cu(NOs)o(aq)  + KOH (ag) > Cu(OH)2(s)  + 2KNO3  (aq)
To balance  the two OH ions on the right, put a 2 in front of the KOH.
Cu(NO3)o(aq)  + 2KOH (aq) > Cu(OH)a(s)  + 2KNO3(aq)
Check  to see that the copper  and potassium  ions are balanced.  They
are, so the equation  above is balanced.

of chemical  reactions.

Synthesis  and
Decomposition  Reactions
How are different  kinds of compounds  formed?  In section  4.1, you
learned  that they are formed  by chemical  reactions  that you can describe
using balanced  chemical  equations.  Just as there are different  types of
compounds,  there are different  types of chemical  reactions.  In this
section,  you will learn about five major classifications  for chemical
reactions.  You will use your understanding  of chemical  formulas  and
chemical  equations  to predict  products  for each class of reaction.
Why Classify?
People  use classifications  all the time. For example,  many types of wild
mushrooms  are edible,  but many others are poisonous—even  deadly!  How
can you tell which  is which?  Poisonous  and deadly  mushrooms  have
characteristics  that distinguish  them from edible ones, such as odour,
colour,  habitat,  and shape of roots. It is not always  easy to distinguish
one type of mushroom  from another;  the only visible  difference  may be
the colour  of the mushroom’s  spores.  Therefore,  you should  never try to
eat any wild mushrooms  without  an expert’s  advice.
Examine  Figure 4.5. Which  mushroom  looks more appetizing  to you?
An expert  will always  be able to distinguish  an edible mushroom  from a
poisonous  mushroom  based on the characteristics  that have been used to
classify  each type. By classifying,  they can predict  the effects of eating any
wild mushroom.

The iron in this car
undergoes  a synthesis  reaction
with the oxygen in the air. Iron(III)
oxide, also known as rust, is
formed.In the same way, you can recognize  similarities  between  chemical
reactions  and the types of reactants  that tend to undergo  different  types
of reactions.  With this knowledge,  you can predict  what will happen
when one, two, or more substances  react. In this section,  you will often
see chemical  reactions  without  the subscripts  showing  the states of matter.
They are omitted  deliberately  because,  in most cases, you are not yet in a
position  to predict  the states of the products.
Synthesis  Reactions
In a synthesis  reaction,  two or more elements  or compounds  combine  to
form a new substance.  Synthesis  reactions  are also known  as combination
or formation  reactions.  A general  equation  for a synthesis  reaction  is
A+BoC
In a simple  synthesis  reaction,  one element  reacts with one or more other
elements  to form a compound.  Two, three, four, or more elements  may
react to form a single product,  although  synthesis  reactions  involving  four
or more reactants  are extremely  rare. Why do you think this is so? When
two elements  react together,  the reaction  is almost  always  a synthesis
reaction  because  the product  is almost  always  a single compound.  There
are several  types of synthesis  reactions.  Recognizing  the patterns  of the
various  types of reactions  will help you to predict  whether  substances
will take part in a synthesis  reaction.
When a metal or a non-metal  element  reacts with oxygen,  the product
is an oxide. Figure 4.6 shows a familiar  example,  in which  iron reacts
with oxygen  according  to the following  equation:
3Fe(s) + O2() > Fe204(s)
Two other examples  of this type of reaction  are:
2Ha@) + Org) = 2H20{¢g)
2Mgis) + Ox) > 2Mg0 os)
A second  type of synthesis  reaction  involves  the reaction  of a metal and
a non-metal  to form a binary compound.  One example  is the reaction  of
potassium  with chlorine.
2Kis) + Cla) > 2KC|is)
120 MHR- Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
Synthesis  Reactions  Involving  Compounds
In the previous  two types of synthesis  reactions,  two elements  reacted  to
form one product.  There are many synthesis  reactions  in which  one or
more compounds  are the reactants.  For the purpose  of this course,  howev-
er, we will deal only with the two specific  types of synthesis  reactions
involving  compounds  that you should  recognize:  oxides  and water.
When a non-metallic  oxide reacts with water, the product  is an
acid. You will learn more about acids and the rules for naming  them in
Chapter  10. The acids that form when non-metallic  oxides  and water react
are composed  of hydrogen  cations  and polyatomic  anions  containing
oxygen  and a non-metal.  For example,  one contributor  to acid rain is
hydrogen  sulfate (sulfuric  acid), HzSO,,  which  forms when sulfur  trioxide
reacts with water. The sulfur  trioxide  comes from sources  such as
industrial  plants that emit the gas as a byproduct  of burning  fossil fuels,
as shown  in Figure 4.7.
SO3() + H20 ce) > H2SOQataq)
Sulfur  trioxide,  emitted  by this factory,  reacts  with the water in the air.
Sulfuric  acid is formed in a synthesis  reaction.
Conversely,  when a metallic  oxide reacts with water, the product  is a
metal hydroxide.  Metal hydroxides  belong  to a group of compounds  called
bases. You will learn more about bases in Chapter  10. For example,  when
calcium  oxide reacts with water, it forms calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH)2.
Calcium  oxide is also called lime. It can be added  to lakes to counteract
the effects of acid precipitation.
CaQ,) + H2,0e) > Ca(OH)  (aq)
Sometimes  it is difficult  to predict  the product  of a synthesis  reaction.
The only way to really know the product  of a reaction  is to carry out the
reaction  and then isolate  and identify  the product.  For example,  carbon
can react with oxygen  to form either carbon  monoxide  or carbon  dioxide.
Therefore,  if all you know is that your reactants  are carbon  and oxygen,
you cannot  predict  with certainty  which  compound  will form. You can
only give options.
Cs) + Org) > COz(g)
2C(g) + O2(g) > 2COw)
You would  need to analyze  the products  of the reaction  by experiment  to
determine  which  compound  was formed.HIStoryas LINK
Today we have sophisticated
lab equipment  to help us ana-
lyze the products  of reactions.
In the past, when such equip-
ment was not available,
chemists  sometimes  jeopard-
ized their safety and health to
determine  the products  of the
reactions  they studied.  Sir
Humphry  Davy (1778-1829),
a contributor  to many areas
of chemistry,  thought  nothing
of inhaling  the gaseous  prod-
ucts of the chemical  reactions
that he carried out. He tried
to breathe  pure CQ», then
known as fixed air. He nearly
suffocated  himself  by breath-
ing hydrogen.  In 1800, Davy
inhaled  dinitrogen  monoxide,
N,0, otherwise  known as
nitrous  oxide, and discovered
its anaesthetic  properties.
What is nitrous oxide used
for today?

Decomposition  Reactions
In a decomposition  reaction,  a compound  breaks down into elements  or
other compounds.  Therefore,  a decomposition  reaction  is the opposite  of
a synthesis  reaction.  A general  formula  for a decomposition  reaction  is:
C+ A+B
The substances  that are produced  in a decomposition  reaction  can be
elements  or compounds.  In the simplest  type of decomposition  reaction,
a compound  breaks  down into its component  elements.  One example  is
the decomposition  of water into hydrogen  and oxygen.  This reaction
occurs  when electricity  is passed  through  water. Figure  4.8 shows an
apparatus  set up for the decomposition  of water.
2H,0 > 2H, +O,
More complex  decomposition  reactions  occur when compounds  break

Combustion  Reactions
Combustion  reactions  form an important  class of chemical  reactions.
The combustion  of fuel—wood,  fossil fuel, peat, or dung—has,
throughout  history,  heated  and lit our homes  and cooked  our food.
The energy  produced  by combustion  reactions  moves our airplanes,
trains, trucks,  and cars.
A complete  combustion  reaction  is the reaction  of a compound  or
element  with O, to form the most common  oxides of the elements  that
make up the compound.  For example,  a carbon-containing  compound
undergoes  combustion  to form carbon  dioxide,  CO2. A sulfur-contain-
ing compound  reacts with oxygen  to form sulfur dioxide,  SO2.
Combustion  reactions  are usually  accompanied  by the production
of light and heat. In the case of carbon-containing  compounds,
complete  combustion  results  in the formation  of, among  other things,
carbon  dioxide.  For example,  methane,  CH,, the primary  constituent
of natural  gas, undergoes  complete  combustion  to form carbon  dioxide,
(the most common  oxide of carbon),  as well as water. This combustion
reaction  is represented  by the following  equation:
CHavg) + 202(¢) > COx,(g) + 2H20¢g)
The combustion  of methane,  shown  in Figure  4.10, leads to the formation
of carbon  dioxide  and water.
The complete  combustion  of any compound  that contains  carbon,
hydrogen,  and oxygen  (such as ethanol,  C,H;0H)  produces  carbon
dioxide  and water.At high temperatures,
ammonium  nitrate explodes,
decomposing  into dinitrogen
monoxide  and water.

124Compounds  that contain  elements  other than carbon  also undergo
complete  combustion  to form stable oxides.  For instance,  sulfur-contain-
ing compounds  undergo  combustion  to form sulfur dioxide,  SOz, a
precursor  to acid rain. Complete  combustion  reactions  are often also
synthesis  reactions.  Metals,  such as magnesium,  undergo  combustion
to form their most stable oxide, as shown  in Figure 4.11.

CO, and water. Carbon  monoxide  is a deadly  gas. You should  always  make

In section  4.3, you will learn about two more types of reactions.  You will
learn how performing  these reactions  can help you make inferences  about
the properties  of the elements  and compounds  involved.
Single Displacement  Reactions
In a single displacement  reaction,  one element  in a compound  is
displaced  (or replaced)  by another  element.  Two general  reactions
represent  two different  types of single displacement  reactions.  One type
involves  a metal replacing  a metal cation  in a compound,  as follows:
A+BC  — AC+B
For example,  Zn.) + Fe(NO3)a(ag)  > Zn(NOs)a(aq)  + Fea(s)
The second  type of single displacement  reaction  involves  a non-metal
(usually  a halogen)  replacing  an anion in a compound,  as follows:
DE+F  > DF+E
For example,  Cli) + CaBro(ag)  > CaClo(aq)  + Brace)
Single  Displacement  Reactions  and the Metal Activity  Series
Most single displacement  reactions  involve  one metal displacing  another
metal from a compound.  In the following  equation,  magnesium  metal
replaces  the zinc in ZnCl.,  thereby  liberating  zinc as the free metal.

The following  three reactions  illustrate  the various  types of single
displacement  reactions  involving  metals:
1. Cus) + 2ZAgNOs(aq)  > Cu(NOs)a(aq)  + 2AQ{s)
In this reaction,  one metal replaces  another  metal  in an ionic
compound.  That is, copper  replaces  silver in AgNO3.  Because  of
the +2 charge on the copper  ion, it requires  two nitrate  ions to
balance  its charge.
2. Mgjs) + 2HCl(aq)  > MgClo(aq)  + Hog)
In this reaction,  magnesium  metal replaces  hydrogen  from
hydrochloric  acid, HCl(aq).  Since hydrogen  is diatomic,  it is “liberated”
in the form of H». This reaction  is similar  to reaction  1 if
e you treat hydrochloric  acid as an ionic compound  (which  it techni-
cally is not), and if
e you treat hydrogen  as a metal (also, technically,  not the case).
3. 2Na(s) + 2H20 Vv) > 2NaOH aq) + Hav)
Sodium  metal displaces  hydrogen  from water in this reaction.  Again,
since hydrogen  is diatomic,  it is produced  as Hz. As above,  you can
understand  this reaction  better if
e you treat hydrogen  as a metal, and if
e you treat water as an ionic compound,  H*(OH).

Through  experimentation,  chemists  have ranked  the relative  reactivity  of
the metals,  including  hydrogen  (in acids and in water),  in an activity  series.
The reactive  metals,  such as potassium,  are at the top of the activity  series.
The unreactive  metals,  such as gold, are at the bottom.  In Investigation  4-A,

Handle  the hydrochloric  acid solution  with care.
It is corrosive.  Wipe up any spills with copious
amounts  of water, and inform  your teacher.
Procedure
1. Place your well plate(s)  on a white sheet of
paper. Label them according  to the matrix  on
the previous  page.
2. Place a rice-grain-sized  piece of each metal in
the appropriate  well. Record  the appearance
of each metal.
3. Put enough  drops of the appropriate  solution
to completely  cover the piece of metal.
4. Record  any changes  in appearance  due to a
chemical  reaction.  In reactions  of metal with
acid, look carefully  for the formation  of bub-
bles. If you are unsure  about any observation,
repeat  the experiment  in a small test tube.
This will allow you to better observe  the
reaction.
5. If you believe  that a reaction  has occurred,
write “r” on the matrix.  If you believe
that no reaction  has occurred,  write “nr” on
the matrix.

pour anything  down the drain.

of steel?
6. How do you think an activity  series for metal
would  help you predict  whether  or not a

7. You have learned  that an alloy is a homoge-
neous mixture  (solution)  of two or more
metals.  Steel consists  of mostly  iron.
(a) Which  type of steel appeared  to be the most
reactive?  Which  type was the least reactive?
Did you notice any differences?
(b) What other components  make up steel,
galvanized  steel, and stainless  steel?
Application
8. For what applications  are the various  types of
steel used? Why would  you not use iron for
these applications?
A single displacement  reaction
always  favours  the production
of the less reactive  metal. In
other words,  the “free” metal
that is formed  from the com-
pound must always  be less
reactive  than the metal that
displaced  it. For example,
2AGNO3\aq)  ate Cus) =
Cu(NO3)a(aq)  ar 2AQ{(s)
Silver metal is more stable
than copper  metal. In other
words,  silver is below copper
{in the activity  series.PROBLEM  TIP
=
Most metals  that we use
in everyday  life are actually
alloys. An alloy is a solid
solution  of one metal (or non-
metal) in another  metal. For
example,  steel is an alloy of
iron. Steel has many uses, from
construction  to the automobile
industry.  If the iron were not
alloyed  with other elements,
it would not have the physical
and chemical  properties
required,  such as hardness
and corrosion  resistance.The Metal Activity  Series
As you can see in Table 4.2, the more reactive  metals  are at the top of the
activity  series. The less reactive  metals  are at the bottom.  A reactive  metal
will displace  or replace  any metal  in a compound  that is below  it in the
activity  series. Metals  from lithium  to sodium  will displace  hydrogen  as a
gas from water. Metals  from magnesium  to lead will displace  hydrogen  as
a gas only from acids. Copper,  mercury,  silver, and gold will not displace
hydrogen  from acids.

reaction  of a metal and a metal-containing  compound.  For example,
consider  the following  incomplete  equation.

When a few drops
of silver nitrate,  AgNOs,  are
added to a sample  of salt water,
NaCl(aq), a white precipitate  of
silver chloride,  AgCl, is formed.Double  Displacement  Reactions
A double  displacement  reaction  involves  the exchange  of cations  between
two ionic compounds,  usually  in aqueous  (water)  solution.  A double
displacement  reaction  is also known  as a double  replacement  reaction.
A general  equation  for a double  displacement  reaction  is:
AB+CD > CB+AD
In this equation,  A and C are cations  and B and D are anions.
Consider  the following  situation.  You have two unlabelled  beakers.
One contains  distilled  water, and the other contains  salt water. The two
samples  look virtually  identical.  How can you quickly  determine  which
is the salt water without  tasting  them? (You should  never taste anything
in a chemistry  laboratory.)
A common  test for the presence  of chloride  ions in water is the
addition  of a few drops of silver nitrate  solution.  The formation  of a
white solid indicates  the presence  of chloride  ions, as you can see in
Figure  4.14.
A double  displacement  reaction  has occurred.  That is, the cations
in the reactants  have essentially  changed  places.  This switch  is
modelled  in Figure 4.15.
(oN
NaCliaq)  + AgNOs3(aq)  > AgClis)  + NaNO s(aq)
GPFTEEZ  SEF Sodium  chloride  and silver nitrate form ions in solution.  When silver ions
and chloride  ions come into contact,  they form  a solid.
Since silver chloride  is virtually  insoluble  in water, it forms a solid
compound,  or precipitate.
Double  displacement  reactions  tend to occur in aqueous  solution.  Not
all ionic compounds,  however,  will react with one another  in this way.
You can tell that a double  displacement  reaction  has taken place in the
following  cases:
e a solid (precipitate)  forms
¢ a gas is produced
¢ some double  displacement  reactions  also form a molecular  compound,
such as water. It is hard to tell when water is formed,  because  often the
reaction  takes place in water.
Double  Displacement  Reactions  that Form a Precipitate
A precipitate  is a solid that separates  from a solution  as the result of a
chemical  reaction.  You will learn more about precipitates  in Chapter  9.
Many  double  displacement  reactions  involve  the formation  of a precipitate.
Examine  the double  displacement  reaction  that occurs  when aqueous
solutions  of barium  chloride  and potassium  sulfate  are mixed.  A white
precipitate  is immediately  formed.  The equation  for the reaction  is
BaCly(aq)  + K2SOa(aq)  — BaSOais)  + 2KCl(aq)
132 MHR « Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
You should  think about two questions  when analyzing  a double
displacement  reaction.
1. How do we determine  the products?
2. Which  of the products—if  any—will  precipitate  out of solution?
Barium  chloride  solution  contains  Ba?* ions and Cl ions. Potassium
sulfate solution  contains  K* and SO,” ions. When they are mixed,  the
Ba** ions come in contact  with SO,?" ions. Because  barium  sulfate  is
insoluble,  the product  comes out of solution  as a solid. The K* ions and
CI ions also come into contact  with each other, but potassium  chloride  is
soluble,  so these ions stay in solution.
How do you know that the precipitate  is BaSO, and not KCl? More
generally,  how can you predict  whether  a precipitate  will be formed  in a
double  displacement  reaction?  In this chapter,  you will be given informa-
tion on solubility  as you need it. You will learn more about how to
predict  whether  a compound  is soluble  or not in Chapter  9. Barium
sulfate,  BaSO, is not soluble  in water, while potassium  chloride,  KCl,
is. Therefore,  a reaction  will take place and barium  sulfate  will be the
precipitate.
In summary,  to determine  the products  and their physical  states in a
double  displacement  reaction,  you must first “deconstruct”  the reactants.
Then switch  the cations,  and “reconstruct”  the products  using proper
chemical  formulas.  You should  then balance  the chemical  equation.  You
will be given information  to determine  which  of the products,  if any, will
form a precipitate.  Finally,  you can write the physical  state—(s)  or (aq)—
of each product  and balance  the equation.
Given the following  reactants,  how would  you predict  the products
of the reaction  and their state? Note that many hydroxide  compounds,
including  magnesium  hydroxide,  are insoluble.  Potassium  cations  form
soluble  substances  with all anions.
MgClo(aq)  + KOH aq) —>
Examine  figure 4.16 to see how to separate  the compounds  into ions, Mg?*
and Cl; K* and OH-. Then switch  the anions  and write chemical  formu-

writing  the products  of double  displacement  reactions  and predicting
their states.

Double  Displacement  Reactions  That Produce  a Gas
In certain  cases, you know that a double  displacement  reaction  has
occurred  because  a gas is produced.  The gas is formed  when one of the
products  of the double  displacement  reaction  decomposes  to give water
and a gas.
Consider  the reaction  of aqueous  sodium  carbonate  (washing  soda)
and hydrochloric  acid, shown  in Figure 4.17. Hydrochloric  acid is sold at
the hardware  store under  the common  name “muriatic  acid.” If you carry
out this reaction,  you immediately  see the formation  of carbon  dioxide
gas. The first reaction  that takes place is a double  displacement  reaction.
Determine  the products  in the following  way. Separate  the reactions  into
ions, and switch  the anions.  Write chemical  formulas  for the products
and balance  the equation.
NazCOaiaq)  + 2HCl(aq)  > 2NaCl(aq)  + H2CO3  (aq)
But this isn’t all that is happening!  The carbonic  acid, H,COs,  is unstable
and subsequently  decomposes  to carbon  dioxide  and water.
H2COs(aq) > H20(e + CO2¢)
Overall,  we can write this two-step  reaction  as follows:
NazCOa(aq)  + 2HCl(aq)  > 2NaCliaq)  + H20e) + COr(g)
Another  double  displacement  reaction  results  in the formation  of
gaseous  ammonia,  NH;. Ammonia,  a pungent-smelling  gas, is an impor-
tant industrial  chemical.  It is used as a fertilizer  and, when dissolved  in
water, as a household  cleaner.  Ammonium  hydroxide  is formed  in the
reaction  below
NH4Cl(ag)  + NaOFaq)  > NH4OH  aq) + NaClag)
The ammonium  hydroxide,  NH,OH,  immediately  decomposes  to give
ammonia  and water, according  to the equation
NH,0H aq) > NH3@g) + H20¢e)
Combining  these equations  gives
NH4Claq)  + NaOH aq) > NaClaq)  + NH3¢) + H20(e)

Displacement  Reactions
A double  displacement  reaction  involves
the exchange  of cations  between  two ionic
compounds,  usually  in aqueous  solution.  It can
be represented  with the general  equation
AB+CD —- AD+CB
Most often, double  displacement  reactions  result
in the formation  of a precipitate.  However,  some
double  displacement  reactions  result in the
formation  of an unstable  compound  which
then decomposes  to water and  a gas.
The reaction  of an acid and a base—a
neutralization  reaction—is  also a type of double
displacement  reaction.  It results  in the formation
of a salt and water.
Question
How can you tell if a double  displacement
reaction  has occurred?  How can you predict  the
products  of a double  displacement  reaction?
Prediction
For each reaction  in Tables  A and B, write a
balanced  chemical  equation.  Use the following

of Copper(Il)  Hydroxide
6. At room temperature,  while stirring  with a
glass rod, add 6 mol/L NaOH, drop by drop,
until the solution  is basic to red litmus
paper. (Red litmus  paper turns blue in basic
solution.)  Do not put the red litmus  paper
in the solution.  Dip the glass rod into the
solution  and touch it to the red litmus paper.
Record  your observations.
Reaction  C: Preparation  of Copper‘(ll)  Oxide
7. While constantly  stirring  the solution  with a
glass rod, heat the mixture  from step 6 on a
hot plate until a black precipitate  is formed.
If necessary,  use the wash bottle to wash loose
any unreacted  light blue precipitate  that is
adhering  to the side of the flask.
8. When all of the light blue precipitate  has
reacted  to form the black precipitate,  cool the
flask in an ice bath or a cool water bath for
several  minutes.
Reaction  D: Preparation
of Copperi(il)  Sulfate  Solution
9. Carefully  add about 6 mL of 3 mol/L sulfuric
acid to the flask. Stir it until all the black
precipitate  has dissolved.  Record  your
observations. The sulfuric  acid is
highly  corrosive.  If any comes in contact
with your skin, rinse the area thoroughly
and immediately  with water.
Reaction  E: Regeneration  of Copper  Metal
10. In the fumehood  or in a well ventilated  area,
carefully  add about 0.8 g of powdered  zinc to
the solution  of copper(II)  sulfate.  Stir or swirl
the solution  until the blue colour  disappears.
Record  your observations. You
should  wear a mask for this step to avoid
breathing  in the powdered  zinc.11.When the reaction  is complete,  add 5 mL of
3 mol/L sulfuric  acid while stirring  or swirling
the solution.  This removes  any unreacted  zinc
but does not affect the copper  metal. Carefully
decant  the liquid into a clean waste container.
Wash the copper  metal carefully  several  times
with water. Return  the copper  metal to your
teacher.  Wash your hands. This
sulfuric  acid is highly  corrosive.  If any comes
in contact  with your skin, rinse the area
thoroughly  and immediately  with water.

You have seen some chemical  reactions  that involve  the formation  and
decomposition  of different  compounds.  These reactions  involve  the
rearrangement  of atoms due to the breaking  and formation  of chemical
bonds.  Chemical  bonds involve  the interactions  between  the electrons  of
various  atoms. There is another  class of reactions,  however,  that are not
chemical.  These reactions  involve  changes  that occur within  the nucleus
of atoms. These reactions  are called nuclear  reactions.
We know that nuclear  weapons  are capable  of mass destruction,  yet
radiation  therapy,  shown  in Figure 4.18, is a proven  cancer  fighter.  Smoke
detectors,  required  by law in all homes,  rely on the radioactive  decay of
americium-241.  The human  body itself is radioactive,  due to the presence
of radioactive  isotopes  including  carbon-14,  phosphorus-32,  and potassi-
um-40.  Most people  view radioactivity  and nuclear  reactions  with a
mixture  of fascination,  awe, and fear. Since radioactivity  is all around  us,
it is important  to understand  what it is, how it arises, and how we can
deal with it safely.
Types of Radioactive  Decay  and Balancing  Nuclear  Equations
There are three main types of radioactive  decay: alpha particle  emission,
beta particle  emission,  and the emission  of gamma  radiation.  When an
unstable  isotope  undergoes  radioactive  decay, it produces  one or more dif-
ferent isotopes.  We represent  radioactive  decay using a nuclear  equation.
Two rules for balancing  nuclear  equations  are given below.
Rules for Balancing  Nuclear  Equations
1. The sum of the mass numbers  (written  as superscripts)  on each
side of the equation  must balance.
2. The sum of the atomic  numbers  (written  as subscripts)  on each
side of the equation  must balance.
Alpha Decay
Alpha  (a) particle  emission,  or alpha decay, involves  the loss of one alpha
particle.  An o particle  is a helium  nucleus,  $He, composed  of two protons
and two neutrons.  Since it has no electrons,  an alpha particle  carries  a
charge of +2.
One example  of alpha particle  emission  is the decay of radium.  This
decay is shown  in the following  equation:
27eRa > 722Rn + SHe
Notice  that the sum of the mass numbers  on the right (222 + 4) equals
the mass on the left (226). As well, the atomic  numbers  balance
(88 = 86 + 2). Thus, this nuclear  equation  is balanced.
142 MHR-« Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  Bonding
In another  example  of alpha particle  emission,  Berkelium-248  is
formed  by the decay of a certain  radioisotope  according  to the balanced
nuclear  equation:
“ox + 248Bk + 4He
Given this information,  what is }X? You can use your knowledge  of how
to balance  a nuclear  equation  to determine  the identity  of a radioisotope
undergoing  alpha particle  decay.
The total of the atomic  masses  on the right side is (248 + 4) = 252.
The total of the atomic  numbers  on the right is (97 + 2) = 99. Therefore,
a = 252 and b = 99. From the periodic  table, you see that element  number
99 is Es, einsteinium.  The missing  atom is 73¢Es, so the balanced  nuclear
equation  is:
202Es > 768Bk + 3He
Try the following  problems  to practise  balancing  alpha emission
nuclear  reactions.

balanced  nuclear  equation  for this reaction.
32. Neodymium-144,  ‘s,Nd, decays  by alpha particle  emission.  Write
the balanced  nuclear  equation  for this nuclear  decay.
Beta Decay
Beta (8) decay occurs  when an isotope  emits an electron,  called a beta
particle.  Because  of its tiny mass and —1 charge,  a beta particle,  is repre-
sented as %e. For example,  hydrogen-3,  or tritium,  emits a beta particle  to
form helium-3  as illustrated  by the equation:
3H > 3He+_°e
Notice  that the total of the atomic  masses  and the total of the atomic
numbers  on each side of the nuclear  equation  balance.  What is happen-
ing, however  to the hydrogen-3  nucleus  as this change  occurs?  In effect,
the emission  of a beta particle  is accompanied  by the conversion,  inside
the nucleus,  of a neutron  into a proton:

Carbon-14  decays  by emitting  a beta particle  and converting  to

Radioactive  waste from certain  nuclear  power  plants and from
weapons  testing  can lead to health  problems.  For example,  ions of the
radioactive  isotope  strontium-90,  an alkali metal, exhibit  chemical  behav-
iour similar  to calcium  ions. This leads to incorporation  of the ions in
bone tissue, sending  ionizing  radiation  into bone marrow,  and possibly
causing  leukemia.  Given the following  equation  for the decay of stron-
tium-90,  how would  you complete  it?
seSr > + %e
Since both atomic  numbers  and mass numbers  must balance,  you can find
the other product.
The mass number  of the unknown  element  is equal to 90 + 0 = 90.
The atomic  number  of the unknown  element  is equal to 38 — (—1) = 39.
From the periodic  table, you can see that element  39 is yttrium,  Y.
The balanced  nuclear  equation  is therefore
sgsr > 38Y + fe
You can check your answer  by ensuring  that the total mass number  and
the total atomic  number  on each side of the equation  are the same.
Mass numbers  balance:  90 = 90 + 0
Atomic  numbers  balance:  38 = 39 + (-1)

. :Canadians  | in Chemistry
Harriet  Brooks
It was the Nobel that just missed  being Canadian.
In 1907, Ernest Rutherford  left Montréal’s  McGill
University  for a position  in England.  The following
year, he received  the Nobel Prize for Chemistry  forHarriet  Brooks  is nearly  forgotten  today,  even
though  she helped  to show that elements  could
be transformed.  For over a century,  chemists  had
rejected  the dream of the ancient  alchemists  who
thought  that they might  turn lead into gold with the
help of the philosopher's  stone. They believed  that
elements  were forever  fixed and unchangeable.
Then Harriet  Brooks  arrived  on the scene.
When she joined Rutherford’s  team, she was
asked to measure  the atomic  mass of the isotopes
that make up the mysterious  vapour  given off by
radium.  She determined  that its atomic  mass was
between  40 and 100, whereas  radium  was known
to have an atomic  mass of over 140. Surely  this
was not just a gaseous  form of radium.  Somehow
radium  was turning  into another  element!
It turned out that Brooks’  result was a mis-
take. Radon—as  the mystery  gas is now known—
has almost  the same atomic  mass as radium.
Brooks’  result was a fruitful mistake,  however.
Her experiment  led to a basic understanding  of
radioactivity  and isotopes.
his investigations  of the chemistry  of radioactive
substances.  Most of the work, however,  had been
done in Montréal.  Moreover,  one young Canadian
woman  had played an important  role in putting  it
on the right track.Why did Rutherford  win a Nobel Prize for
Chemistry?  Both he and Brooks  worked  as
physicists.  By proving  that elements  transformed,
Rutherford,  Brooks,  and their co-workers  revolu-
tionized  traditional  chemistry.
Gamma  Radiation
Gamma  (y) radiation  is high energy  electromagnetic  radiation.  It often
accompanies  either alpha or beta particle  emission.  Since gamma
radiation  has neither  mass nor charge,  it is represented  as @y, or simply  y.
For example,  cesium-137  is a radioactive  isotope  that is found in nuclear
fall-out.  It decays  with the emission  of a beta particle  and gamma
radiation,  according  to the equation
137 137 0 05508 — “g4Ba + je + oY
How is gamma  radiation  produced  in a radioactive  decay?  When a
radioactive  nucleus  emits an alpha or beta particle,  the nucleus  is often
left in an unstable,  high-energy  state. The “relaxation”  of the nucleus  to
a more stable state is accompanied  by the emission  of gamma  radiation.
Nuclear  Fission  and Fusion
All cases of radioactive  decay involve  the atom’s  nucleus.  Since these
processes  do not involve  the atom’s electrons,  they occur regardless  of the
chemical  environment  of the nucleus.  For example,  radioactive  hydrogen-
3, or tritium,  will decay  by B particle  emission  whether  it is contained  in
a water molecule  or hydrogen  gas, or in a complex  protein.

A summary  of alpha decay, beta decay,  and gamma  emission
Many chemical  reactions,  once begun, can be stopped.  For example,
a combustion  reaction,  such as a fire, can be extinguished  before it burns
itself out. Nuclear  decay processes,  on the other hand, cannot  be stopped.
The principles  of balancing  nuclear  equations  apply to all nuclear
reactions.  Nuclear  fission  occurs  when a highly  unstable  isotope  splits
into smaller  particles.  Nuclear  fission  usually  has to be induced  in a
particle  accelerator.  Here, an atom can absorb  a stream  of high-energy
particles  such as neutrons,  gn. This will cause the atom to split into
smaller  fragments.
For example,  when uranium-235  absorbs  a high energy  neutron,  jn, it
breaks  up, or undergoes  fission  as follows:
235U + in > 82Brt + 39n
How would  you identify  the missing  particle?  Notice  that three neutrons,
ou, have a mass number  of 3 and a total atomic  number  of 0. The total
atomic  mass on the left side is (235 + 1) = 236. On the right we have
(87 + 3(1)) = 90, and so (236 — 90) = 146 remains.  The missing  particle
must have a mass number  of 146.
The total atomic  number  on the left is 92. The total atomic  number
on the right, not including  the missing  particle,  is 35. This means  that
(92 — 35) = 57 is the atomic  number  of the missing  particle.  From the
periodic  table, atomic  number  57 corresponds  to La, lanthanum.  The
balanced  nuclear  equation  is
235U + jn > 82Br+ M4SLa + 3in
Check  your answer  by noting  that the total mass number  and the total
atomic  number  are the same on both sides.

Nuclear  fusion  occurs  when a target nucleus  absorbs  an accelerated
particle.  The reaction  that takes place in a hydrogen  bomb is a fusion
reaction,  as are the reactions  that take place within  the Sun, shown  in
Figure  4.21. Fusion  reactions  require  very high temperatures  to proceed
but produce  enormous  amounts  of energy.  The fusion  reaction  that takes
place in a hydrogen  bomb is represented  by the following  equation:

© Nuclear  reactors  have complex  cooling  systems  that absorb the
heat given off by the fission  reaction.  The absorbed  heat is used to
produce  steam to drive a generator,  thus producing  electrical  energy.
Cooling  the steam for re-use requires  a large amount  of cool water,
which  is usually  obtained  from a nearby  river or lake. A large amount
of hot water is then released  into the river or lake. Do you think this is
a form of pollution?  What kinds of problems  might  warm water cause?
0 Alpha or beta particle  emission  from a radioactive  nucleus  is
often, but not always,  accompanied  by gamma  rays. Why does the
presence  of gamma  rays not affect how a nuclear  equation  of this type
is balanced?
5 ] Write a balanced  nuclear  equation  to describe  each of the
following  statements.  Classify  the reactions.
(a) Radon-222  undergoes  alpha decay, forming  polonium-218.
(b) When hydrogen-2  (deuterium)  and hydrogen-3  (tritium)  react, they
form an alpha particle  and a subatomic  particle.
(c) Bismuth-214  undergoes  beta decay, emitting  one electron  and
forming  a different  nucleus.
(d) When a neutron  collides  with uranium-235,  it forms krypton-92  and
one other nucleus.
(e) Polonium-218  decays  to lead-214,  emitting  one other particle.
(f) Strontium-90  emits a subatomic  particle,  forming  yttrium-90.

152. MHR-» Unit 1 Matter  and Chemical  BondingBackground
Many of the chemicals  in your school  laboratory  are
hazardous.  Some are corrosive,  some are flammable,
and some are poisonous.  Many exhibit  these proper-
ties when they are combined.  You can work safely
with these chemicals,  as long as you treat them with
care and respect,  observe  proper  safety precautions,
and follow  the directions  that are given by your
teacher  and this textbook.
Did you know that many of the chemical  products
in your home are hazardous,  too? For example,  com-
mon household  bleach,  when used as directed,  is safe
for disinfecting  and whitening  clothing.  Hazard  labels
on bleaching  products,  however,  warn against  mixing
bleach  with acids, household  ammonia,  or products
that contain  these chemicals.  Bleach,  when combined
with acids, produces  toxic chlorine  gas. The products
of combining  bleach  with ammonia  are explosive.
Most homes  contain  numerous  chemical  products,
ranging  from cleaners  and disinfectants,  to fertilizers
and fuels. All potentially  hazardous  products  have a
warning  on their containers  or on paper inserts  in
their packaging.  Many, but not all, have  a list of the
chemicals  they contain.  Some hazardous  products
advise  users only to keep them away from children
and pets.
How much do you know about the safe use of
chemical  products?  Would  you know what to do if an
accidental  spill occurred?  Would  the members  of your
family,  or people  in your community,  know what to do?
Challenge
Design,  produce,  and distribute  a newsletter  to
inform  your community  about the safe use of common
chemical  products.  Include  the potential  hazards  of
these products  to living things and the environment.
Also include  emergency  procedures  to follow  if an
accident  occurred.
Materials
Select a medium  for your newsletter,  such as a
traditional  paper newsletter  or an electronic  version
for the Internet.  For a traditional  newsletter,  you
will need to decide  on methods  of production  and
distribution.  For an electronic  version,  you will need
to use computer  hardware  and software.

A recipe for chocolate chip muffins tells you exactly what ingredients
you will need. One recipe  might call for flour, butter, eggs, milk, vinegar,
baking  soda, sugar, and chocolate  chips. It also tells you how much of
each ingredient  you will need, using convenient  units of measurement.
Which  of the ingredients  do you measure  by counting?  Which  do you
measure  by volume  or by mass? The recipe does not tell you exactly  how

too long to count individual  chocolate  chips or grains of sugar. Instead,  the

In some ways, chemistry  is similar  to baking.  To carry out a reaction
successfully—in  chemistry  or in baking—you  need to know how much
of each reactant  you will need. When  you bake something  with vinegar
and baking  soda, for example,  the baking  soda reacts with acetic acid in
the vinegar  to produce  carbon  dioxide  gas. The carbon  dioxide  gas helps
the batter rise. The chemical  equation  for this reaction  is

According  to the balanced  equation,  one molecule  of baking  soda
reacts with one molecule  of acetic acid to form a salt, water, and carbon

amount  of baking  soda and vinegar  to use? Their molecules  are much too
small and numerous  to be counted  like eggs.
In this chapter,  you will learn how chemists  count atoms by organiz-

Relating  Atomic  Masses  to Macroscopic  Masses
In Chapter  2, you learned  that the mass of an atom is expressed  in
atomic  mass units. Atomic  mass units are a relative  measure,  defined  by
the mass of carbon-12.  According  to this definition,  one atom of carbon-12
is assigned  a mass of 12 u. Stated another  way, 1 u = > of the mass of
one atom of carbon-12.
The masses  of all other atoms are defined  by their relationship  to
carbon-12.  For example,  oxygen-16  has a mass that is 133% of the mass
of carbon-12.  Hence  the mass of an atom of oxygen-16  is
133Too * 12-000  u = 16.0 u.
162 MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
Usually,  not all the atoms in an element  have the same mass. As you
learned  in Chapter  2, atoms of the same element  that contain  different
numbers  of neutrons  are called isotopes.  Most elements  are made up of
two or more isotopes.  Chemists  need to account  for the presence  of iso-
topes when finding  the relationship  between  the mass of a large number
of atoms and the mass of a single atom. To understand  why this is impor-
tant, consider  the following  analogy.
Imagine  that you have the task of finding  the total mass of 10 000
spoons.  If you know the mass of a dessertspoon,  can you assume  that its
mass represents  the average  mass of all the spoons?  What if the 10 000
spoons  include  soupspoons,  dessertspoons,  and tablespoons?  If you use
the mass of a dessertspoon  to calculate  the total mass of all the spoons,
you may obtain  a reasonable  estimate.  Your answer  will not be accurate,
however,  because  each type of spoon has a different  mass. You cannot
calculate  an accurate  average  mass for all the spoons  based on knowing
the mass of only one type. How can you improve  the accuracy  of your
answer  without  determining  the mass of all the spoons?
7,{|
GRETA]  Think about finding  the average  mass of a group of objects  that have
different  masses.  How is this similar  to finding  the average  mass of an element  that is
composed  of different  isotopes?
Isotopic  Abundance
Chemists  face a situation  similar  to the one described  above. Because  all
the atoms in a given element  do not have the same number  of neutrons,
they do not all have the same mass. For example,  magnesium  has three
naturally  occurring  isotopes.  It is made up of 79% magnesium-24,
10% magnesium-25,  and 11% magnesium-26.  Whether  the magnesium
is found in a supplement  tablet (like the ones on the right) or in seawater
as Mg(OH),,  it is always  made up of these three isotopes  in the same
proportion.  The relative  amount  in which  each isotope  is present  in an
element  is called the isotopic  abundance.  It can be expressed  as a percent
or as a decimal  fraction.  When chemists  consider  the mass of a sample
containing  billions  of atoms, they must take the isotopic  abundance
into account.J
Magnesium  plays  a variety  of
roles in the body. It is involved
in energy  production,  nerve
function,  and muscle relax-
ation, to name just a few.
The magnesium  in these
tablets,  like all naturally
occurring  magnesium,  Is
made up of three isotopes.
Chapter  5 Counting  Atoms and Molecules:  The Mole » MHR_ 163
The only elements  with only
one naturally  occurring
isotope are beryllium,  sodium,
aluminum,  and phosphorus.Average  Atomic  Mass and the Periodic  Table
The average  atomic  mass of an element  is the average  of the masses
of all the element’s  isotopes.  It takes into account  the abundance  of each
isotope  within  the element.  The average  atomic  mass is the mass that is
given for each element  in the periodic  table.
It is important  to interpret  averages  carefully. For example,  in 1996,
the average  size of a Canadian  family  was 3.1. Of course,  no one family
actually  has 3.1 people.  In the same way, while the average  atomic  mass
of carbon  is 12.01 u, no one atom of carbon  has a mass of 12.01 u.
Examine  Figure 5.3. Since the atomic  mass unit is based on carbon-12,
why does the periodic  table show a value of 12.01 u, instead  of exactly
12 u? Carbon  is made up of several  isotopes,  not just carbon-12.  Naturally
occurring  carbon  contains  carbon-12,  carbon-13,  and carbon-14.  If all
these isotopes  were present  in equal amounts,  you could simply  find
the average  of the masses  of the isotopes.  This average  mass would  be
about 13 u, since the masses  of carbon-13  and carbon-14  are about 13 u
and 14 u respectively.
The isotopes,  though,  are not present  in equal amounts.  Carbon-12
comprises  98.9% of all carbon,  while carbon-13  accounts  for 1.1%.
Carbon-14  is present  in a very small amount—about  1 x 1071°%.  It makes
sense that the average  mass of all the isotopes  of carbon  is 12.01 u—very
close to 12—since  carbon-12  is by far the predominant  isotope.
average  atomic  mass (u)
(GETEAEEE]  The atomic mass that is given in the periodic  table represents  the average
mass of all the naturally  occurring  isotopes  of the element.  It takes into account  their
isotopic  abundances.
Thus chemists  need to know an element’s  isotopic  abundance  and the
mass of each isotope  to calculate  the average  atomic  mass. How do
chemists  determine  the isotopic  abundance  associated  with each element?
How do they find the mass of each isotope?  They use a mass
spectrometer,  a powerful  instrument  that generates  a magnetic  field to
obtain  data about the mass and abundance  of atoms and molecules.  You
will learn more about the mass spectrometer  in Tools & Techniques  on
page 166. You can use the data obtained  with a mass spectrometer  to
calculate  the average  atomic  mass given in the periodic  table.
164 MHR- Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
Working  with Weighted  Averages
If you obtain  the isotopic  abundance  of an element  from mass spectrome-
ter data or a table, you can calculate  the average  atomic  mass of the ele-
ment. You do this by calculating  the weighted  average  of each isotope’s
mass. A weighted  average  takes into account  not only the values  associat-
ed with  a set of data, but also the abundance  or importance  of each value.
Normally,  when you calculate  the average  of a set of data, you find the
equally  weighted  average.  You add the given values  and divide  the total
by the number  of values  in the set. Each value in the average  is given
equal weight.  For example,  imagine  that you have three objects:  A, B, and
C. A has a mass of 1.0 kg, B has a mass of 2.0 kg, and C has a mass of 3.0
kg. Their average  mass is
Mass of (A+B+C)  _ 1.0 kg+2.0kg+  3.0 kg
Number  of items 3
= 2.0 kg
What if you have a set containing  two of A, one of B, and three of C?
Their average  mass becomes
2(1.0 kg) + 2.0 kg + 3(3.0 kg)
6= 2.2 kg
This is a weighted  average.
Another  way to calculate  the same weighted  average  is to consider
the relative  abundance  of each object. There are six objects  in total. A is
present  as = (33%) of the total, B is present  as = (17%) of the total, and C
is present  as 3 (50%) of the total. Thus their average  mass can be calculat-
ed in the following  way:
(0.33)(1.0  kg) + (0.17)(2.0  kg) + (0.50)(3.0  kg) = 2.2 kg
Calculating  Average  Atomic  Mass
You can use a similar  method  to calculate  average  atomic  mass. If you
know the atomic  mass of each isotope  that makes  up an element,  as well
as the isotopic  abundance  of each isotope,  you can calculate  the average
atomic  mass of the element.
For example,  lithium  exists as two isotopes:  lithium-7  and lithium-6.
As you can see in Figure 5.4, lithium-7  has a mass of 7.015 u and makes
up 92.58%  of lithium.  Lithium-6  has a mass of 6.015 u and makes  up
the remaining  7.42%.  To calculate  the average  atomic  mass of lithium,
multiply  the mass of each isotope  by its abundance.
(“28  )(7.015 u) + (455 )(6.015 u) = 6.94 u
Looking  at the periodic  table confirms  that the aver-
age atomic  mass of lithium  is 6.94 u. The upcoming
Sample  Problem  gives another
example  of how to calculate  average
atomic  mass.

The Mass Spectrometer
Many chemists  depend  on instruments  known
as mass spectrometers.  Mass spectrometers  can
detect  trace pollutants  in the atmosphere,  provide
information  about the composition  of large mole-
cules, and help to determine  the age of Earth’s
oldest rocks.
As well, mass spectrometers  can find the
relative  abundance  of each isotope  in an element.
In 1912, J.J. Thompson  first detected  neon-20
and neon-22  in a sample  of neon gas by using a
magnetic  field to separate  the isotopes.
Today’s  mass spectrometers  also use a mag-
netic field to separate  the isotopes  of an element.
Since a magnetic  field can only affect the path of
a charged  particle,  the atoms must first be
charged,  or “ionized.”  The magnetic  field then
deflects  ions with the same charge,  but different
masses,  onto separate  paths. Imagine  rolling a
tennis ball at a right angle to the air current  from
a fan. The air current  deflects  the path of the ball.
The same air current  deflects a Ping-PongTM  ball
more than a tennis ball. Similarly,  a magnetic
field deflects  isotopes  of smaller  mass more than
isotopes  of larger mass.In a mass spectrometer,  elements  that are not
gases are vaporized  by heating.  Next, the gas
atoms are ionized.  In electron  impact  ionization,
the gas atoms are bombarded  with a stream of
electrons  from a heated  filament.  These electrons
collide  with the gas atoms,  causing  each atom to
lose an electron  and become  a positive  ion.
The ions are focussed  and accelerated  by elec-
tric fields, toward  a magnetic  field. The magnetic
field deflects  them and forces  them to take a
curved  path. Lighter  ions curve more than heavier
ions. Therefore  ions from different  isotopes  arrive
at different  destinations.  Since ions have a charge,
a detector  can be used to register  the current  at
each destination.  The current  is proportional  to
the number  of ions that arrive at the destination.
An isotope  that has a larger relative  abundance
generates  a larger current.  From the currents  at
the different  destinations,  chemists  can deduce
the proportion  of each isotope  in the element.
Mass spectral  data for neon, below,  show
the relative  abundance  of the isotopes  of neon.
Using mass spectrometers,  chemists  now detect
a signal from neon-21,  in addition  to the signals
from neon-20  and neon-22.

What Is Given?
Atomic  mass of '8B = 10.01 u
Atomic  mass of 3B = 11.01 u
From the periodic  table, the average  atomic  mass of boron
is B= 10.81 u.
Plan Your Strategy
Express  the abundance  of each isotope  as a decimal  rather than a
percent.  The total abundance  of both isotopes  is therefore  1. Let the
abundance  of boron-10  be x. Let the abundance  of boron-11  be 1 — x.
Set up an equation,  and solve for x.
Act on Your Strategy
Average  atomic  mass = x(atomic  mass B-10) + (1 — x)(atomic  mass B-11)
10.81 = x(10.01)  + (1 — x)(11.01)
10.81 = 10.01x  + 11.01 —11.01x
11.01x  — 10.01x  = 11.01 — 10.81
xX = 0.2000
The abundance  of boron-10  is 0.2000.
The abundance  of boron-11  is 1 — x, or 1 — 0.2000 = 0.8000.
The abundance  of ‘8B is therefore  20.00%.  The abundance
of "1B is 80.00%.
Check  Your Solution
The fact that boron-11  comprises  80% of naturally  occurring  boron
makes sense, because  the average  atomic  mass of boron is 10.81 u.
This is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.

Grouping  for Convenience
In a chemistry  lab, as well as in other contexts,  it is important  to be able
to measure  amounts  accurately  and conveniently.  When you purchase
headache  tablets  from a drugstore,  you are confident  that each tablet
contains  the correct  amount  of the active ingredient.  Years of testing  and
development  have determined  the optimum  amount  of the active ingredi-
ent that you should  ingest. If there is too little of the active ingredient,  the
tablet may not be effective.  If there is too much,  the tablet may be harm-
ful. When  the tablets  are manufactured,  the active ingredient  needs to be
weighed  in bulk. When  the tablets  are tested,  however,  to ensure  that they
contain  the right amount  of the active ingredient,  chemists  need to know
how many molecules  of the substance  are present.  How do chemists
group particles  so that they know how many are present  in a given mass
of substance?
On its own, the mass of a chemical  is not very useful  to a chemist.
The chemical  reactions  that take place depend  on the number  of atoms
present,  not on their masses.  Since atoms are far too small and numerous
to count, you need a way to relate the numbers  of atoms to masses  that
can be measured.

GFETISEZS  Certain items,
because  of their size, are often
handled  in bulk. Would you
rather count reams of paper or
individual  sheets?
Language LINK
The term mole is an
abbreviation  of another  word.
What do you think this other
word is? Check  your guess by
consulting  a dictionary.When  many items in a large set need to be counted,  it is often useful
to work with groups  of items rather  than individual  items. When  you hear
the word “dozen,”  you think of the number  12. It does not matter  what
the items are. A dozen  refers to the quantity  12 whether  the items are eggs
or pencils  or baseballs.  Table 5.1 lists some common  quantities  that we
use to deal with everyday  items.
Table 5.1 Some Common  Quantities
Item | Quantity | Amount

soft drinks | six-pack 6
eggs dozen 12
pens gross (12 dozen) 144
paper ream 500
You do not buy eggs one at a time. You purchase  them in units of a dozen.
Similarly,  your school  does not order photocopy  paper  by the sheet. The
paper is purchased  in bundles  of 500 sheets,  called a ream. It would  be
impractical  to sell sheets of paper individually.
The Definition  of the Mole
Convenient,  or easily  measurable,  amounts  of elements  contain  huge num-
bers of atoms. Therefore  chemists  use a quantity  that is much larger than a
dozen or a ream to group atoms and molecules  together.  This quantity  is
the mole (symbol  mol).
e One mole (1 mol) of a substance  contains  6.022 141 99 x 107° particles
of the substance.  This value is called  the Avogadro  constant.  Its symbol
is Na.
e The mole is defined  as the amount  of substance  that contains  as many
elementary  entities  (atoms,  molecules,  or formula  units) as exactly  12 g
of carbon-12.
172 MHR- Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
For example,  one mole of carbon  contains  6.02 x 10*° atoms of C. One
mole of sodium  chloride  contains  6.02 x 107? formula  units of NaCl.
One mole of hydrofluoric  acid contains  6.02 x 107° molecules  of HF.
The Avogadro  constant  is an experimentally  determined  quantity.
Chemists  continually  devise  more accurate  methods  to determine  how
many atoms are in exactly  12 g of carbon-12.  This means  that the accepted
value has changed  slightly  over the years since it was first defined.
The Chemist's  Dozen
The mole is literally  the chemist’s  dozen.  Just as egg farmers  and grocers
use the dozen (a unit of 12) to count eggs, chemists  use the mole (a much
larger number)  to count atoms,  molecules,  or formula  units. When  farmers
think of two dozen eggs, they are also thinking  of 24 eggs.
(2 dezen) x (288° ) = 24 eggs
Chemists  work in a similar  way. As you have learned  above, 1 mol
has 6.02 x 10*° particles.  Thus 2 mol of aluminum  atoms contain
12.0 x 10° atoms of Al.
2 motx (6.02 x 1023 atomsS) = 1,20 x 1024 atoms of Al
How Big Is the Avogadro  Constant?
The Avogadro  constant  is a huge number.  Its magnitude  becomes  easier
to visualize  if you imagine  it in terms of ordinary  items. For example,
suppose  that you created  a stack of 6.02 x 107 loonies,  as in Figure 5.7.
To determine  the height  of the stack, you could determine  the height  of
one loonie and multiply  by 6.02 x 1073. The Avogadro  constant  needs to
be this huge to group single atoms into convenient  amounts.  What does
1 mol of a substance  look like? Figure 5.8 shows some samples  of elements.
Each sample  contains  6.02 x 107% atoms. Notice  that each sample  has a
different  mass. You will learn why in section  5.3. Examine  the following

Converting  Number  of Particles  to Moles
Chemists  very rarely express  the amount  of a substance  in number  of
particles.  As you have seen, there are far too many particles  to work with
conveniently.  For example,  you would never say that you had dissolved
3.21 x 107° molecules  of sodium  chloride  in water. You might say, howev-
er, that you had dissolved  0.533 mol of sodium  chloride  in water. When
chemists  communicate  with each other about amounts  of substances,
they usually  use units of moles (see Figure 5.10). To convert  the number
of particles  in a substance  to the number  of moles, rearrange  the equation
you learned  previously.

GETESERED  The Avogadro5. 3 Molar Mass
In section  5.2, you explored  the relationship  between  the number  of atoms
or particles  and the number  of moles in a sample.  Now you are ready to
relate the number  of moles to the mass, in grams. Then you will be able to
determine  the number  of atoms,  molecules,  or formula  units in a sample
by finding  the mass of the sample.
Mass and the Mole
You would  never express  the mass of a lump of gold, like the one in
Figure 5.11, in atomic  mass units. You would express  its mass in grams.
How does the mole relate the number  of atoms to measurable  quantities
of a substance?  The definition  of the mole pertains  to relative  atomic
mass, as you learned  in section  5.1. One atom of carbon-12  has a mass of
exactly  12 u. Also, by definition,  one mole of carbon-12  atoms (6.02 x 107°
carbon-12  atoms)  has a mass of exactly  12 g.
The Avogadro  constant  is the factor that converts  the relative  mass of
individual  atoms or molecules,  expressed  in atomic  mass units, to mole
quantities,  expressed  in grams.
How can you use this relationship  to relate mass and moles?  The
periodic  table tells us the average  mass of a single atom in atomic  mass
units (u). For example,  zinc has an average  atomic  mass of 65.39 u. One
mole of an element  has a mass expressed  in grams  numerically  equivalent
to the element’s  average  atomic  mass expressed  in atomic  mass units. One
mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g. This relationship  allows
chemists  to use a balance  to count atoms. You can use the periodic  table
to determine  the mass of one mole of an element.
What is Molar Mass?
The mass of one mole of any element,  expressed  in grams, is numerically
equivalent  to the average  atomic  mass of the element,  expressed  in atomic
mass units. The mass of one mole of a substance  is called its molar  mass
(symbol  M). Molar  mass is expressed  in g/mol. For example,  the average
atomic  mass of gold, as given in the periodic  table, is 196.97  u. Thus the
mass of one mole of gold atoms, gold’s molar mass, is 196.97  g. Table 5.2
gives some additional  examples  of molar masses.

Finding  the Molar Mass of Compounds
While you can find the molar  mass of an element  just by looking  at the
periodic  table, you need to do some calculations  to find the molar  mass
of a compound.  For example,  1 mol of beryllium  oxide, BeO, contains
1 mol of beryllium  and 1 mol of oxygen.  To find the molar  mass of BeO,
add the mass of each element  that it contains.
Mseo = 9.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol
= 25.01 g/molThe National  Institute  of
Standards  and Technology
(NIST) and most other stan-
dardization  bodies use M to
represent  molar mass. You
may see other symbols,  such
as mm, used to represent

What is the mass of one mole of calcium  phosphate,  Ca3(PO,)2?
What Is Required?
You need to find the molar  mass of calcium  phosphate.
What Is Given?
You know the formula  of calcium  phosphate.  You also know, from
the periodic  table, the average  atomic  mass of each atom that makes
up calcium  phosphate.
Plan Your Strategy
Find the total mass of each element  to determine  the molar mass
of calcium  phosphate.  Find the mass of 3 mol of calcium,  the mass
of 2 mol of phosphorus,  and the mass of 8 mol of oxygen.  Then add
these masses  together.
Act on Your Strategy
Mca X 3 = (40.08 g/mol)  x 3 = 120.24  g/mol
Mp X 2 = (30.97 g/mol)  x 2 = 61.94 g/molPROBLEM  TIP
Once you are used to
calculating  molar masses,Mo X 8 = (16.00 g/mol)  x 8 = 128.00  g/mol
Mca,(P0,),  = 120.24  g/mol + 61.94 g/mol + 128.00  g/mol
= 310.18  g/mol
Therefore  the molar  mass of calcium  phosphate  is 310.18  g/mol.
Check  Your Solution
Using round  numbers  for a quick check,  you get
(40 x 3) +(30 x 2) + (15 x 8) = 300
This estimate  is close to the answer  of 310.18  g/mol.| line of calculations.you will want to do the four

Converting  from Mass to Moles
In the previous  Sample  Problem,  you saw how to convert  moles to mass.
Often, however,  chemists  know the mass of a substance  but are more
interested  in knowing  the number  of moles. Suppose  that a reaction
produces  223 g of iron and 204 g of aluminum  oxide. The masses  of
the substances  do not tell you very much about the reaction.  You know,
however,  that 223 g of iron is 4 mol of iron. You also know that 204 g of
aluminum  oxide is 2 mol of aluminum  oxide. You may conclude  that
the reaction  produces  twice as many moles of iron as it does moles of
aluminum  oxide. You can perform  the reaction  many times to test your
conclusion.  If your conclusion  is correct,  the mole relationship  between
the products  will hold. To calculate  the number  of moles in a sample,  find
out how many times the molar  mass goes into the mass of the sample.

Vitamins  and minerals  (micronutrients)  help
to regulate  your metabolism.  They are the
building  blocks  of blood and bone, and they
maintain  muscles  and nerves.  In Canada,  a
standard  called Recommended  Nutrient  Intake
(RND outlines  the amounts  of micronutrients
that people  should  ingest each day. Eating a
balanced  diet is the best way to achieve  your
RNI. Sometimes,  however,  you may need to
take multivitamin  supplements  when you are
unable  to attain your RNI through  diet alone.
The label on a bottle of supplements  lists
all the vitamins  and minerals  the supplements
contain.  It also lists the form and source of
each vitamin  and mineral,  and the amount
of each. The form of a mineral  is especially
important  to know because  it affects  the
quantity  your body can use. For example,  a
supplement  may claim to contain  650 mg of
calcium  carbonate,  CaCOs,  per tablet. This
does not mean that there is 650 mg of calcium.
The amount  of actual calcium,  or elemental
calcium,  in calcium  carbonate  is only 260 mg.
Calcium  carbonate  has more elemental  calcium
than the same amount  of calcium  gluconate,
which  only has 58 mg for every 650 mg of the
compound.  Calcium  gluconate  may be easier
for your body to absorb,  however.
Quality  Control
Multivitamin  manufacturers  employ  chemists,
or analysts,  to ensure  that the products  they
make have the right balance  of micronutrients.
Manufacturers  have departments  devoted
to quality  control  (QC). QC chemists  analyze
all the raw materials  in the supplements,  using
standardized  tests. Most manufacturers  use
tests approved  by a “standardization  body,”
such as the US Pharmacopoeia.  Such standard-
ization  bodies  have developed  testing  guide-
lines to help manufacturers  ensure  that their
products  contain  what the labels claim, within
strict limits.
To test for quality,  QC chemists  prepare
samples  of the raw materials  from which  they
188 MHR- Unit 2 Chemical  Quantitieswill make the supplements.  They label the
samples  according  to the “lot” of materials
from which  the samples  were taken. They pow-
der and weigh  the samples.  Then they extract
the vitamins.  At the same time, they prepare
standard  solutions  containing  a known  amount
of each vitamin.
Next the chemists  compare  the samples  to
the standards  by subjecting  both to the same
tests. One test that is used is high-performance
liquid chromatography  (HPLC).  HPLC produces
a spectrum,  or “fingerprint,”  that identifies
each compound.  Analysts  compare  the
spectrum  that is produced  by the samples  to
the spectrum  that is produced  by the standard.
Analysts  test tablets  and capsules  for
dissolution  and disintegration  properties.  The
analyst  may use solutions  that simulate  the
contents  of the human  stomach  or intestines
for these tests. Only when the analysts  are sure
that the tablets  pass all the necessary  require-
ments are the tablets shipped  to retail stores.
Making  Connections
1. Why might consuming  more of the daily
RNI of a vitamin  or mineral  be harmful?
. The daily RNI of calcium  for adolescent
females  is 700 to 1100 mg. A supplement
tablet contains  950 mg of calcium  citrate.
Each gram of calcium  citrate contains
5.26 x 10° mol calcium. How many tablets
would  a 16-year-old  female  have to take to
meet her daily RNI?
An analyst  tests whether  tablets  will
sufficiently  dissolve  within a given time limit.
Converting  Between  Moles,  Mass, and Number  of Particles
You can use what you now know about the mole to carry out calculations
involving  molar mass and the Avogadro  constant.  One mole of any
compound  or element  contains  6.02 x 107° particles.  The compound  or
element  has a mass, in grams,  that is determined  from the periodic  table.
Now that you have learned  how the number  of particles,  number  of
moles, and mass of a substance  are related,  you can convert  from one
value to another.  Usually  chemists  convert  from moles to mass and from
mass to moles. Mass is a property  that can be measured  easily. The
following  graphic  shows the factors  used to convert  between  particles,
moles, and mass. Moles are a convenient  way to communicate  the amount
of a substance.

For example,  suppose  that you need 2.3 mol of potassium  chloride  to
carry out a reaction.  You need to convert  the molar amount  to mass so
that you can measure  the correct  amount  with a balance.
To be certain  you understand  the relationship  among  particles,  moles,
and mass, examine  the following  Sample  Problem.

H ow do chemists use what they know about molar masses? In Chapter 5,
you learned  how to use the periodic  table and the mole to relate the mass
of a compound  to the number  of particles  in the compound.  Chemists  can
use their understanding  of molar  mass to find out important  information
about compounds.
Sometimes  chemists  analyze  a compound  that is found in nature  to
learn how to produce  it more cheaply  in a laboratory.  For example,  con-
sider the flavour  used in vanilla  ice cream, which  may come from natural
or artificial  vanilla  extract.  Natural  vanilla  extract  is made from vanilla
seed pods, shown  on the left. The seed pods must be harvested  and
processed  before  being sold as vanilla  extract.  The scent and flavour  of
synthetic  vanilla  come from a compound  called vanillin,  which can be
produced  chemically  in bulk. Therefore  its production  is much cheaper.
Similarly,  many medicinal  chemicals  that are found in nature can be
produced  more cheaply  and efficiently  in a laboratory.
Suppose  that you want to synthesize  a compound  such as vanillin
in a laboratory.  You must first determine  the elements  in the compound.
Then you need to know the proportion  of each element  that is present.
This information,  along with your understanding  of molar mass, will help
you determine  the chemical  formula  of the compound.  Once you know
the chemical  formula,  you are on your way to finding  out how to produce
the compound.
In this chapter,  you will learn about the relationships  between  chemi-
cal formulas,  molar masses,  and the masses  of elements  in compounds.
The chemical  formula  of
vanillin  is CsH303.  How did
chemists  use information
about the masses  of carbon,
hydrogen,  and oxygen  in the
compound  to determine  this
formula?Chapter  Preview

198 MHR- Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
The mass of an element  in a compound,  expressed  as a percent  of the total
mass of the compound,  is the element’s  mass percent.  The mass percent
of hydrogen  in water from any of the sources  shown  in Figure 6.1 is
11.2%.  Similarly,  the mass percent  of oxygen  in water is always  88.8%.
Whether  the water sample  is distilled  from  a lake, an ice floe, or a drink-
ing fountain,  the hydrogen  and oxygen  in pure water are always  present
in these proportions.
Different  Compounds  from the Same Elements
The law of definite  proportions  does not imply that elements  in com-
pounds  are always  present  in the same relative  amounts.  It is possible  to
have different  compounds  made up of different  amounts  of the same ele-
ments. For example,  water, H20, and hydrogen  peroxide,  H2,O2, are both
made up of hydrogen  and oxygen.  Yet, as you can see in Figure 6.2, each
compound  has unique  properties.  Each compound  has a different  mass
percent  of oxygen  and hydrogen.  You may recognize  hydrogen  peroxide
as a household  chemical.  It is an oxidizing  agent that is used to bleach
hair and treat minor  cuts. It is also sold as an alternative  to chlorine  bleach.
Figure 6.3 shows a molecule  of benzene,  CgsHg. Benzene  contains
7.76% hydrogen  and 92.2% carbon  by mass. Octane,  CgHj3, is a major
component  of the fuel used for automobiles.  It contains  84.1% carbon
and 15.9% hydrogen.Soe
Chemical  formulas  such as CO
and CQ» reflect  an important
law called the /aw of multiple
proportions.  This law applies
when two elements  (such as
carbon and oxygen)  combine
to form two or more different
compounds.  In these cases,
the masses  of the element
(such as Q» in CO and CO)
that combine  with a fixed
amount  of the second element
are in ratios of small whole
numbers.  For example,  two
moles of carbon can combine
with one mole of oxygen  to
form carbon monoxide,  or with
two moles of oxygen  to form
carbon dioxide.  The ratio of the
two different  amounts  of
oxygen  that combine  with the
fixed amount  of carbon is 1:2.

presence  of manganese  dioxide.  Hydrogen  peroxide  is also composed  of hydrogen
and oxygen.  It is fairly unstable  and decomposes  vigorously  in the presence  of
manganese(IV)  oxide.
Similarly,  carbon  monoxide,  CO, and carbon  dioxide,  COz, are both
made up of carbon  and oxygen.  Yet each compound  is unique,  with its
own physical  and chemical  properties.  Carbon  dioxide  is a product  of
cellular  respiration  and the complete  combustion  of fossil fuels. Carbon
monoxide  is a deadly  gas formed  when insufficient  oxygen  is present
during  the combustion  of carbon-containing  compounds.  Carbon
monoxide  always  contains  42.88%  carbon  by mass. Carbon  dioxide
always  contains  27.29%  carbon  by mass.

Percentage  Composition
H Carbon  dioxide  and carbon  monoxide  contain  the same elements  but have
5.3% different  proportions  of these elements.  In other words,  they are composed
differently.  Chemists  express  the composition  of compounds  in various
ways. One way is to describe  how many moles of each element  make up a
mole of a compound.  For example,  one mole of carbon  dioxide  contains
one mole of carbon  and two moles of oxygen.  Another  way is to describe
the percent  mass of each element  in a compound.
The percentage  composition  of a compound  refers to the relative  mass
of each element  in the compound.  In other words,  percentage  composition
is a statement  of the values for mass percent  of every element  in the com-
pound.  For example,  the compound  vanillin,  CgHsO3,  has a percentage

experimentally,  and then used to help identify  the compound.

Calculating  Percentage  Composition  from a Chemical  Formula
In the previous  Practice  Problems,  you used mass data to calculate
percentage  composition.  This skill is useful for interpreting  experimental
data when the chemical  formula  is unknown.  Often, however,  the
percentage  composition  is calculated  from a known  chemical  formula.
This is useful when you are interested  in extracting  a certain  element
from a compound.  For example,  many metals,  such as iron and mercury,
exist in mineral  form. Mercury  is most often found in nature  as
mercury(II)  sulfide,  HgS. Knowing  the percentage  composition  of HgS
helps a metallurgist  predict  the mass of mercury  that can be extracted
from a sample  of HgS.
When determining  the percentage  composition  by mass of a
homogeneous  sample,  the size of the sample  does not matter.  According
to the law of definite  proportions,  there is a fixed proportion  of each
element  in the compound,  no matter  how much of the compound  you
have. This means  that you can choose  a convenient  sample  size when
calculating  percentage  composition  from a formula.
If you assume  that you have one mole of a compound,  you can use the
molar  mass of the compound,  with its chemical  formula,  to calculate  its
percentage  composition.  For example,  suppose  that you want to find the
202) MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
percentage  composition  of HgS. You can assume  that you have one mole
of HgS and find the mass percents  of mercury  and sulfur in one mole of
the compound.

Mass of 1 mol of HgS
_ 200.62

= 87.7%x 100% Mass percent  of Hg in HgS =
x 100%
Mercury(II)  sulfide  is 87.7% mercury  by mass. Since there are only two
elements  in HgS, you can subtract  the mass percent  of mercury  from
100 percent  to find the mass percent  of sulfur.
Mass percent  of S in HgS = 100% — 87.7% = 12.3%
Therefore,  the percentage  composition  of mercury(II)  sulfide  is
87.7% mercury  and 12.3% sulfur.
Sometimes  there are more than two elements  in a compound,  or
more than one atom of each element.  This makes determining  percentage
composition  more complex  than in the example  above. Work through
the Sample  Problem  below  to learn how to calculate  the percentage
composition  of a compound  from its molecular  formula.

The Empirical  Formula
of a Compound
As part of his atomic  theory,  John Dalton  stated that atoms combine  with
one another  in simple  whole  number  ratios to form compounds.  For
example,  the molecular  formula  of benzene,  CgH,, indicates  that one
molecule  of benzene  contains  6 carbon  atoms and 6 hydrogen  atoms. The
empirical  formula  (also known  as the simplest  formula)  of a compound
shows  the lowest  whole  number  ratio of the elements  in the compound.
The molecular  formula  (also known  as the actual formula)  describes  the
number  of atoms of each element  that make up a molecule  or formula
unit. Benzene,  with a molecular  formula  of CgsHg, has an empirical
formula  of CH. Table 6.1 shows  the molecular  formulas  of several
compounds,  along with their empirical  formulas.

ing point of 80°C. Acetylene,  C,H», has a molar  mass of 26 g/mol. It is a
highly  flammable  gas, commonly  used in a welder’s  torch. There is, in
fact, no existing  compound  with the molecular  formula  CH. The empirical
formula  of a compound  shows the lowest  whole
number  ratio of the atoms in the compound.  It
does not express  the composition  of a molecule.
Many compounds  have molecular  formulas
that are the same as their empirical  formulas.
One example  is ammonia,  NH3. Try to think of
three other examples.

Determining  a Compound's  Empirical  Formula
In the previous  section,  you learned  how to calculate  the percentage  com-
position  of a compound  from its chemical  formula.  Now you will do the
reverse.  You will use the percentage  composition  of a compound,  along
with the concept  of the mole, to calculate  the empirical  formula  of the
compound.  Since the percentage  composition  can often be determined  by
experiment,  chemists  use this calculation  when they want to identify
a compound.
The following  Sample  Problem  illustrates  how to use percentage  com-
position  to obtain  the empirical  formula  of a compound.

Problem
Calculate  the empirical  formula  of a compound  that is 85.6% carbon
and 14.4% hydrogen.
What Is Required?
You need to find the empirical  formula  of the compound.
What Is Given?
You know the percentage  composition  of the compound.  You have

Plan Your Strategy
Since you know the percentage  composition,  it is convenient  to
assume  that you have 100 g of the compound.  This means  that you
have 85.6 g of carbon  and 14.4 g of hydrogen.  Convert  each mass to
moles. The number  of moles can then be converted  into a lowest
terms ratio of the elements  to get the empirical  formula.

Tips for Solving  Empirical  Formula  Problems
In the Sample  Problem  above,  the numbers  were rounded  at each step to
simplify  the calculation.  To calculate  an empirical  formula  successfully,
however,  you should  not round  the numbers  until you have completed
the calculation.  Use the maximum  number  of significant  digits that your
calculator  will allow, throughout  the calculation.  Rounding  too soon when
calculating  an empirical  formula  may result in getting  the wrong  answer.it is unlikely  to be exact.

Determining  the Empirical  Formula  by Experiment
In practice,  you can determine  a compound’s  empirical  formula  by analyz-
ing its percentage  composition.  There are several  different  ways to do this.
One way is to use a synthesis  reaction  in which  a sample  of an element
with a known  mass reacts with another  element  to form a compound.
Since you know the mass of one of the elements  and you can measure
the mass of the compound  produced,  you can calculate  the percentage
composition.
For example,  copper  reacts with the oxygen  in air to form the
green compound  copper  oxide. Many  buildings  in Canada,  such as the
Parliament  buildings  in Ottawa,  have green roofs that contain  some
copper(II)  oxide. (See Figure 6.7.) Imagine  you have a 5.0 g sample  of
copper  shavings.  You allow the copper  shavings  to react completely  with
oxygen.  If the resulting  compound  has a mass of 6.3 g, you know that the
compound  contains  5.0 g copper  and 1.3 g oxygen.  Although  you can use
the periodic  table to predict  that the formula  for copper(II)  oxide is CuO,
the masses  help you confirm  your prediction.  Try converting  the masses
given above into an empirical  formula.
In Investigation  6-A, you will use a synthesis  reaction  to determine
the empirical  formula  of magnesium  oxide by experiment.PROBLEM  TIP
Notice that Table 6.2 suggests
multiplying  by 3 when you
obtain a subscript  ending in
.67, which is very close to .66.
\ J
Although  this green
roof may contain  some copper(II)
oxide, it is mostly  composed
of basic copper  sulfates  and
carbonates  that form when the
copper  reacts with acid
precipitation.

3. Obtain  a strip of magnesium,  about 8 cm long,
from your teacher.  Clean the magnesium  strip
with sandpaper  or emery  paper  to remove  any
oxide coating.
4. Measure  and record  the mass of the empty
crucible  and lid. Add the strip of cleaned
magnesium  to the crucible.  Record  the mass
of the crucible,  lid, and magnesium.
5. With the lid off, place the crucible  containing
the magnesium  on the clay triangle.  Heat the
crucible  with a strong  flame. Using the cru-
cible tongs, hold the lid of the crucible  nearby.
GATED  When the magnesium  ignites,  quickly
cover the crucible  with the lid. Continue
heating  for about 1 min.
6. Carefully  remove  the lid. Heat the
crucible  until the magnesium  ignites  once
more. Again,  quickly  cover the crucible.
Repeat  this heating  and covering  of the cru-
cible until the magnesium  no longer  ignites.
Heat for a further  4 to 5 min with the lid off.
7. Using the crucible  tongs, put the crucible  on
the ceramic  pad to cool.
8. When  the crucible  is cool enough  to touch,  put
it on the bench.  Carefully  grind the product
into small particles  using the glass rod. Rinse
any particles  on the glass rod into the crucible
with distilled  water from the wash bottle.
9. Add enough  distilled  water to the crucible  to
thoroughly  wet the contents.  The white prod-
uct is magnesium  oxide. The yellowish-orange
product  is magnesium  nitride.
10. Return  the crucible  to the clay triangle.  Place
the lid slightly  ajar. Heat the crucible  gently
until the water begins  to boil. Continue  heat-
ing until all the water has evaporated,  and the
product  is completely  dry. Allow  the crucible
to cool on the ceramic  pad.
11. Using the crucible  tongs, carry the crucible
and lid to the balance.  Measure  and record  the
mass of the crucible  and lid.

of these athletes  tested positive  for performance-

International  Olympic  Committee  (IOC). Who
conducts  the tests for these substances?  Meet
Dr. Christiane  Ayotte,  head of Canada’s  Doping
Control  Laboratory  since 1991.
The Doping Control  Lab
What happens  to a urine sample  after it arrives  at
the doping  control lab? Technicians  and scientists
must be careful  to ensure  careful handling  of the
sample.  Portions  of the sample  are taken for six
different  analytical  procedures.  More than 150
substances  are banned  by the IOC. These sub-
stances  are grouped  according  to their physical
and chemical  properties.  There are two main
steps for analyzing  a sample:
1. purification,  which involves  steps such as
filtration  and extraction  using solvents,  and
2. analysis  by either gas chromatography,  mass
spectrometry,  or high-performance  liquid
chromatography.  Chromatography  refers to
certain methods  by which chemists  separate
mixtures  into pure substances.For most substances,  just their presence  in a
urine sample  means  a positive  result. Other
substances  must be present  in an amount  higher
than a certain  threshold.  According  to Dr. Ayotte,
a male athlete  would have to consume  “10 very
strong French  coffees  within 15 min” to go over
the 12 mg/L limit for caffeine.  Ephedrines  and
pseudoephedrines,  two decongestants  that are
found in cough remedies  and that act as stimu-
lants, have a cut-off  level. This allows  athletes
to take them up to one or two days before a
competition.
Challenges
Dr. Ayotte  and her team face many challenges.
They look for reliable  tests for natural  substances,
develop  new analytical  techniques,  and deter-
mine the normal  levels of banned  substances
for male and female  athletes.  Dr. Ayotte must
defend her tests in hearings  and with the press,
especially  when high-profile  athletes  get positive
results.  Her dreams  include  an independent
international  doping  control  agency  and better
drug-risk  education  for athletes.
For Dr. Ayotte,  integrity  and a logical mind
are essential  aspects  of being a good scientist.

Thus, the molar mass of a compound  is a whole number  multiple  of the
“molar  mass” of the empirical  formula.
Chemists  can use a mass spectrometer  to determine  the molar mass of a
compound.  They can use the molar  mass, along with the “molar  mass” of a
known  empirical  formula,  to determine  the compound’s  molecular  formula.
For example,  the empirical  formula  CH has a “molar  mass” of 13 g/mol. We

have developed  other methods  for analyzing  different  types of
compounds,  as you will learn in this section.
The Carbon-Hydrogen  Combustion  Analyzer
A large number  of important  chemicals  are composed  of hydrogen,
carbon,  and oxygen.  The carbon-hydrogen  combustion  analyzer  is a
useful instrument  for analyzing  these chemicals.  It allows chemists  to
determine  the percentage  composition  of compounds  that are made up
of carbon,  hydrogen,  and oxygen.  The applications  of this instrument
include  forensic  science,  food chemistry,  pharmaceuticals  and academic
research — anywhere  that an unknown  compound  needs to be analyzed.
The carbon-hydrogen  combustion  analyzer  works  because  we know
that compounds  containing  carbon  and hydrogen  will burn in a stream  of
pure oxygen,  On», to yield only carbon  dioxide  and water. If we can find
the mass of the carbon  dioxide  and water separately,  we can determine
the mass percent  of carbon  and hydrogen  in the compound.
Examine  Figure 6.8 to see how a carbon-hydrogen  combustion  analyz-
er works.  A sample,  made up of only carbon  and hydrogen,  is placed  in a

water vapour  and carbon  dioxide.
The water vapour  is collected  by passing  it through  a tube that con-
tains magnesium  perchlorate,  Mg(ClO,)2.  The magnesium  perchlorate
absorbs  all of the water. The mass of the tube is determined  before and
after the reaction.  The difference  is the mass of the water that is produced
in the reaction.  We know that all the hydrogen  in the sample  is converted
to water. Therefore,  we can use the percentage  composition  of hydrogen
in water to determine  the mass of the hydrogen  in the sample.
The carbon  dioxide  is captured  in a second  tube, which contains
sodium  hydroxide,  NaOH. The mass of this tube is also measured  before
and after the reaction.  The increase  in the mass of the tube corresponds
to the mass of the carbon  dioxide  that is produced.  We know that all the
carbon  in the sample  reacts to form carbon  dioxide.  Therefore,  we can use
the percentage  composition  of carbon  in carbon  dioxide  to determine  the
mass of the carbon  in the sample.
The carbon-hydrogen  combustion  analyzer  can also be used to find
the empirical  formula  of a compound  that contains  carbon,  hydrogen,

Chemistry  Bulletin
All chemists  who try to identify  unknown
compounds  are like detectives.  Forensic
chemists,  however,  actually  work with investi-
gators. They use their chemical  knowledge  to
help explain  evidence.  Forensic  chemists  are
especially  helpful  in an arson investigation.
Investigating  Arson
One of the main jobs of the investigator  in a
possible  arson case is to locate and sample
residual  traces of accelerants.  Accelerants  are
flammable  substances  that are used to quickly
ignite and spread  a fire. They include  com-
pounds  called  hydrocarbons,  which  contain
hydrogen  and carbon.  Examples  of hydrocar-
bons include  petrol,  kerosene  and diesel.
Portable  instruments  called sniffers  can be
used to determine  the best places to collect
samples.  These sniffers,  however,  are not able
to determine  the type of hydrocarbon  present.
As well, they can be set off by vapours  from
burnt plastics.  Deciding  whether  or not a sub-
stance is an accelerant  is best done by a
chemist  in a laboratory,  using a technique
called gas chromatography  (GC).
222 MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical  QuantitiesIn the Forensic  Laboratory
In the laboratory,  the sample  residue  must be
concentrated  on charcoal  or another  material.
Then the sample  is ready for GC analysis.  GC
is used to separate  and detect  trace amounts  of
volatile  hydrocarbons  and separate  them from
a mixture.  Most accelerants  are complex
mixtures.  They have many components,  in
different  but specific  ratios.
GC involves  taking  the concentrated
residue  and passing  it through  a gas column.
As the sample  residue  moves  through  the col-
umn, the different  components  separate  based
on their boiling  points.  The compound  with
the lowest  boiling  point emerges  from the
column  and onto a detector  first. The other
components  follow  as they reach their boiling
points.  It is possible  to identify  each compo-
nent of a mixture  based on the time that it
emerges  from the column.  A detector  records
this information  on a chromatogram.  Each
component  is represented  by a peak on a
graph. The overall  pattern  of peaks is always
the same for a specific  type of accelerant.
Therefore,  accelerants  are identified  by their
components  and the relative  proportions  of
their components.
Only trace amounts  of an accelerant  need
to be collected  because  current  analytical  tools
are extremely  sensitive.  If an accelerant  is used
to start a fire, it is highly  likely that there will
be trace amounts  left over after the fire. The
presence  of an accelerant  at a fire scene strongly
suggests  that the fire was started  intentionally.
Making  Connections
1. What other types of crime could be solved
by a forensic  chemist?  Brainstorm  a list.
2. What other instruments  might a forensic
chemist  use to identify  compounds?  Using
the Internet  or reference  books, do some
research  to find out.
Hydrated  lonic Compounds
You have learned  how to find the molecular  formula  of a compound  that
contains  only hydrogen,  carbon,  and oxygen.  When chemists  use this
method,  they usually  have no mass percent  data for the compound  when
they begin. In some cases, however,  chemists  know most of the molecular
formula  of a compound,  but one significant  piece of information  is
missing.
For example,  many ionic compounds  crystallize  from a water solution
with water molecules  incorporated  into their crystal  structure,  forming  a
hydrate.  Hydrates  have a specific  number  of water molecules  chemically
bonded  to each formula  unit. A chemist  may know the formula  of the
ionic part of the hydrate  but not how many water molecules  are present
for each formula  unit.
Epsom  salts, for example,  consist  of crystals  of magnesium  sulfate
heptahydrate,  MgSO,:7H.O.  Every formula  unit of magnesium  sulfate  has
seven molecules  of water weakly  bonded  to it. A raised dot in a chemical
formula,  in front of one or more water molecules,  denotes  a hydrated
compound.  Note that the dot does not include  multiplication,  but rather  a
weak bond between  an ionic compound  and one or more water molecules.
Some other examples  of hydrates  are shown  in Table 6.4.
Compounds  that have no water molecules  incorporated  into them
are called anhydrous  to distinguish  them from their hydrated  forms. For
example,  a chemist  might refer to CaSO, as anhydrous  calcium  sulfate.
This is because  it is often found in hydrated  form as calcium  sulfate
dihydrate,  shown  in Figure 6.9.
Table 6.4 Selected  Hydrates
Formula | Chemical  name
CaSO,4-2H,0 calcium  sulfate  dihydrate  (gypsum)
CaCl, -2H,O calcium  chloride  dihydrate
LiCl,-4H,O lithium  chloride  tetrahydrate

Na,CO3-10H2O sodium  carbonate  decahydrate
KAI(SQ,q)2:12H2,0  potassium  aluminum  sulfate  dodecahydrate  (alum)
The molar  mass of a hydrated  compound  must include  the mass of any
water molecules  that are in the compound.  For example,  the molar  mass
of magnesium  sulfate  heptahydrate  includes  the mass of 7 mol of water.
It is very important  to know whether  a compound  exists as a hydrate.  For
example,  if a chemical  reaction  calls for 0.25 mol of copper(II)  chloride,
you need to know whether  you are dealing  with anhydrous  copper(I])
chloride  or with copper(II)  chloride  dihydrate,  shown  in Figure 6.10. The
mass of 0.25 mol of CuCl, is 33.61 g. The mass of 0.25 mol of CuCl,-2H,O
is 38.11 g.
Calculations  involving  hydrates  involve  using the same techniques
you have already  practised  for determining  percent  by mass, empirical
formulas,  and molecular  formulas.
The following  Sample  Problem  shows how to find the percent  by mass
of water in a hydrate.  It also shows  how to determine  the formula

Determining  the Molecular  Formula  of a Hydrate
As you have just discovered,  calculations  involving  hydrates  usually
involve  comparing  the anhydrous  form of the ionic compound  to the
hydrated  form. Many chemicals  are available  in hydrated  form. Usually
chemists  are only interested  in how much of the ionic part of the hydrate
they are working  with. This is because,  in most reactions  involving
hydrates,  the water portion  of the compound  does not take part in the
reaction.  Only the ionic portion  does.
How do chemists  determine  how many water molecules  are bonded  to
each ionic formula  unit in a hydrate?  One method  is to heat the com-
pound  in order to convert  it to its anhydrous  form. The bonds that join
the water molecules  to the ionic compound  are very weak compared  with
the strong ionic bonds within  the ionic compound.  Heating  a hydrate  usu-
ally removes  the water molecules,  leaving  the anhydrous  compound
behind.  In Investigation  6-B, you will heat a hydrate  to determine
its formula.PROBLEM  TIP

Section  Wrap-up
In section  6.4, you learned  several  practical  methods  for determining
empirical  and molecular  formulas  of compounds.  You may have noticed
that these methods  work because  compounds  react in predictable  ways.
For example,  you learned  that a compound  containing  carbon  and
hydrogen  reacts with oxygen  to produce  water and carbon  dioxide.  From
the mass of the products,  you can determine  the amount  of carbon  and
hydrogen  in the reactant.  You also learned  that a hydrate  decomposes
when it is heated  to form water and an anhydrous  compound.  Again,  the
mass of one of the products  of this reaction  helps you identify  the reactant.
In Chapter  7, you will learn more about how to use the information  from
chemical  reactions  in order to do quantitative  calculations.
Section  Review

in the CO, absorber?

Chemical  Reactions
A spacecraft,  such as the space shuttle on the left, requires a huge
amount  of fuel to supply  the thrust needed  to launch  it into orbit.
Engineers  work very hard to minimize  the launch  mass of a spacecraft
because  each kilogram  requires  additional  fuel. As well, each kilogram
costs thousands  of dollars  to launch.
In 1969, the Apollo  11 space mission  was the first to land astronauts
on the Moon. The engineers  on the project  faced a challenge  when decid-
ing on a fuel for the lunar module.  The lunar module  took the astronauts
from the Moon,  back to the command  module  that was orbiting  the Moon.
The engineers  chose  a fuel consisting  of hydrazine,  N2H,, and dinitrogen
tetroxide,  N.O,. These compounds,  when mixed,  reacted  instantaneously
and produced  the energy  needed  to launch  the lunar module  from
the Moon.
How do engineers  know how much of each reactant  they need for
a chemical  reaction?  In this chapter,  you will use the concept  of the
mole to calculate  the amounts  of reactants  that are needed  to produce
given amounts  of products.  You will learn how to predict  the amounts
of products  that will be produced  in a chemical  reaction.  You will also
learn how to apply this knowledge  to any chemical  reaction  for which
you know the balanced  chemical  equation.  Finally,  you will learn how
calculated  amounts  deviate  from the amounts  in real-life  situations.
How can you use the balanced  equation
below  to calculate  the amount  of fuel
needed  to propel a lunar module  back
to a command  module?

Balanced  chemical  equations  are essential  for making  calculations  related
to chemical  reactions.  To understand  why, consider  the following  analogy.
Imagine  that you are making  salads.  You need one head of lettuce,  two
cucumbers,  and five radishes  for each salad. Figure 7.1 shows how you
can express  this as an equation.

A salad analogy  showing  how equations  can be multiplied
Now imagine  that you are making  two salads.  How much of each
ingredient  do you need? You need twice the amount  that you used
to make one salad, as shown  in Figure 7.1.
How many salads can you make if you have three heads of lettuce,
six cucumbers,  and 15 radishes?  According  to the salad equation,  you can
make three salads.
You can get the same kind of information  from a balanced  chemical
equation.  In Chapter  4, you learned  how to classify  chemical  reactions
and balance  the chemical  equations  that describe  them. In Chapters  5 and
6, you learned  how chemists  relate the number  of particles  in a substance
to the amount  of the substance  in moles and grams. In this section,  you
will use your knowledge  to interpret  the information  in a chemical  equa-
tion, in terms of particles,  moles,  and mass. Try the following  Express  Lab

Safety Precautions
Be careful  when using concentrated
hydrochloric  acid. It burns skin and clothing.
Do not inhale its vapour.
Procedure
1. Obtain a sample  of sodium  hydrogen
carbonate  that is approximately  1.0 g.
2. Place a 24-well  microplate  on a balance.
Measure  and record its mass.
3. Place all the sodium  hydrogen  carbonate  in
well A4 of the microplate.  Measure  and record
the mass of the microplate  and sample.
4. Fill a thin-stem  pipette  with 8 mol/L
hydrochloric  acid solution.
5. Wipe the outside  of the pipette.  Stand it,
stem up, in well A3.
6. Measure  and record  the total mass of the
microplate  and sample.
7. Add the hydrochloric  acid from the pipette
to the sodium  hydrogen  carbonate  in well A4.
Allow  the gas to escape  after each drop.8. Continue  to add the hydrochloric  acid until all
the sodium  hydrogen  carbonate  has dissolved
and the solution  produces  no more bubbles.
9. Return  the pipette,  stem up, to well A3. Again
find the total mass of the microplate  and
samples.
10. Dispose  of the reacted  chemicals  as directed
by your teacher.
Analysis
1. Calculate  the number  of moles of sodium
hydrogen  carbonate  used.
2. Find the difference  between  the total mass of
the microplate  and samples  before  and after
the reaction.  This difference  represents  the
mass of carbon  dioxide  gas produced.
3. Calculate  the number  of moles of carbon
dioxide  produced.
4, Express  your answers  to questions  1 and 3 as
a mole ratio of mol NaHCO3:mol  CO>.
5. According  to the balanced  equation,
how many molecules  of sodium  hydrogen
carbonate  react to form one molecule  of
carbon  dioxide?
(a) Express  your answer  as a ratio.
(b) Compare  this ratio to your mole ratio in
question  4.
6. How many moles of carbon  dioxide  do you
think would be formed  from 4.0 mol of sodium

You can use your understanding  of the relationship  between  moles
and number  of particles  to see how chemical  equations  communicate
information  about how many moles of products  and reactants  are
involved  in a reaction.
Particle  Relationships  in a Balanced  Chemical  Equation
As you learned  in Chapter  4, the coefficients  in front of compounds  and
elements  in chemical  equations  tell you how many atoms and molecules
participate  in a reaction.  A chemical  equation  can tell you much more,
however.  Consider,  for example,  the equation  that describes  the produc-
tion of ammonia.  Ammonia  is an important  industrial  chemical.  Several
of its uses are shown  in Figure 7.2 on the following  page.
Chapter  7 Quantities  in Chemical  Reactions  * MHR 235

This equation  tells you that one molecule  of nitrogen  gas reacts with
three molecules  of hydrogen  gas to form two molecules  of ammonia  gas.
As you can see in Figure 7.3, there is the same number  of each type
of atom on both sides of the equation.
You can use a ratio to express  the numbers  of atoms in the equation,
as follows:
1 molecule  Nz: 3 molecules  H2: 2 molecules  NH3
What happens  if you multiply  the ratio by 2? You get
2 molecules  N2: 6 molecules  H2: 4 molecules  NH3
This means  that two molecules  of nitrogen  gas react with six molecules  of
hydrogen  gas to produce  four molecules  of ammonia  gas. Multiplying  the
original  ratio by one dozen  gives the following  relationship:
1 dozen  molecules  Nz: 3 dozen molecules  Hz: 2 dozen molecules  NH;
Suppose  that you want to produce  20 molecules  of ammonia.  How
many molecules  of nitrogen  do you need? You know that you need one
molecule  of nitrogen  for every two molecules  of ammonia  produced.  In
other words,  the number  of molecules  of nitrogen  that you need is one
half the number  of molecules  of ammonia  that you want to produce.

Mole Relationships  in Chemical  Equations
Until now, you have assumed  that the coefficients  in a chemical  equation
represent  particles.  They can, however,  also represent  moles. Consider  the
following  ratio to find out why.
1 molecule  N2: 3 molecules  H,: 2 molecules  NH3
You can multiply  the above ratio by the Avogadro  constant  to obtain
1 x Na molecules  Nz: 3 X Na molecules  Hz: 2 x Na molecules  NH3
This is the same as
1 mol Nz: 3 mol He: 2 mol NH;
So the chemical  equation  Nog) + 3Hag) > 2NH3) also means that
1 mol of nitrogen  molecules  reacts with 3 mol of hydrogen  molecules  to
form 2 mol of ammonia  molecules.  The relationships  between  moles in a
balanced  chemical  equation  are called mole ratios. For example,  the mole
ratio of nitrogen  to hydrogen  in the equation  above is 1 mol N2:3 mol Hz.
The mole ratio of hydrogen  to ammonia  is 3 mol Hz:2 mol NHs3.
Chapter  7 Quantities  in Chemical  Reactions  » MHR 237
You can manipulate  mole ratios in the same way that you can manip-
ulate ratios involving  molecules.  For example,  suppose  that you want to
know how many moles of ammonia  are produced  by 2.8 mol of hydrogen.
You know that you can obtain 2 mol of ammonia  for every 3 mol of
hydrogen.  Therefore,  you multiply  the number  of moles of hydrogen  by
the mole ratio of ammonia  to hydrogen.  Another  way to think about this
is to equate  the known  mole ratio of hydrogen  to ammonia  to the
unknown  mole ratio of hydrogen  to ammonia  and solve for the unknown.

Different  Ratios of Reactants
The relative  amounts  of reactants  are important.  Different  mole ratios of
the same reactants  can produce  different  products.  For example,  carbon
can combine  with oxygen  in two different  ratios, forming  either carbon
monoxide  or carbon  dioxide.  In the following  reaction,  the mole ratio of
carbon  to oxygen  is 2 mol C:1 mol Oz.
2C is) + Ore) > 2COw)
In the next reaction,  the mole ratio of carbon  to oxygen  is
1 mol C:1 mol Os.
Cis) + Ox(g) + CO2(g)
Thus, carbon  dioxide  forms if carbon  and oxygen  are present  in a mole
ratio of about 1 mol C:1 mol O2. Carbon  dioxide  is a product  of cellular
respiration  in animals  and humans,  and it is a starting  material  for photo-
synthesis.  It is also one of the products  of the complete  combustion  of a
hydrocarbon  fuel.
If there is a relative  shortage  of oxygen,  however,  and the mole ratio
of carbon  to oxygen  is closer to 2 mol C:1 mol O, carbon  monoxide  forms.
Carbon  monoxide  is colourless,  tasteless,  and odourless.  It is a highly
poisonous  gas, that is responsible  for the deaths of hundreds  of people
in Canada  and the United  States every year. Carbon  monoxide  can escape
from any fuel-burning  appliance:  furnace,  water heater,  fireplace,  wood
stove, or space heater. If you have one of these appliances  in your home,
make sure that it has a good supply  of oxygen  to avoid the formation  of
carbon  monoxide.
There are many reactions  in which  different  mole ratios of the reactants
result in different  products.  The following  Sample  Problem  will help you
understand  how to work with these reactions.

Mass Relationships  in Chemical  Equations
As you have learned,  the coefficients  in a balanced  chemical  equation  rep-
resent  moles as well as particles.  Therefore,  you can use the molar masses
of reactants  and products  to determine  the mass ratios for a reaction.  For
example,  consider  the equation  for the formation  of ammonia:
Na) + 3H) > 2NH3¢)
CHECKP INT You can find the mass of each substance  using the equation  m = M x n
as follows:Refer back to Chapter  5.
Calculate  the molar mass 1 mol Nz x 28.0 g/mol N, = 28.0 gN,
of No, Hp, and NH3.3 mol H, x 2.02 g/mol H, = 6.1 g H,
2 mol NH x 17.0 g/mol NH, = 34.1 g NH,
In Table 7.1, you can see how particles,  moles,  and mass are related  in a
chemical  equation.  Notice  that the mass of the product  is equal to the
total mass of the reactants.  This confirms  the law of conservation  of mass.

Stoichiometric  Mass Calculations
You now know what a balanced  chemical  equation  tells you in terms
of number  of particles,  number  of moles,  and mass of products  and
reactants.  How do you use this information?  Because  reactants  and
products  are related  by a fixed ratio, if you know the number  of moles
of one substance,  the balanced  equation  tells you the number  of moles
of all the other substances.  In Chapters  5 and 6, you learned  how to
convert  between  particles,  moles,  and mass. Therefore,  ifyou know the
amount  of one substance  in a chemical  reaction  (in particles,  moles, or
mass),  you can calculate  the amount  of any other substance  in the
reaction  (in particles,  moles, or mass), using the information  in the
balanced  chemical  equation.
You can see that a balanced  chemical  equation  is a powerful  tool. It
allows chemists  to predict  the amount  of products  that will result from a
reaction  involving  a known  amount  of reactants.  As well, chemists  can
use a balanced  equation  to calculate  the amount  of reactants  they will
need to produce  a desired  amount  of products.  They can also use it to
predict  the amount  of one reactant  they will need to react completely
with another  reactant.

The word “stoichiometry”  is
and metron,  meaning  “to
measure.”  What other words
might be derived  from the
Greek word metron?Language LINK
derived  from two Greek  words:
stoikheion,  meaning  “element,”
The concept  of stoichiometry
was first described  in 1792 by
the German  scientist  Jeremias
Benjamin  Richter  (1762-1807).
He stated that “stoichiometry
is the science  of measuring
the quantitative  proportions  or
mass ratios in which chemical
elements  stand to one anoth-
er.” Can you think of another
reason  why Richter  was
famous?Stoichiometry  is the study of the relative  quantities  of reactants  and
products  in chemical  reactions.  Stoichiometric  calculations  are used
for many purposes.  One purpose  is determining  how much of a reactant  is
needed  to carry out a reaction.  This kind of knowledge  is useful for any
chemical  reaction,  and it can even be a matter  of life or death.
In a spacecraft,  for example,  carbon  dioxide  is produced  as the astro-
nauts breathe.  To maintain  a low level of carbon  dioxide,  air in the cabin
is passed  continuously  through  canisters  of lithium  hydroxide  granules.
The carbon  dioxide  reacts with the lithium  hydroxide  in the following
way:
COx(g) + 2LIOH(s) > LizCO3(s)  + H2O0¢)
The canisters  are changed  periodically  as the lithium  hydroxide  reacts.
Engineers  must calculate  the amount  of lithium  hydroxide  needed  to
ensure  that the carbon  dioxide  level is safe. As you learned  earlier,  every
kilogram  counts  in space travel. Therefore,  a spacecraft  cannot  carry much
more than the minimum  amount.
A spacecratt  is a closed  system.  All chemical  reactions  must be taken into
account  when engineers  design systems  to keep the air breathable.
To determine  how much lithium  hydroxide  is needed,  engineers  need to
ask and answer  two important  questions:
e How much carbon  dioxide  is produced  per astronaut  each day?
e How much lithium  hydroxide  is needed  per kilogram  of carbon
dioxide?
Engineers  can answer  the first question  by experimenting.  To answer  the
second  question,  they need to do stoichiometric  calculations.  Examine  the
following  Sample  Problems  to see how these calculations  would  be done.

A General  Process  for Solving  Stoichiometric  Problems
You have just solved several  stoichiometric  problems.  In these problems,
masses  of products  and reactants  were given, and masses  were also
required  for the answers.  Chemists  usually  need to know what mass
of reactants  they require  and what mass of products  they can expect.
Sometimes,  however,  a question  requires  you to work with the number
of moles or particles.  Use the same process  for solving  stoichiometric
problems,  whether  you are working  with mass, moles,  or particles:
Step1 Write a balanced  chemical  equation.
Step 2 If you are given the mass or number  of particles  of a substance,
convert  it to the number  of moles.
Step 3 Calculate  the number  of moles of the required  substance  based
on the number  of moles of the given substance,  using the
appropriate  mole ratio.
Step 4 Convert  the number  of moles of the required  substance  to mass
or number  of particles,  as directed  by the question.
Examine  the following  Sample  Problem  to see how to work with mass
and particles.

Section  Wrap-up
You have learned  how to do stoichiometric  calculations,  using balanced
chemical  equations  to find amounts  of reactants  and products.  In these
calculations,  you assumed  that the reactants  and products  occurred  in the
exact molar ratios shown  by the chemical  equation.  In real life, however,
reactants  are often not present  in these exact ratios. Similarly,  the amount
of product  that is predicted  by stoichiometry  is not always  produced.
In the next two sections,  you will learn how chemists  deal with these
challenges.

The Limiting  Reactant
A balanced  chemical  equation  shows  the mole ratios of the reactants
and products.  To emphasize  this, the coefficients  of equations  are some-
times called stoichiometric  coefficients.  Reactants  are said to be present
in stoichiometric  amounts  when they are present  in a mole ratio that
corresponds  exactly  to the mole ratio predicted  by the balanced  chemical
equation.  This means  that when  a reaction  is complete,  there are no
reactants  left. In practice,  however,  there often are reactants  left.
In the previous  section,  you looked  at an “equation”  for making  a

What if you have two heads of lettuce,  12 cucumbers,  and 25 radishes,

If you were carrying  out this reaction  in a laboratory,  you could obtain
samples  of zinc oxide and carbon  in a 1:1 mole ratio. In an industrial
setting,  however,  it is impractical  to spend time and money  ensuring  that
zinc oxide and carbon  are present  in stoichiometric  amounts.  It is also
unnecessary.  In an industrial  setting,  engineers  add more carbon,  in the
form of charcoal,  than is necessary  for the reaction.  All the zinc oxide

Determining  the Limiting  Reactant
The reactant  that is completely  used up in a chemical  reaction  is called
the limiting  reactant.  In other words,  the limiting  reactant  determines
how much product  is produced.  When  the limiting  reactant  is used up,
the reaction  stops. In real-life  situations,  there is almost  always  a limiting
reactant.
A reactant  that remains  after a reaction  is over is called  the excess
reactant.  Once the limiting  reactant  is used, no more product  can be
made, regardless  of how much of the excess  reactants  may be present.
252. MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
When  you are given amounts  of two or more reactants  to solve a
stoichiometric  problem,  you first need to identify  the limiting  reactant.
One way to do this is to find out how much product  would  be produced
by each reactant  if the other reactant  were present  in excess.  The reactant
that produces  the least amount  of product  is the limiting  reactant.
Examine  the following  Sample  Problem  to see how to use this approach  to
identify  the limiting  reactant.

hydroxide,  according  to the following  balanced  chemical  equation:

If 4.87 g of lithium  nitride  reacts with 5.80 g of water, find the
limiting  reactant.
What Is Required?
You need to determine  whether  lithium  nitride  or water is the
limiting  reactant.
What Is Given?

The water would  produce  less ammonia  than the lithium  nitride.
Therefore,  the limiting  reactant  is water. Notice  that there is more
water than lithium  nitride,  in terms of mass and moles. Water is the
limiting  reactant,  however,  because  3 mol of water are needed  to
react with 1 mol of lithium  nitride.
Check Your Solution
According  to the balanced  chemical  equation,  the ratio of lithium
nitride  to water is 1/3. The ratio of lithium  nitride  to water, based
on the mole amounts  calculated,  is 0.14:0.32.  Divide  this ratio by
0.14 to get 1.0:2.3.  For each mole of lithium  nitride,  there are only
2.3 mol water. However,  3 mol are required  by stoichiometry.
Therefore,  water is the limiting  reactant.

The Limiting  Reactant  in Stoichiometric  Problems
You are now ready to use what you know about  finding  the limiting  reac-
tant to predict  the amount  of product  that is expected  in a reaction.  This
type of prediction  is a routine  part of a chemist’s  job, both in academic
research  and industry.  To produce  a compound,  for example,  chemists
need to know how much product  they can expect  from a given reaction.
In analytical  chemistry,  chemists  often analyze  an impure  substance  by
allowing  it to react in a known  reaction.  They predict  the expected  mass
of the product(s)  and compare  it with the actual mass of the product(s)
obtained.  Then they can determine  the purity of the compound.
Since chemical  reactions  usually  occur with one or more of the
reactants  in excess,  you often need to determine  the limiting  reactant
before you carry out stoichiometric  calculations.  You can incorporate
this step into the process  you have been using to solve stoichiometric
problems,  as shown  in Figure 7.7.halan vs |} AMiIral  aval

two reactants  and you want to
use up all of one reactant,
which is the limiting reactant?
Carbon disulfide,  CS», is an
extremely  volatile and flamma-
ble substance.  It is so flamma-
ble that it can ignite when
exposed  to boiling water!
Because  carbon disulfide
vapour  is more than twice as
dense as air, it can “blanket”
the floor of a laboratory.  There
have been cases where the
spark from an electrical  motor
has ignited carbon  disulfide
vapour  in a laboratory,  causing
considerable  damage.  For this
reason,  specially  insulated
electrical  motors are required
in laboratory  refrigerators  and

Section  Wrap-up
You now know how to identify  a limiting  reactant.  This allows  you to
predict  the amount  of product  that will be formed  in a reaction.  Often,
however,  your prediction  will not accurately  reflect  reality.  When a
chemical  reactions  occurs—  whether in a laboratory,  in nature,  or in
industry  —the amount  of product  that is formed  is often different  from
the amount  that was predicted  by stoichiometric  calculations.  You will
learn why this happens,  and how chemists  deal with it, in section  7.3.

will learn about a percentage  that chemists  use to predict  and express  the
“success”  of reactions.
A baseball  player's  batting  average  is calculated  as hits/attempts.  For
example,  a player  with 6 hits for 21 times at bat has a batting  average  of 6/21 = 0.286.
This represents  a success  rate of 28.6%.
Theoretical  Yield and Actual Yield
Chemists  use stoichiometry  to predict  the amount  of product  that can
be expected  from a chemical  reaction.  The amount  of product  that is
predicted  by stoichiometry  is called the theoretical  yield. This predicted
yield, however,  is not always  the same as the amount  of product  that is
Actual  yield is a measured
quantity.  Theoretical  yield is a
calculated  quantity.actually  obtained  from a chemical  reaction.  The amount  of product  that
is obtained  in an experiment  is called the actual  yield.
Why Actual  Yield and Theoretical  Yield Are Often Different
The actual yield of chemical  reactions  is usually  less than the theoretical
yield. This is caused  by a variety  of factors.  For example,  sometimes  less
than perfect  collection  techniques  contribute  to a lower  than expected
yield.
A reduced  yield may also be caused  by a competing  reaction:  a
reaction  that occurs  at the same time as the principal  reaction  and
involves  its reactants  and/or  products.  For example,  phosphorus  reacts
with chlorine  to form phosphorus  trichloride.  Some of the phosphorus
trichloride,  however,  can then react with chlorine  to form phosphorus
pentachloride.
260 MHR-= Unit 2 Chemical  Quantities
Here are the chemical  equations  for these competing  reactions
2P(s) + 3Clag) > 2PCls3 (0)
Therefore,  not all the phosphorus  is converted  to phosphorus
trichloride.  So the actual yield of phosphorus  trichloride  is less than
the theoretical  yield.
Experimental  design  and technique  may affect the actual yield, as
well. For example,  suppose  that you need to obtain  a product  by filtration.
Some of the product  may remain  in solution  and therefore  not be caught
on the filter paper.
Another  common  cause of reduced  yield is impure  reactants.  The
theoretical  yield is calculated  based on the assumption  that reactants  are
pure. You will learn about the effects  of impure  reactants  on page 265.
Calculating  Percentage  Yield
The percentage  yield of a chemical  reaction  compares  the mass of product
obtained  by experiment  (the actual yield) with the mass of product
determined  by stoichiometric  calculations  (the theoretical  yield).  It is
calculated  as follows:
Actual  yield
Theoretical  yieldPercentage  yield = ( ) x 100%
In section  7.1, you looked  at the reaction  of hydrogen  and nitrogen
to produce  ammonia.  You assumed  that all the nitrogen  and hydrogen
reacted.  Under certain  conditions  of temperature  and pressure,  this is a
reasonable  assumption.  When ammonia  is produced  industrially,  how-
ever, temperature  and pressure  are manipulated  to maximize  the speed
of production.  Under  these conditions,  the actual yield is much less than
the theoretical  yield. Examine  the next Sample  Problem  to learn how to
calculate  percentage  yield.

Applications  of Percentage  Yield
The percentage  yield of chemical  reactions  is extremely  important  in
industrial  chemistry  and the pharmaceutical  industry.  For example,  the
synthesis  of certain  drugs involves  many sequential  chemical  reactions.
Often each reaction  has a low percentage  yield. This results  in a tiny
overall  yield. Research  chemists,  who generally  work with small quanti-
ties of reactants,  may be satisfied  with a poor yield. Chemical  engineers,
on the other hand, work with very large quantities.  They may use hun-
dreds or even thousands  of kilograms  of reactants!  A difference  of 1%
in the yield of a reaction  can translate  into thousands  of dollars.
The work of a chemist  in a laboratory  can be likened  to making
spaghetti  for a family.  The work of a chemical  engineer,  by contrast,  is like
making  spaghetti  for 10 000 people!  Learn more about chemical  engineers
in Careers  in Chemistry  on the next page. Then perform  an investigation
to determine  the percentage  yield of a reaction  on page 266.

Chemical  Engineer
Chemical  engineers  are sometimes  described
as “universal  engineers”  because  of their unique
knowledge  of math, physics,  engineering,  and
chemistry.  This broad knowledge  allows  them
to work in a variety  of areas, from designing
paint factories  to developing  better  tasting,  more
nutritious  foods. Canadian  chemical  engineers
are helping  to lead the world in making  cheap,
long-lasting,  and high-quality  CDs and DVDs.
In addition  to designing  and operating  commer-
cial plants,  chemical  engineers  can be found
in university  labs, government  agencies,  and
consulting  firms.
Producing  More for Less
Once chemists  have developed  a product  in a lab-
oratory,  it is up to chemical  engineers  to design
a process  to make the product  in commercial
quantities  as efficiently  as possible.  “Scaling  up”
production  is not just a matter  of using larger
beakers.  Chemical  engineers  break down the
chemical  process  into a series of smaller  “unit
operations”  or processes  and techniques.
They use physics,  chemistry,  and complex
Percentage  Puritymathematical  models.  For example,  making  liquid
pharmaceutical  products  (such as syrups,  solu-
tions, and suspensions)  on a large scale involves
adding  specific  amounts  of raw materials  to large
mixing  tanks. Then the raw materials  are heated
to a set temperature  and mixed at a set speed
for a given amount  of time. The final product  is
filtered  and stored in holding  tanks. Chemical
engineers  ensure  that each process  produces
the maximum  amount  of product.
Becoming  a Chemical  Engineer
To become  a chemical  engineer,  you need a
bachelor’s  degree  in chemical  engineering.  Most
provinces  also require  a Professional  Engineer
(P. Eng.) designation.  Professional  engineers
must have at least four years of experience  and
must pass an examination.  As well, they must
commit  to continuing  their education  to keep up
with current  developments.  Chemical  engineers
must be able to work well with people  and to
communicate  well.
Make Career  Connections
1. Discuss  engineering  studies  and careers  with
working  engineers,  professors,  and engineer-
ing students.  Look for summer  internship
programs  and job shadowing  opportunities.
Browse  the Internet.  Contact  your provincial
engineering  association,  engineering  societies,
and universities  for more information.
2. Participate  in National  Engineering  Week in
Canada  in March of each year. This is when
postsecondary  institutions,  companies,  science
centres,  and other organizations  hold special
events,  including  engineering  contests  and
workshops.
Often impure  reactants  are the cause of a percentage  yield of less than
100%. Impurities  cause the mass data to be incorrect.  For example,  sup-
pose that you have 1.00 g of sodium  chloride  and you want to carry out a
reaction  with it. You think that the sodium  chloride  may have absorbed
some water, so you do not know exactly  how much pure sodium  chloride
you have. If you calculate  a theoretical  yield for your reaction  based on
1.00 g of sodium  chloride,  your actual yield will be less. There is not
1.00 g of sodium  chloride  in the sample.

itt in the mining  industry,  metals  are usually
FROM PAGE 265 | recovered  in the form of an ore. An ore is a
naturally  occurring  rock that contains  a high
concentration  of one or more metals.  Whether  an ore can be
profitably  mined  depends  on several  factors:  the cost of
mining  and refining  the ore, the price of the extracted  metal,
and the cost of any legal and environmental  issues related  to
land use. The inaccurate  chemical  analysis  of an ore sample
can cost investors  millions  of dollars  if the ore deposit  does
not yield what was expected.
The percentage  purity  of a sample  describes  what
proportion,  by mass, of the sample  is composed  of a specific
compound  or element.  For example,  suppose  that a sample
of gold has a percentage  purity  of 98%. This means  that
every 100 g of the sample  contains  98 g of gold and 2 g of
impurities.
You can apply your knowledge  of stoichiometry  and
percentage  yield to solve problems  related  to percentage
purity.

Iron pyrite,  FeS2, is known  as “fool’s  gold” because  it looks similar
to gold. Suppose  that you have a 13.9 g sample  of impure  iron pyrite.
(The sample  contains  a non-reactive  impurity.)  You heat the sample
in air to produce  iron(II)  oxide, Fe.03, and sulfur dioxide,  SO;.
4FeSa(s)  + 1102¢@) > 2Fe203(s)  + BSO xe)
If you obtain 8.02 g of iron(II)  oxide, what was the percentage  of
iron pyrite in the original  sample?  Assume  that the reaction  proceeds
to completion.  That is, all the available  iron pyrite reacts completely.
What Is Required?
You need to determine  the percentage  purity of the iron pyrite sample.
What Is Given?
The mass of Fe2O3 is 8.02 g. The reaction  proceeds  to completion.
You can assume  that sufficient  oxygen  is present.
Plan Your Strategy
Steps 1-4 Use your stoichiometry  problem-solving  skills to find the
mass of Fe2S expected  to have produced  8.02 g Fe2O3.

Therefore,  the percentage  purity of the iron pyrite is 86.3%.
Check  Your Solution
The units are correct.  The molar  mass of iron pyrite is 3/4 the
molar mass of iron(II)  oxide. Mutiplying  this ratio by the mole
ratio of iron pyrite to iron(II)  oxide (4/2) and 8 g gives 12 g. The
answer  is reasonable.

Section  Wrap-up
In this section,  you have learned  how the amount  of products  formed
by experiment  relates to the theoretical  yield predicted  by stoichiometry.
You have learned  about many factors  that affect actual yield, including  the
nature of the reaction,  experimental  design  and execution,  and the purity
of the reactants.  Usually,  when you are performing  an experiment  in a
laboratory,  you want to maximize  your percentage  yield. To do this, you
need to be careful  not to contaminate  your reactants  or lose any products.
Either  might affect your actual yield.

Background
Analytical  chemists  are employed  in industrial
research,  academic  research,  and forensic  sci-
ence. Their job usually  involves  two different
types of work: qualitative  analysis  and quantita-
tive analysis.  A qualitative  analysis  determines
which  substances  are present.  A quantitative
analysis  determines  how much of a specific
substance  is present.
Many other chemists  also need to use the
principles  of analytical  chemistry.  An environ-
mental  chemist,  for example,  tests water or soil
for the presence  and amounts  of impurities.  In
this investigation,  you will design  a procedure

K cepine fish as pets seems like a
simple  and straightforward  task. You
start off with a suitable  fish tank,
some water, and some fish. Once
you have added a few water-plants
for decoration,  all you have to do is
feed the fish daily. It sounds  simple.
In fact, providing  a safe, life-
sustaining  environment  for fish
involves  a variety  of complex,
interdependent  factors.  Many of
these are directly  related  to chem-
istry. For example,  the presence  of
ammonia,  NHs3, is one of the most
common  causes of death in poorly
maintained  fish tanks. Ammonia  is
produced  when uneaten  fish food
decays.  This compound  dissolves
readily  in water. It is toxic to fish
in even minute  concentrations.
Chlorine  is another  chemical
that can harm fish when it is
dissolved  in the tank water.
Unfortunately,  almost  all tap water
is treated  with chlorine.  Other factors
that affect the quality  of water for
fish include  its acidity  (pH), its
hardness,  and its temperature.  For
example,  warm water contains  too
little dissolved  oxygen.  This will
cause the fish to suffocate.
Water quality  is essential  to
every living thing. In this unit, you
will find out more about water qual-
ity. You will learn to identify  impor-
tant solutions  in your life, and how
to calculate  their concentrations.
You will also investigate  what can
happen  when acids and bases inter-
act with water and with each other.
Solutions  and
Their Concentrations
You: environment  is made up of many important  solutions, or
homogeneous  mixtures.  The air you breathe  and the liquids  you drink are
solutions.  So are many of the metallic  objects  that you use every day. The
quality  of a solution,  such as tap water, depends  on the substances  that
are dissolved  in it. “Clean”  water may contain  small amounts  of dissolved
substances,  such as iron and chlorine.  “Dirty”  water may have dangerous
chemicals  dissolved  in it.
The difference  between  clean water and undrinkable  water often
depends  on concentration:  the amount  of a dissolved  substance  in a
particular  quantity  of a solution.  For example,  tap water contains  a low
concentration  of fluoride  to help keep your teeth healthy.  Water with a
high concentration  of fluoride,  however,  could be harmful  to your health.
Water  is a good solvent  for many substances.  You may have noticed,
however,  that grease-stained  clothing  cannot  be cleaned  by water alone.
Grease  is one substance  that does not dissolve  in water. Why doesn’t  it
dissolve?  In this chapter,  you will find out why. You will learn how
solutions  form. You will explore  factors  that affect a substance’s  ability
to dissolve.  You will find out more about the concentration  of solutions,
and you will have a chance  to prepare  your own solutions  as well.
As water  runs

rocks, it dissolves

How can you find out what
solutes  are dissolved  ina
sample of water?  What physi-
cal properties  might be useful?
You will need answers  to these
questions  when you do your
Chemistry  Course Challenge.Types of Solutions
As stated in the chapter  opener,  a solution  is a homogeneous  mixture.  It
is uniform  throughout.  If you analyze  any two samples  of a solution,  you
will find that they contain  the same substances  in the same relative
amounts.  The simplest  solutions  contain  two substances.  Most common
solutions  contain  many substances.
A solvent  is any substance  that has other substances  dissolved  in it.
In a solution,  the substance  that is present  in the largest  amount  (whether
by volume,  mass, or number  of moles)  is usually  referred  to as the solvent.
The other substances  that are present  in the solution  are called the solutes.
Pure substances  (such as pure water, H,O) have fixed composition.
You cannot  change  the ratio of hydrogen,  H, to oxygen,  O, in water
without  producing  an entirely  new substance.  Solutions,  on the other
hand, have variable  composition.  This means  that different  ratios of
solvent  to solute are possible.  For example,  you can make a weak or a
strong solution  of sugar and water, depending  on how much sugar you
add. Figure 8.1 shows a strong solution  of tea and water on the left, and a
weak solution  of tea and water on the right. The ratio of solvent  to solute
in the strong solution  is different  from the ratio of solvent  to solute in the
weak solution.
How can a solution  have variable  composition  yet be uniform  throughout?
Whena solute dissolves  in a solvent,  no chemical  reaction  occurs.
Therefore,  the solute and solvent  can be separated  using physical
properties,  such as boiling  point or melting  point. For example,  water
and ethanol  have different  boiling  points.  Using this property,  a solution
of water and ethanol  can be separated  by the process  of distillation.  Refer
back to Chapter  1, section  1.2. What physical  properties,  besides  boiling
point, can be used to separate  the components  of solutions  and other
mixtures?
284 MHR- Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
Can you identify  the components  of some of these solutions?
A solution  can be a gas, a liquid, or a solid. Figure 8.2 shows some
examples  of solutions.  Various  combinations  of solute and solvent  states
are possible.  For example,  a gas can be dissolved  in a liquid, or a solid
can be dissolved  in another  solid. Solid, liquid,  and gaseous  solutions
are all around  you. Steel is a solid solution  of carbon  in iron. Juice is
a liquid solution  of sugar and flavouring  dissolved  in water. Air is an
example  of a gaseous  solution.  The four main components  of dry air are
nitrogen  (78%),  oxygen  (21%),  argon (0.9%),  and carbon  dioxide  (0.03%).
Table 8.1 lists some other common  solutions.

An alloy that is made of a
metal dissolved  in mercury  is
called an amalgam.  A tradition-
al dental amalgam,  used to fill
cavities  in teeth, contains  50%
mercury.  Due to concern  over
the use of mercury,  which is
toxic, dentists  now use other
materials,  such as ceramic
materials,  to fill dental cavities.
yy,You are probably  most familiar  with liquid solutions,  especially
aqueous  solutions.  An aqueous  solution  is a solution  in which  water is
the solvent.  Because  aqueous  solutions  are so important,  you will focus
on them in the next two sections  of this chapter  and again in Chapter  9.
Some liquids,  such as water and ethanol,  dissolve  readily  in each
other in any proportion.  That is, any amount  of water dissolves  in any
amount  of ethanol.  Similarly,  any amount  of ethanol  dissolves  in any
amount  of water. Liquids  such as these are said to be miscible  with
each other. Miscible  liquids  can be combined  in any proportions.  Thus,
either ethanol  or water can be considered  to be the solvent.  Liquids  that
do not readily  dissolve  in each other, such as oil and water, are said to
be immiscible.
As you know from Chapter  4, solid solutions  of metals  are called
alloys.  Adding  even small quantities  of another  element  to a metal
changes  the properties  of the metal. Technological  advances  throughout
history  have been linked  closely  to the discovery  of new alloys. For
example,  bronze  is an alloy of copper  and tin. Bronze  contains  only
about 10% tin, but it is much stronger  than copper  and more resistant  to
corrosion.  Also, bronze  can be melted  in an ordinary  fire so that castings
can be made, as shown  in Figure 8.3.
Solubility  and Saturation
The ability  of a solvent  to dissolve  a solute depends  on the forces of
attraction  between  the particles.  There is always  some attraction  between
solvent  and solute particles,  so some solute always  dissolves.  The
solubility  of a solute is the amount  of solute that dissolves  in a given
quantity  of solvent,  at a certain  temperature.  For
example,  the solubility  of sodium  chloride  in water
at 20°C is 36 g per 100 mL of water.
A saturated  solution  is formed  when no more
solute will dissolve  in a solution,  and excess solute is
present.  For example,  100 mL of a saturated  solution
of table salt (sodium  chloride,  NaCl) in water at 20°C
contains  36 g of sodium  chloride.  The solution  is
saturated  with respect  to sodium  chloride.  If more
sodium  chloride  is added  to the solution,  it will not
dissolve.  The solution  may still be able to dissolve
other solutes,  however.
An unsaturated  solution  is a solution  that is not
yet saturated.  Therefore,  it can dissolve  more solute.
For example,  a solution  that contains  20 g of sodium
chloride  dissolved  in 100 mL of water at 20°C is unsat-
urated.  This solution  has the potential  to dissolve
another  16 g of salt, as Figure 8.4 demonstrates.
The introduction  of the alloy bronze  around  3000 BcE
led to the production  of better-quality  tools and weapons.
286 = MHR-= Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
At 20°C, the solubility  of table salt in water
is 36 g/100 mL.
A 20 g of NaCl dissolve  to form an unsaturated  solution.
B 36 g of NaCl dissolve  to form a saturated  solution.
C 40 g of NaCl are added to 100 mL of water. 36 g
dissolve  to form a saturated  solution.  4 g of
undissolved  solute are left.
Suppose  that a solute is described  as soluble  in a particular  solvent.

described  as soluble  in water. Oxygen  from the air dissolves  in the water
of lakes and rivers. The solubility  of oxygen  in fresh water at 20°C is only
9 mg/L, or 0.0009  g/100 mL. This small amount  of oxygen  is enough  to
ensure  the survival  of aquatic  plants and animals.  A solid solute with the
same solubility,  however,  would  be described  as insoluble  in water.

Dissolving  and Solubility
As you learned  in section  8.1, the solubility  of a solute is the amount  of
solute that dissolves  in a given volume  of solvent  at a certain  temperature.
Solubility  is determined  by the intermolecular  attractions  between  solvent
and solute particles.  You will learn more about solubility  and the factors
that affect it later in this section.  First, however,  you will look at an
important  property  of a solution:  the rate of dissolving,  or how quickly  a
solute dissolves  in a solvent.
The rate of dissolving  depends  on several  factors,  including  tempera-
ture, agitation,  and particle  size. You have probably  used these factors
yourself  when making  solutions  like the fruit juice shown  in Figure 8.5.
Fruit juice is soluble  in water. The concentrated  juice in this photograph,
however,  will take a long time to dissolve.  Why?
Factors  That Affect  the Rate of Dissolving
You may have observed  that a solute, such as sugar, dissolves  faster in
hot water than in cold water. In fact, for most solid solutes,  the rate of
dissolving  is greater  at higher  temperatures.  At higher  temperatures,  the
solvent  molecules  have greater  kinetic  energy.  Thus, they collide  with the
undissolved  solid molecules  more frequently.  This increases  their rate of
dissolving.
Suppose  that you are dissolving  a spoonful  of sugar in a cup of hot
coffee. How can you make the sugar dissolve  even faster?  You can stir
the coffee.  Agitating  a mixture  by stirring  or by shaking  the container
increases  the rate of dissolving.  Agitation  brings fresh solvent  into contact
with undissolved  solid.
Finally,  you may have noticed  that a large lump of solid sugar
dissolves  more slowly  than an equal mass of powdered  sugar. Decreasing
the size of the particles  increases  the rate of dissolving.  When you break
up a large mass into many smaller  masses,  you increase  the surface  area
that is in contact  with the solvent.  This allows  the solid to dissolve  faster.
Figure 8.6 shows one way to increase  the rate of dissolving.
290 MHR-= Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
Solubility  and Particle  Attractions
By now, you are probably  very familiar  with the process  of dissolving.
You already  know what it looks like when  a solid dissolves  in a liquid.
Why, however,  does something  dissolve?  What is happening  at the
molecular  level?
The reasons  why a solute may or may not dissolve  in a solvent  are
related  to the forces of attraction  between  the solute and solvent  particles.
These forces include  the attractions  between  two solute particles,  the
attractions  between  two solvent  particles,  and the attractions  between  a
solute particle  and a solvent  particle.  When the forces of attraction
between  different  particles  in a mixture  are stronger  than the forces of
attraction  between  like particles  in the mixture,  a solution  forms. The
strength  of each attraction  influences  the solubility,  or the amount  of a
solute that dissolves  in a solvent.
To make this easier  to understand,  consider  the following  three steps
in the process  of dissolving  a solid in a liquid.
The Process  of Dissolving  at the Molecular  Level
Step1 The forces between  the particles  in the solid must be broken.
This step always  requires  energy.  In an ionic solid, the forces
that are holding  the ions together  must be broken.  In a molecu-
lar solid, the forces between  the molecules  must be broken.
Step2 Some of the intermolecular  forces between  the particles  in the
liquid must be broken.  This step also requires  energy.
Step3 There is an attraction  between  the particles  of the solid and the
particles  of the liquid. This step always  gives off energy.
The solid is more likely to dissolve  in the liquid if the energy  change  in
step 3 is greater  than the sum of the energy  changes  in steps 1 and 2.
(You will learn more about energy  and dissolving  in Unit 5.)
Polar and Non-Polar  Substances
In the Thought  Lab in section  8.1, you observed  that solid iodine is
insoluble  in water. Only a weak attraction  exists between  the non-polar
iodine  molecules  and the polar water molecules.  On the other hand, the
intermolecular  forces between  the water molecules  are very strong.  As a
result, the water molecules  remain  attracted  to each other rather than
attracting  the iodine  molecules.
You also observed  that iodine is soluble  in kerosene.  Both iodine
and kerosene  are non-polar  substances.  The attraction  that iodine  and
kerosene  molecules  have for each other is greater  than the attraction
between  the iodine  molecules  in the solid and the attraction  between  the
kerosene  molecules  in the liquid.
The Concept  Organizer  shown  on the next page summarizes  the
behaviour  of polar and non-polar  substances  in solutions.  You will learn
more about polar and non-polar  substances  later in this section.eata LINK

Solubility  and Intermolecular  Forces
You have learned  that solubility  depends  on the forces between  particles.
Thus, polar substances  dissolve  in polar solvents,  and non-polar
substances  dissolve  in non-polar  solvents.  What are these forces that act
between  particles?
In Chapter  3, section  3.3, you learned  that a water molecule  is polar.
It has a relatively  large negative  charge on the oxygen  atom, and positive
charges  on both hydrogen  atoms. Molecules  such as water, which  have
charges  separated  into positive  and negative  regions,  are said to have a
permanent  dipole.  A dipole consists  of two opposite  charges  that are sepa-

5°
The attraction  between  the opposite  charges  on two different  polar mole-
cules is called a dipole-dipole  attraction.  Dipole-dipole  attractions  are
intermolecular.  This means  that they act between  molecules.  Usually  they
are only about 1% as strong as an ionic or covalent  bond. In water, there
is a special  dipole-dipole  attraction  called  hydrogen  bonding.  It occurs
between  the oxygen  atom on one molecule  and the hydrogen  atoms on a
nearby  molecule.  Hydrogen  bonding  is much stronger  than an ordinary
dipole-dipole  attraction.  It is much weaker,  however,  than the covalent
bond between  the oxygen  and hydrogen  atoms in a water molecule.

lon-Dipole  Attractions
Ionic crystals  consist  of repeating  patterns  of oppositely  charged  ions, as
shown  in Figure 8.9. What happens  when an ionic compound  comes in
contact  with water? The negative  end of the dipole on some water mole-
cules attracts  the cations  on the surface  of the ionic crystal.  At the same
time, the positive  end of the water dipole attracts  the anions.  These attrac-
tions are known  as ion-dipole  attractions:  attractive  forces between  an ion
and a polar molecule.  If ion-dipole  attractions  can replace  the ionic bonds
between  the cations  and anions  in an ionic compound,  the compound
will dissolve.  Generally  an ionic compound  will dissolve  in a polar
solvent.  For example,  table salt (sodium  chloride,  NaCl) is an ionic
compound.  It dissolves  well in water, which  is a polar solvent.
When ions are present  in an aqueous  solution,  each ion is hydrated.
This means  that it is surrounded  by water molecules.  Hydrated  ions can
move through  a solution  and conduct  electricity.  A solute that forms an lonic crystals  have

electrolyte.  Figure 8.10 shows hydrated  sodium  chloride  ions, which
are electrolytes.Nat
ace:  lon-dipole  attrac-
tions help to explain  why sodium
chloride  dissolves  in water.
An Exception:  Insoluble  lonic Compounds
Although  most ionic compounds  are soluble  in water, some are not very
soluble  at all. The attraction  between  ions is difficult  to break. As a result,
compounds  with very strong ionic bonds,  such as silver chloride,  tend to
be less soluble  in water than compounds  with weak ionic bonds,  such as
sodium  chloride.
Predicting  Solubility
You can predict  the solubility  of a binary  compound,  such as mercury(ID)
sulfide,  HgS, by comparing  the electronegativity  of each element  in the
compound.  If there is a large difference  in the two electronegativities,  the
bond between  the elements  is polar or even ionic. This type of compound
probably  dissolves  in water. If there is only a small difference  in the two
electronegativities,  the bond is not polar or ionic. This type of compound
probably  does not dissolve  in water. For example,  the electronegativity  of
mercury  is 1.9. The electronegativity  of sulfur is 2.5. The difference  in
these two electronegativities  is small, only 0.6. Therefore,  you can predict
that mercury(II)  sulfide  is insoluble  in water. In Chapter  9, you will learn
another  way to predict  the solubility  of ionic compounds  in water.

The negative  charges  on water

with a sucrose  molecule,  as
shown by the dotted lines.The Solubility  of Covalent  Compounds
Many covalent  compounds  do not have negative  and positive  charges  to
attract  water molecules.  Thus they are not soluble  in water. There are
some exceptions,  however.  Methanol  (a component  of windshield  washer
fluid), ethanol  (the “alcohol”  in alcoholic  beverages),  and sugars (such as
sucrose)  are examples  of covalent  compounds  that are extremely  soluble
in water. These compounds  dissolve  because  their molecules  contain
polar bonds,  which  are able to form hydrogen  bonds with water.
For example,  sucrose  molecules  have a number  of sites that can
form a hydrogen  bond with water to replace  the attraction  between  the
sucrose  molecules.  (See Figure 8.11.) The sucrose  molecules  separate  and
become  hydrated,  just like dissolved  ions. The molecules  remain  neutral,
however.  As a result, sucrose  and other soluble  covalent  compounds  do
not conduct  electricity  when dissolved  in water. They are non-electrolytes.

Insoluble  Covalent  Compounds
The covalent  compounds  that are found in oil and grease are insoluble
in water. They have no ions or highly  polar bonds,  so they cannot  form
hydrogen  bonds  with water molecules.  Non-polar  compounds  tend to be
soluble  in non-polar  solvents,  such as benzene  or kerosene.  The forces
between  the solute molecules  are replaced  by the forces between  the
solute and solvent  molecules.
In general,  ionic solutes  and polar covalent  solutes  both dissolve  in
polar solvents.  Non-polar  solutes  dissolve  in non-polar  solvents.  The
phrase  like dissolves  like summarizes  these observations.  It means  that
solutes  and solvents  that have similar  properties  form solutions.
If a compound  has both polar and non-polar  components,  it may
dissolve  in both polar and non-polar  solvents.  For example,  acetic acid,
CH;COOH,  is a liquid that forms hydrogen  bonds with water. It is fully
miscible  with water. Acetic acid also dissolves  in non-polar  solvents,
such as benzene  and carbon  tetrachloride,  because  the CH; component
is non-polar.
294 MHR- Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
Factors  That Affect  Solubility
You have taken  a close look at the attractive  forces between  solute and
solvent  particles. Now that you understand  why solutes  dissolve,  it is
time to examine  the three factors  that affect solubility:  molecule  size,
temperature,  and pressure.  Notice  that these three factors  are similar  to
the factors  that affect the rate of dissolving.  Be careful  not to confuse  them.
Molecule  Size and Solubility
Small molecules  are often more soluble  than larger molecules.  Methanol,
CH;0OH,  and ethanol,  CH3;CH,OH,  are both completely  miscible  with
water. These compounds  have OH groups  that form hydrogen  bonds with
water. Larger  molecules  with the same OH group but more carbon  atoms,
such as pentanol,  CH;CH,CH,CH.CH,0OH,  are far less soluble.  All three
compounds  form hydrogen  bonds with water, but the larger pentanol
is less polar overall,  making  it less soluble.  Table 8.2 compares  five
molecules  by size and solubility.

Temperature  and Solubility
At the beginning  of this section,  you learned  that temperature  affects
the rate of dissolving.  Temperature  also affects solubility.  You may have
noticed  that solubility  data always  include  temperature.  The solubility
of a solute in water, for example,  is usually  given as the number  of grams
of solute that dissolve  in 100 mL of water at a specific  temperature.  (See
Table 8.2 for two examples.)  Specifying  temperature  is essential,  since the
solubility  of a substance  is very different  at different  temperatures.
Whena solid dissolves  in a liquid, energy  is needed  to break the
strong  bonds between  particles  in the solid. At higher  temperatures,  more
energy  is present.  Thus, the solubility  of most solids increases  with tem-
perature.  For example,  caffeine’s  solubility  in water is only 2.2 g/100 mL
at 25°C. At 100°C, however,  caffeine’s  solubility  increases  to 40 g/100 mL.
The bonds between  particles  in a liquid are not as strong as the bonds
between  particles  in a solid. When  a liquid dissolves  in a liquid, addition-
al energy  is not needed.  Thus, the solubility  of most liquids  is not greatly
affected  by temperature.
Gas particles  move quickly  and have  a great deal of kinetic  energy.
When  a gas dissolves  in a liquid,  it loses some of this energy.  At higher
temperatures,  the dissolved  gas gains energy  again. As a result, the gas
comes out of solution  and is less soluble.  Thus, the solubility  of gases
decreases  with higher  temperatures.
In the next investigation,  you will observe  and graph the effect
of temperature  on the solubility  of a solid dissolved  in a liquid solvent,
water. As you have learned,  most solid solutes  become  more soluble  at
higher  temperatures.  By determining  the solubility  of a solute at various
temperatures,  you can make  a graph of solubility  against  temperature.  The
curve of best fit, drawn  through  the points,  is called  the solubility  curve.
You can use a solubility  curve to determine  the solubility  of a solute at
any temperature  in the range shown  on the graph.=

Heat Pollution:  A Solubility  Problem
For most solids, and almost  all ionic substances,  solubility  increases  as
the temperature  of the solution  increases.  Gases, on the other hand,
always  become  Jess soluble  as the temperature  increases.  This is why a
refrigerated  soft drink tastes fizzier  than the same drink at room tempera-
ture. The warmer  drink contains  less dissolved  carbon  dioxide  than the
cooler drink.
This property  of gases makes heat pollution  a serious  problem.  Many
industries  and power  plants use water to cool down overheated  machin-
ery. The resulting  hot water is then returned  to local rivers or lakes.
Figure 8.12 shows steam rising from a “heat-polluted”  river. Adding
warm water into a river or lake does not seem like actual pollution.  The
heat from the water, however,  increases  the temperature  of the body of
water. As the temperature  increases,  the dissolved  oxygen  in the water
» decreases.  Fish and other aquatic  wildlife  and plants may not have
enough  oxygen  to breathe.
The natural  heating  of water in rivers and lakes can pose problems,
too. Fish in warmer  lakes and rivers are particularly  vulnerable  in the
summer.  When  the water warms  up even further,  the amount  of dissolved
oxygen  decreases.ati  e-mes This image  shows
the result of heat pollution.
Warmer  water contains  less
dissolved  oxygen.

Pressure  and Solubility
The final factor that affects solubility  is pressure.  Changes  in pressure
have hardly  any effect on solid and liquid solutions.  Such changes  do
affect the solubility  of a gas in a liquid solvent,  however.  The solubility  of
the gas is directly  proportional  to the pressure  of the gas above the liquid.
For example,  the solubility  of oxygen  in lake water depends  on the air
pressure  above the lake.
When you open a carbonated  drink, you can observe  the effect of pres-
sure on solubility.  Figure 8.13 shows this effect. Inside a soft drink bottle,
the pressure  of the carbon  dioxide  gas is very high: about 400 kPa. When
you open the bottle, you hear the sound of escaping  gas as the pressure  is
reduced.  Carbon  dioxide  gas escapes  quickly  from the bottle, since the
pressure  of the carbon  dioxide  in the atmosphere  is much lower: only
about 0.03 kPa. The solubility  of the carbon  dioxide  in the liquid soft
drink decreases  greatly.  Bubbles  begin to rise in the liquid as gas comes
out of solution  and escapes.  It takes a while for all the gas to leave the
solution,  so you have time to enjoy the taste of the soft drink before it
goes “flat.”
Figure  8.14 illustrates  another  example  of dissolved  gases and
pressure.  As a scuba diver goes deeper  underwater,  the water pressure
increases.  The solubility  of nitrogen  gas, which  is present  in the lungs,
also increases.  Nitrogen  gas dissolves  in the diver’s  blood. As the diver
returns  to the surface,  the pressure  acting on the diver decreases.  The
nitrogen  gas in the blood comes out of solution.  If the diver surfaces  too
quickly,  the effect is similar  to opening  a soft drink bottle. Bubbles  of
nitrogen  gas form in the blood. This leads to a painful  and sometimes
fatal condition  known  as “the bends.”  You will learn more about gases
and deep-sea  diving in Chapter  11.
5a

A
Scuba divers must heed the effects  of decreasing  water pressure  on
dissolved  nitrogen  gas in their blood. They must surface  slowly  to avoid “the bends.”What happens
when the pressure  of the carbon
dioxide  gas in a soft drink bottle
is released?  The solubility  of the
gas in the soft drink solution
decreases.
Do you crack your knuckles?
The sound you hear is
another  example  of the effect
of pressure  on solubility.  Joints
contain  fluid. When  a joint is
suddenly  pulled or stretched,
the cavity  that holds the fluid
gets larger. This causes  the
pressure  to decrease.  A
bubble of gas forms, making
the sound you hear. You cannot
repeatedly  crack your knuckles
because  it takes some time for
the gas to re-dissolve.

Chemistry  Bulletin
The story of coffee starts with the coffee berry.
First the pulp of the berry is removed.  This
leaves two beans, each containing  1% to 2%
caffeine.  The beans are soaked  in water and
natural  enzymes  to remove  the outer parch-
ment husk and to start a slight fermentation
process.  Once the beans have been fermented,
they are dried and roasted.  Then the coffee is
ready for grinding.  Grinding  increases  the sur-
face area of the coffee. Thus, finer grinds  make
it easier to dissolve  the coffee in hot water.
Decaffeinated  coffee satisfies  people  who
like the smell and taste of coffee but cannot
tolerate  the caffeine.  How is caffeine  removed
from coffee?
All the methods  of extracting  caffeine  take
place before the beans are roasted.  Caffeine  and
the other organic  compounds  that give coffee
its taste are mainly  non-polar.  (Caffeine  does
contain  some polar bonds,  however,  which
allows  it to dissolve  in hot water.)  Non-polar
solvents,  such as benzene  and trichloroethene,
were once used to dissolve  and remove
caffeine  from the beans. These chemicals  are
now considered  to be too hazardous.  Today
most coffee manufacturers  use water or carbon
dioxide  as solvents.
300 MHR- Unit 3 Solutions  and SolubilityIn the common  Swiss Water Process,
coffee beans are soaked  in hot water. This
dissolves  the caffeine  and the flavouring
compounds  from the beans. The liquid is
passed  through  activated  carbon  filters. The
filters retain the caffeine,  but let the flavouring
compounds  pass through.  The filtered  liquid,
now Caffeine-free,  is sprayed  back onto the
beans. The beans reabsorb  the flavouring
compounds.  Now they are ready for roasting.
Carbon  dioxide  gas is a normal  component
of air. In the carbon  dioxide  decaffeination
process,  the gas is raised to a temperature  of at
least 32°C. Then it is compressed  to a pressure
of about 7400 kPa. At this pressure,  it resem-
bles a liquid but can flow like a gas. The
carbon  dioxide  penetrates  the coffee beans
and dissolves  the caffeine.  When the pressure
returns  to normal,  the carbon  dioxide  reverts
to a gaseous  state. The caffeine  is left behind.
What happens  to the caffeine  that is
removed  by decaffeination?  Caffeine  is so
valuable  that it is worth more than the cost of
taking  it out of the beans. It is extensively  used
in the pharmaceutical  industry,  and for colas
and other soft drinks.
Making  Connections
1. As you have read, water is a polar liquid
and the soluble  fractions  of the coffee
grounds  are non-polar.  Explain,  in chemical
terms, how caffeine  and the coffee flavour
and aroma  are transferred  to hot coffee.
. Why does hot water work better in the
brewing  process  than cold water?
. In chemical  terms, explain  why fine grinds
of coffee make better coffee.
How can caffeine  form

water?
Section  Wrap-up

It is a volatile  chemical.  Inhaling  phenol  adversely  affects  the central

Coma and death have been known  to occur within  10 min after phenol  has
contacted  the skin. Also, as little as 1 g of phenol  can be fatal if swallowed.
Would  you expect  to find such a hazardous  chemical  in over-the-
counter  medications?  Check  your medicine  cabinet  at home. You may
find phenol  listed as an ingredient  in throat sprays  and in lotions  to
relieve  itching.  You may also find it used as an antiseptic  or disinfectant.
Is phenol  a hazard  or a beneficial  ingredient  in many medicines?  This
depends  entirely  on concentration:  the amount  of solute per quantity  of
solvent.  At high concentrations,  phenol  can kill. At low concentrations,
it is a safe component  of certain  medicines.
Modern  analytical  tests allow chemists  to detect  and measure  almost
any chemical  at extremely  low concentrations.  In this section,  you will
learn about various  ways that chemists  use to express  the concentration
of a solution.  As well, you will find the concentration  of a solution  by
experiment.
Concentration  as a Mass/Volume  Percent
Recall  that the solubility  of a compound  at a certain  temperature  is often
expressed  as the mass of the solute per 100 mL of solvent.  For example,
you know that the solubility  of sodium  chloride  is 36 g/100 mL of water at
room temperature.  The final volume  of the sodium  chloride  solution  may
or may not be 100 mL. It is the volume  of the solvent  that is important.
Chemists  often express  the concentration  of an unsaturated  solution
as the mass of solute dissolved  per volume  of the solution.  This is differ-
ent from solubility.  It is usually  expressed  as a percent  relationship.  A
mass/volume  percent  gives the mass of solute dissolved  in a volume  of
solution,  expressed  as a percent.  The mass/volume  percent  is also referred
to as the percent  (m/v).

solution  is numerically  equal to the mass/volume  percent.  Explore  this
idea further  in the following  problems.
Solving  for a Mass/Volume  Percent

A pharmacist  adds 2.00 mL of distilled  water to 4.00 g of a powdered
drug. The final volume  of the solution  is 3.00 mL. What is the
concentration  of the drug in g/100 mL of solution?  What is the
percent  (m/v) of the solution?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate  the concentration  of the solution,  in grams of
solute dissolved  in 100 mL of solution.  Then you need to express
this concentration  as a mass/volume  percent.
What Is Given?
The mass of the dissolved  solute is 4.00 g. The volume
of the solution  is 3.00 mL.

Method  2
Let x represent  the mass of solute dissolved  in 100 mL of solution.
The ratio of the dissolved  solute,  x, in 100 mL of solution  must be
the same as the ratio of 4.00 g of solute dissolved  in 3.00 mL of
solution.  The concentration,  expressed  in g/100 mL, is numerically
equal to the percent  (m/v) of the solution.

A mass/mass  percent  gives the mass of a solute divided  by the mass of

as the percent  (m/m),  or the mass percent.  It is often inaccurately  referred
to as a weight  (w/w) percent,  as well. Look at your tube of toothpaste,  at
home. The percent  of sodium  fluoride  in the toothpaste  is usually  given as
a w/w percent.  This can be confusing,  since weight  (w) is not the same as
mass (m). In fact, this concentration  should  be expressed  as a mass/mass
percent.

Concentration  as a Volume/Volume  Percent
When mixing  two liquids  to form a solution,  it is easier to measure  their
volumes  than their masses.  A volume/volume  percent  gives the volume
of solute divided  by the volume  of solution,  expressed  as a percent.  The
volume/volume  percent  is also referred  to as the volume  percent  concen-

Estimating  Concentration
of an Unknown  Solution
Copper(II)  sulfate,  CuSO,,  is a soluble  salt. It is
sometimes  added  to pools and ponds to control
the growth  of fungi. Solutions  of this salt are
blue in colour.  The intensity  of the colour
increases  with increased  concentration.  In this
investigation,  you will prepare  copper(II)  sulfate
solutions  with known  concentrations.  Then you
will estimate  the concentration  of an unknown
solution  by comparing  its colour  intensity  with
the colour  intensities  of the known  solutions.
Copper(II)  sulfate  pentahydrate  is a hydrate.
Hydrates  are ionic compounds  that have a
specific  amount  of water molecules  associated
with each ion pair.
Question
How can you estimate  the concentration  of an
unknown  solution?

1. With your partner,  develop  a method  to
prepare  100 mL of 0.500 mol/L aqueous
CuSQ,:5H20  solution.  Include  the water
molecules  that are hydrated  to the crystals,
as given in the molecular  formula,  in your
calculation  of the molar  mass. Show all your
calculations.  Prepare  the solution.
2. Save some of the solution  you prepared  in
step 1, to be tested in Part 2. Use the rest
of the solution  to make the dilutions  in
steps 3 to 5. Remember  to label the solutions.
3. Develop  a method  to dilute part of the
0.500 mol/L CuSO, solution,  to make
100 mL of 0.200 mol/L solution.  Show your
calculations.  Prepare  the solution.
4. Show your calculations  to prepare  100 mL of
0.100 mol/L solution,  using the solution  you
prepared  in step 3. (You do not need to
describe  the method  because  it will be similar
to the method  you developed  in step 3. Only
the volume  diluted  will be different.)  Prepare
the solution.
5. Repeat  step 4 to make 100 mL of 0.050 mol/L
CuSO,,  by diluting  part of the 0.100 mol/L
solution  you made. Then make 50 mL of
0.025 mol/L solution  by diluting  part of the
0.050 mol/L solution.
Part 2 Estimating  the Concentration  of an
Unknown  Solution
Materials
paper towels
6 clean, dry, identical  test tubes
medicine  droppers
5 prepared  solutions  from Part 1
10 mL of copper(I)  sulfate,  CuSO,,  solution
with an unknown  concentration
Procedure
1.You should  have five labelled  beakers
containing  CuSO, solutions  with the
following  concentrations:  0.50 mol/L,
0.20 mol/L, 0.10 mol/L,  0.05 mol/L,  and
0.025 mol/L.  Your teacher  will give you a
sixth solution  of unknown  concentration.
Record  the letter or number  that identifies
this solution.
. Label each test tube, one for each solution.
Pour a sample  of each solution  into a test
tube. The height  of the solution  in the test
tubes should  be the same. Use a medicine
dropper  to add or take away solution  as need-
ed. (Be careful  not to add water, or a solution
of different  concentration,  to a test tube.)
. The best way to compare  colour  intensity  is
by looking  down through  the test tube. Wrap
each test tube with a paper towel to stop light
from entering  the side. Arrange  the solutions
of known  concentration  in order.
. Place the solutions  over a diffuse  light source
such as a lightbox.  Compare  the colour  of the
unknown  solution  with the colours  of the
other solutions.
. Use your observations  to estimate  the
concentration  of the unknown  solution.6. Pour the solutions  of CuSO, into a beaker
supplied  by your teacher.  Wash your hands.
Analysis
1. Describe  any possible  sources  of error for
Part 1 of this investigation.
2. What is your estimate  of the concentration  of
the unknown  solution?
Conclusion
3. Obtain  the concentration  of the unknown
solution  from your teacher.  Calculate  the
percentage  error in your estimate.
Applications
4. Use your estimated  concentration  of the
unknown  solution  to calculate  the mass of
CuSO,-5H,0  that your teacher  would  need 7
to prepare  500 mL of this solution.
5. If your school  has a spectrometer  or colori-
meter, you can measure  the absorption  of light
passing  through  the solutions.  By measuring
the absorption  of solutions  of copper(II)  sulfate
with different  concentrations,  you can draw a
graph of absorption  against  concentration.

When diluting  acid,
always  add the acid to the
water—never  the reverse.
Rubber  gloves,  a lab coat, and
safety goggles  or a face shield
protect  against  acid splashes.Diluting  Concentrated  Acids
The acids that you use in your investigations  are bought  as concentrated
standard  solutions.  Sulfuric  acid is usually  bought  as an 18 mol/L solu-
tion. Hydrochloric  acid is usually  bought  as a 12 mol/L solution.  These
acids are far too dangerous  for you to use at these concentrations.  Your
teacher  dilutes  concentrated  acids, following  a procedure  that minimizes
the hazards  involved.
Concentrated  acids should  be diluted  in a fume hood because
breathing  in the fumes causes  acid to form in air passages  and lungs.
Rubber  gloves must be used to protect  the hands.  A lab coat is needed
to protect  clothing.  Even small splashes  of a concentrated  acid will form
holes in fabric. Safety  goggles,  or even a full-face  shield,  are essential.
Mixing  a strong, concentrated  acid with water is a very exothermic
process.  A concentrated  acid is denser  than water. Therefore,  when it is
poured  into water, it sinks into the solution  and mixes with the solution.
The heat that is generated  is spread  throughout  the solution.  This is
the only safe way to mix an acid and water. If you added  water to a
concentrated  acid, the water would  float on top of the solution.  The heat
generated  at the acid-water  layer could easily  boil the solution  and splat-
ter highly  corrosive  liquid. The sudden  heat generated  at the acid-water
boundary  could crack the glassware  and lead to a very dangerous  spill.
Figure 8.24 illustrates  safety precautions  needed  to dilute a strong acid.

Aqueous  Solutions
I. 1966, a Russian scientist who was lecturing in England stunned the
scientific  community  with the report of a new discovery.  He said that a
colleague  had isolated  a new form of liquid water. Dubbed  “polywater,”
this substance  was prepared  in a laboratory  by heating  and then condens-
ing HO) in very narrow  glass capillary  tubes. Over the next seven years,
scientists  around  the world conducted  studies  and published  over 500
papers  about polywater’s  properties.  For example,  its boiling  point,
density,  and viscosity  were greater  than those of ordinary  water. Its
freezing  point was lower.
Then the popular  media  took an interest.  They turned  a simmering
scientific  curiosity  into a boiling  concern.  Polywater  apparently  had a
powerful  capacity  for hydrogen  bonding.  What if it escaped  from a
laboratory?  There were dire predictions  that polywater  would “take over”
Earth’s  water resources.  The imagined  consequences  for life on Earth
were grim.
Eventually  further  studies  revealed  that polywater  was simply  a
concentrated  solution  of silicon  (silicic  acid) and several  ionic com-
pounds  in ordinary  water. The glass tubing  was the source of these
solutes.  They had leached  into the water.
The polywater  event occurred  because  scientists  overlooked,  for
awhile,  water’s  remarkable  power  as a solvent.  In this chapter,  you will
learn how to predict  which  compounds  are soluble  in water. As well,
you will consider  how chemical  reactions  in aqueous  (water)  solutions
are useful in industry  and in protecting  the quality  of our water supplies.

About  Solubility
In Chapter  8, you examined  factors  that affect the solubility  of a com-
pound.  As well, you learned  that the terms “soluble”  and “insoluble”  are
relative,  because  no substance  is completely  insoluble  in water. “Soluble”
generally  means  that more than about 1 g of solute will dissolve  in 100
mL of water at room temperature.  “Insoluble”  means  that the solubility  is
less than 0.1 g per 100 mL. While many ionic compounds  are soluble  in
water, many others are not. Cooks, chemists,  farmers,  pharmacists,  and
gardeners  need to know which  compounds  are soluble  and which  are
insoluble.  (See Figure 9.1.)
GFETISEXE  Plant food may
come in the form of a liquid or
a powder.  Gardeners  dissolve
the plant food in water, and then
either spray or water  the plant
with the resulting  solution.
Factors  That Affect  the Solubility  of lonic Substances
Nearly  all alkali metal compounds  are soluble  in water. Sulfide  and
phosphate  compounds  are usually  insoluble.  How, then, do you account
for the fact that sodium  sulfide  and potassium  phosphate  are soluble,
while iron sulfide  and calcium  phosphate  are insoluble?  Why do some
ions form soluble  compounds,  while other ions form insoluble  compounds?
The Effect  of lon Charge  on Solubility
Compounds  of ions with small charges  tend to be soluble.  Compounds  of
ions with large charges  tend to be insoluble.  Why? Increasing  the charge
increases  the force that holds the ions
| Partly or | together.  For example,  phosphates  (com-
Soluble slightly  soluble Insoluble pounds  of PO,*-)  tend to be insoluble.  On
more than 1 g between  1 g and 0.1 g | less than the other hand, the salts of alkali metals
in 100 mL in 100 mL 0.1gin100mL| are soluble.  Alkali metal cations  have a
or or orsingle positive  charge,  so the force that
holds the ions together  is less.
J
330 MHR- Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
The Effect  of lon Size on Solubility
When an atom gives up or gains an electron,  the size of the ion that results
is different  from the size of the original  atom. In Figure 9.2A, for example,
you can see that the sodium  ion is smaller  than the sodium  atom. In
general,  the ions of metals  tend to be smaller  than their corresponding
neutral  atoms. For the ions of non-metals,  the reverse  is true. The ions of
non-metals  tend to be larger than their corresponding  neutral  atoms.
Small ions bond more closely  together  than large ions. Thus, the bond
between  small ions is stronger  than the bond between  large ions with
the same charge.  As a result, compounds  with small ions tend to be less
soluble  than compounds  with large ions. Consider  the ions of elements
from Group 17 (VIIA),  for example.  Recall,  from Chapters  2 and 3, that the
size of the ions increases  as you go down  a family  in the periodic  table.
(See Figure 9.2B.) Therefore,  you would expect  that fluoride  compounds
are less soluble  than chloride,  bromide,  and iodide compounds.  This
tends to be the case.

Making  Predictions  About  Solubility
Sulfides  (compounds  of S?-) and oxides (compounds  of 07°) are influenced
by both ion size and ion charge.  These compounds  tend to be insoluble
because  their ions have a double  charge and are relatively  small. Even so, a
few sulfides  and oxides  are soluble,  as you will discover  in Investigation  1-A.
Many interrelated  factors  affect the solubility  of substances  in water.
This makes it challenging  to predict  which  ionic substances  will dissolve
in water. By performing  experiments,  chemists  have developed  guidelines
to help them make predictions  about solubility.  In Investigation  9-A,
you will perform  your own experiments  to develop  quidelines  about
the solubility  of ionic compounds  in water. \ y,are smaller  than chloride,  bromide,  and iodide

Investigation  9g — A
The Solubility  of
Ionic Compounds
In this investigation,  you will work with  a set of
solutions.  You will chemically  combine  small
quantities,  two at a time. This will help you
determine  which combinations  react to produce
a precipitate.  A precipitate  is an insoluble  solid
that may result when two aqueous  solutions
chemically  react. The appearance  of a precipi-
tate indicates  that an insoluble  compound  is
present.  Then you will compile  your data with
the data from other groups  to develop  some
guidelines  about the solubility  of several  ionic
compounds.
Problem
How can you develop  guidelines  to help you pre-
dict the solubility  of ionic compounds  in water?

combination  of anions  and cations  will likely
be soluble  and which  combination  will likely
be insoluble.  Justify  your prediction  by briefly

Safety Precautions
e Do not contaminate  the dropper  bottles.  The
tip of a dropper  should  not make contact  with
either the plate or another  solution.  Put the cap
back on the bottle immediately  after use.
e Dispose  of solutions  as directed  by your
teacher.
e Make sure that you are working  in a well-
ventilated  area.
e If you accidentally  spill any of the solutions  on
your skin, wash the area immediately  with
plenty  of cool water.
Procedure
1. Your teacher  will give you a set of nine
solutions  to test. Each solution  includes  one
of five cations  or four anions.  Design  a table
to record  the results  of all the possible
combinations  of cations  with anions  in
your set of solutions.
2. Decide  how to use the well plate or spot plate
to test systematically  all the combinations  of
cations  with anions  in your set. If your plate
does not have enough  wells, you will need
to clean the plate before you can test all the
possible  combinations.  To clean the plate, first
discard  solutions  into the container  provided
by your teacher.  Then rinse the plate with
distilled  water, and clean the wells using a
cotton swab.
3. To test each combination  of anion and cation,
add one or two drops into your well plate or
spot plate. Then stir the mixture  using a
toothpick.  Rinse the toothpick  with running
water before each stirring.  Make sure that you
keep track of the combinations  of ions in each
well or spot.
Why is it necessary  to clean the well or spot plate as
described  in step 2?
4. Examine  each mixture  for evidence  of a
precipitate.  Place the plate on a sheet of
white or black paper. (Use whichever  colour
of paper helps you see a precipitate  best.) Any
cloudy  appearance  in the mixture  is evidence
of a precipitate.  Many precipitates  are white.
e If you can see that a precipitate  has formed,
enter “I” in your table. This indicates  that
the combination  of ions produces  an
insoluble  substance.
e If you cannot  see a precipitate,  enter “S”
to indicate  that the ion you are testing
is soluble.
5. Repeat  steps 2 to 4 for each cation solution.
6. Discard  the solutions  and precipitates  into the
container  provided  by your teacher.  Rinse the
plate with water, and clean the wells using a
cotton swab.
7. If time permits,  your teacher  may give you a
second  set of solutions  to test.
8. Add your observations  to the class data table.
Use your completed  copy of the class data
table to answer  the questions  below.
Analysis
1. Identify  any cations  that
(a) always  appear  to form soluble  compounds
(b) always  appear  to form insoluble  compounds2. Identify  any anions  that
(a) always  appear  to form soluble  compounds
(b) always  appear  to form insoluble  compounds
3. Based on your observations,  which  sulfates
are insoluble?
4. Based on your observations,  which
phosphates  are soluble?
5. Explain  why each reagent  solution  you tested
must contain  both cations  and anions.
6. Your teacher  prepared  the cation solutions
using compounds  that contain  the nitrate  ion.
For example,  the solution  marked  Ca?* was
prepared  by dissolving  Ca(NOs3)2  in water.
Why were nitrates  used to make these
solutions?
Conclusions
7. Which  group in the periodic  table most
likely forms cations  with salts that are
usually  soluble?
8. Which  group in the periodic  table most
likely forms anions  with salts that are
usually  soluble?
9. Your answers  to questions  7 and 8 represent
a preliminary  set of guidelines  for predicting
the solubility  of the compounds  you tested.
Many reference  books refer to guidelines  like
these as “solubility  rules.”  Why might “solu-
bility guidelines”  be a better term to use for
describing  solubility  patterns?
Application
10. Predict  another  combination  of an anion
and a cation (not used in this investigation)
that you would  expect  to be soluble.  Predict
another  combination  that you would  expect
to be insoluble.  Share your predictions,  and
your reasons,  with the class. Account  for any
agreement  or disagreement.

the Internet  provide  chemical
and physical  data for tens of
thousands  of compounds.  Print

Handbook  of Chemistry  and
Physics,  provide  these data
as well.Soluble  or Insoluble:  General  Solubility  Guidelines
As you have seen, nearly  all salts that contain  the ammonium  ion or an
alkali metal are soluble.  This observed  pattern  does not tell you how solu-
ble these salts are, however.  As well, it does not tell you whether  ammo-
nium chloride  is more or less soluble  than sodium  chloride.  Chemists  rely
on published  data for this information.  (See Figure 9.3.)
Many factors  affect solubility.  Thus, predicting  solubility  is neither
straightforward  nor simple.  Nevertheless,  the general  solubility  guidelines
in Table 9.1 are a useful summary  of ionic-compound  interactions  with
water. To use Table 9.1, remember  that a higher  guideline  number  always
takes precedence  over a lower guideline  number.  For example,  barium
chloride,  BaCl,, is a white crystalline  powder.  The barium  ion, Ba”, is
listed in guideline  4 as insoluble.  The chloride  ion, CI, is listed in
guideline  3 as soluble.  The higher  guideline  number  takes precedence.
Thus, you would  predict  that barium  chloride  is soluble.
You will be referring  to the general  solubility  guidelines  often in this
chapter  and in Chapter  10. They will help you identify  salts that are solu-
ble and insoluble  in aqueous  solutions.  Always  keep in mind, however,
that water is a powerful  solvent.  Even an “insoluble”  salt may dissolve
enough  to present  a serious  hazard  if it is highly  poisonous.

Section  Wrap-up
In Chapter  8, you focussed  mainly  on physical  changes  that involve
solutions.  In the first section  of this chapter,  you observed  that mixing
aqueous  solutions  of ionic compounds  may result in either a physical
change  (dissolving)  or a chemical  change  (a reaction  that forms a precipi-
tate). Chemical  changes  that involve  aqueous  solutions,  especially  ionic
reactions,  are common.  They occur in the environment,  in your body,
and in the bodies of other organisms.  In the next section,  you will look
more Closely  at reactions  that involve  aqueous  solutions.  As well, you will
learn how to represent  these reactions  using a special  kind of chemical
equation,  called an ionic equation.eae LINK

336 =MHR- Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
Reactions  in Aqueous  Solutions
When you mix two aqueous  ionic compounds  together,  there are two
possible  outcomes.  Either  the compounds  will remain  in solution  without
reacting,  or one aqueous  ionic compound  will chemically  react with the
other. How can you predict  which  outcome  will occur?  Figure 9.4 shows
what happens  when an aqueous  solution  of lead(II)  nitrate  is added  to an
aqueous  solution  of potassium  iodide.  As you can see, a yellow  solid—a
precipitate—is  forming.  This is a double  displacement  reaction.  Recall,
from Chapter  4, that a double  displacement  reaction  is a chemical  reaction
that involves  the exchange  of ions to form two new compounds.  It has the
general  equation
WX+ YZ > WZ+ YX
In a double  displacement  reaction,  the cations  exchange  anions.  In the
reaction  shown  in Figure 9.4, for example,  the lead cation  is exchanged
with the iodide anion.
You can usually  recognize  a double  displacement  reaction  by
observing  one of these possible  results:
e the formation  of a precipitate  (so that ions are removed  from solution
as an insoluble  solid)
e the formation  of a gas (so that ions are removed  from solution  in the
form of a gaseous  product)
e the formation  of water (so that H* and OH” ions are removed  from
solution  as water)
In this section,  you will examine  each of these results.  At the same time,
you will learn how to represent  a double  displacement  reaction  using a
special  kind of chemical  equation:  an ionic equation.
Lead(II)  nitrate
and potassium  iodide are clear,
colourless  aqueous  solutions.
Mixing  them causes  a double
displacement  reaction.  An
insoluble  yellow  precipitate
(lead(II)  iodide)  and a soluble
salt (potassium  nitrate)  are
produced.

a metathesis  reaction  occurs

Double  Displacement  Reactions  That Produce  a Precipitate
A double  displacement  reaction  that results  in the formation  of an insolu-
ble substance  is often called a precipitation  reaction.  Figure 9.4 is a clear
example  of a precipitation  reaction.  What if you did not have this photo-
graph, however,  and you were unable  to do an experiment?  Could  you
have predicted  that mixing  Pb(NO3)(aq)  and 2KI (aq) would  result in an
insoluble  compound?  Yes. When you are given (on paper) a pair of solu-
tions to be mixed  together,  start by thinking  about the exchange  of ions
that may occur. Then use the general  solubility  guidelines  (Table 9.1) to
predict  which  compounds,  if any, are insoluble.
For example,  consider  lead(IJ)  nitrate,  Pb(NO3)2,  and potassium
iodide,  KI. Lead(IJ)  nitrate contains  Pb*t cations  and NO; anions.
Potassium  iodide contains  K* cations  and I anions.  Exchanging  positive
ions results  in lead(II)  iodide,  Pbl2, and potassium  nitrate,  KNO3. From
the solubility  guidelines,  you know that all potassium  salts and nitrates
are soluble.  Thus, potassium  nitrate is soluble.  The Pb** ion is listed in
guideline  2 as an insoluble  cation.  The I ion is listed in guideline  3 as
a soluble  anion. Remember  that a higher  guideline  number  takes prece-
dence over a lower guideline  number.  Thus, you can predict  that lead(ID)
iodide is insoluble.  It will form a precipitate  when the solutions  are
mixed.  The balanced  chemical  equation  for this reaction  is
Pb(NO3)a(aq)  + 2KI aq) > 2KNOs3\(aq)  + PbI 4,5)
Predicting  the Formation  of a Precipitate
Problem
Which  of the following  pairs of aqueous  solutions  produce  a precipi-
tate when mixed  together?  Write the balanced  chemical  equation  if
you predict  a precipitate.  Write “NR” if you predict  that no reaction
takes place.
(a) potassium  carbonate  and copper(II)  sulfate
(b) ammonium  chloride  and zinc sulfate
What Is Required?
You need to predict  whether  or not each pair of aqueous  solutions
forms an insoluble  product  (a precipitate).  If it does, you need to
write a balanced  chemical  equation.
What Is Given?
You know the names  of the compounds  in each solution.

Start by identifying  the ions in each pair of compounds.  Then
exchange  the positive  ions in the two compounds.  Compare  the

(a) Potassium  carbonate  contains  K* and CO3*" ions. Copper(II)  sul-
fate contains  Cu2* and SO,”" ions. Exchanging  positive  ions results
in potassium  sulfate,  K2SO,4,  and copper(II)  carbonate,  CuCQ3.
All potassium  salts are soluble,  so these ions remain  dissolved
in solution.
The copper(II)  ion is listed in guideline  5 as a soluble  cation.  The
carbonate  anion is listed in guideline  2 as insoluble.  Because
guideline  2 is higher,  copper(II)  carbonate  should  be insoluble.  So
you can predict  that a precipitate  forms. The balanced  chemical
equation  for this reaction  is
KzCOs(aq)  + CuSOa(aq) > K2SOa(aq)  + CUuCO3,s)
(b) Ammonium  chloride  contains  NH,* and Cl ions. Zinc sulfate
consists  of Zn** and SO,” ions. Exchanging  positive  ions results
in ammonium  sulfate,  (NH4)2SO,,  and zinc chloride,  ZnCl.
Since all ammonium  salts are soluble,  the ammonium  sulfate
stays dissolved  in solution.
Zinc chloride  consists  of a guideline  5 soluble  cation  and a guide-
line 3 soluble  anion. Because  guideline  3 is higher,  zinc chloride
should  be soluble.  Thus, you can predict  that no precipitate  forms.

Some reactions  produce  a compound  that, afterward,  decomposes  into

It reacts with hydrochloric  acid to form sulfurous  acid. The sulfurous  acid
then breaks down into sulfur dioxide  gas and water. The net reaction  is
the sum of both changes.  If the same compound  appears  on both sides of
an equation  (as sulfurous  acid, H,SO3,  does here), it can be eliminated.
This is just like eliminating  terms from an equation  in mathematics.

Representing  Aqueous  lonic Reactions  with Net lonic Equations
Mixing  a solution  that contains  silver ions with a solution  that contains
chloride  ions produces  a white precipitate  of silver chloride.  There must
have been other ions present  in each solution,  as well. You know this
because  it is impossible  to have a solution  of just a cation or just an anion.
Perhaps  the solution  that contained  silver ions was prepared  using silver
nitrate  or silver acetate.  Similarly,  the solution  that contained  chloride
ions might  have been prepared  by dissolving  NaCl in water, or perhaps
NH,Cl or another  soluble  chloride.  Any solution  that contains  Ag" (aq)
will react with any other solution  that contains  Cl (aq) to form a
precipitate  of AgCl;,).  The other ions in the solutions  are not important
to the net result. These ions are like passive  onlookers.  They are called
spectator  ions.
The reaction  between  silver nitrate  and sodium  chloride  can be
represented  by the following  chemical  equation:
AgNOs(aq)  + NaCliaq)  > NaNOs(aq)  + AgCl(s)
This equation  does not show the change  that occurs,  however.  It shows
the reactants  and products  as intact compounds.  In reality,  soluble  ionic
compounds  dissociate  into their respective  ions in solution.  So chemists
often use a total ionic equation  to show the dissociated  ions of the soluble
ionic compounds.
Ag’ (aq) + NOs (aq) + Na‘ (aq) + Cl (aq) > Na‘ (aq) + NOs (aq) + AgCl(s)
Notice  that the precipitate,  AgCl, is still written  as an ionic formula.  This
makes sense because  precipitates  are insoluble,  so they do not dissociate
into ions. Also notice that the spectator  ions appear  on both sides of the
equation.  Here is the total ionic equation  again, with slashes  through  the
spectator  ions.
Ag" (aq) + NO¥{aq)  + Naa  + Cl (aq) > Na*tq)  + NO¥faq)  + AgClis)
If you eliminate  the spectator  ions, the equation  becomes
Ag’ (aq) + Cl (aq) > AgClis)
Chapter 9 Aqueous  Solutions  * MHR 341
An ionic equation  that is written  this way, without  the spectator  ions, is
called a net ionic equation.  Before  you try writing  your own net ionic
equations,  examine  the guidelines  in Table 9.2 below.
Table 9.2 Guidelines  for Writing a Net lonic Equation
1. Include  only ions and compounds  that have reacted.  Do not include
spectator  ions.
2. Write the soluble  ionic compounds  as ions. For example,  write
NH4*(aq)  and Cl  (aq), instead  of NH4Cltaq).
3. Write insoluble  ionic compounds  as formulas,  not ions. For example,
zinc sulfide  is insoluble,  so you write it as ZnS;,), not Zn?* and S*.
4. Since covalent  compounds  do not produce  ions in aqueous  solution,
write their molecular  formulas.  Water is a common  example,
because  it dissociates  only very slightly  into ions. When  a reaction
involves  a gas, always  include  the gas in the net ionic equation.
5. Write strong acids (discussed  in the next chapter)  in their ionic
form. There are six strong acids:
e hydrochloric  acid (write as H*(aq) and Cl (aq), not HClaq))
e hydrobromic  acid (write as H'(aq) and Br(aq))
e hydroiodic  acid (write as H*(aq) and [ (aq)
e sulfuric  acid (write as H*(aq) and SOa(aq))
e nitric acid (write as H'(aq) and NO3 (aq))
e perchloric  acid (write as H*(aq) and C1O4 (aq))
All other acids are weak and form few ions. Therefore,  write them
in their molecular  form.
6. Finally,  check that the net ionic equation  is balanced  for charges  as
well as for atoms.

Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Start by writing  the chemical  formulas  of the given
compounds.
Step2 Then write the complete  chemical  equation  for the reaction,
using your experience  in predicting  the formation  of a
precipitate.
Step 3 Once you have the chemical  equation,  you can replace  the
chemical  formulas  of the soluble  ionic compounds  with their
dissociated  ions.
Step 4 This will give you the total ionic equation.  Next you can
identify  the spectator  ions (the ions that appear  on both sides
of the equation).
Step5 Finally,  by rewriting  the total ionic equation  without  the
spectator  ions, you will have the net ionic equation.
Act on Your Strategy
Steps1 and 2 The chemical  equation  for the reaction  is
NagS (aq) + FeSOa(aq)  > NazSOa(aq)  + FeSis)
Step3 The total ionic equation  is
2Na(aq)  + S* (aq) + Fe** (aq) + SQZ (aq) > 2Na" (aq) +SO7"  (aq) + FeSis)
Step 4 Therefore,  the spectator  ions are Na‘ (aq) and SOq” (aq).
Step5 The net ionic equation  is
Fe** (aq) + S* (aq) — FeS\s)
Check  Your Solution
Take a final look at your net ionic equation  to make sure that no ions
are on both sides of the equation.

Identifying  lons in Aqueous  Solution
Suppose  that you have a sample  of water. You want to know what, if any,
ions are dissolved  in it. Today  technological  devices,  such as the mass
spectrometer,  make this investigative  work fairly simple.  Before such
devices,  however,  chemists  relied on wet chemical  techniques:
experimental  tests, such as submitting  a sample  to a series of double
displacement  reactions.  Chemists  still use wet chemical  techniques.
With each reaction,  insoluble  compounds  precipitate  out of the solution.
(See Figure 9.6.) This enables  the chemist  to determine,  eventually,  the
identity  of one or several  ions in the solution.  This ion-identification
process  is an example  of qualitative  analysis.
Chemists  use a range of techniques  for qualitative  analysis.  For exam-
ple, the colour  of an aqueous  solution  can help to identify  one of the ions
that it contains.  Examine  Table 9.3. However,  the intensity  of ion colour
varies with its concentration  in the solution.  Also keep in mind that many
ions are colourless  in aqueous  solution.  For example,  the cations  of ele-
ments from Groups  1 (IA) and 2 (IIA), as well as aluminum,  zinc, and
most anions,  are colourless.  So there are limits to the inferences  you can
make if you rely on solution  colour  alone.
Another  qualitative  analysis  technique  is a flame test. A dissolved
ionic compound  is placed  in a flame. Table 9.4 lists the flame colours
associated  with several  ions. Notice  that all the ions are metallic.  The
flame test is only useful for identifying  metallic  ions in aqueous  solution.
Qualitative  analysis  challenges  a chemist’s  creative  imagination  and
chemical  understanding.  Discover  this for yourself  in Investigation  9-B.

Limiting  Reactant  Problems  in Aqueous  Solutions
In Chapter  7, you learned  how to solve limiting  reactant  problems.  You
can always  recognize  a limiting  reactant  problem  because  you are always
given the amounts  of both reactants.  A key step in a limiting  reactant
problem  is determining  which one of the two reactants  is limiting.  In

Drinking  water guidelines
exist for microscopic  organ-
isms, such as bacteria  and
protozoans,  as well as for
chemicals.  These guidelines
were compromised  in the town
of Walkerton,  Ontario,  in 2000.
Seven people died and about
2000 people became  ill as a
result of exposure  to F. coli
bacteria  that were present  in
the town’s  water supply.  The
maximum  acceptable  concen-
tration  for EF. coli bacteria  is
zero organisms  detectable  in
100 mL of drinking  water. To
achieve  this target, chlorine  is
commonly  used to kill E. coli
and other organisms  in drink-
ing water. Despite  receiving
two warnings  from the Ministry
of the Environment,  the town’s
water manager  chose not to
increase  the concentration  of
chlorine  in the water supply.
As a result of this incident,  the
Ontario government  drafted
legislation  to enforce  strict
adherence  to water quality
quidelines.
Landfill  leachate
is rainwater  that has percolated
through  landfill  wastes.  It dis-
solves numerous  compounds,
many of them toxic. Modern
landfills  have containment  and
treatment  procedures  to prevent
this diffuse  source  of pollution
from contaminating  ground  water.Sources  That Compromise  Water Quality
Pure water does not exist in nature.  All water naturally  contains  dissolved
substances  or ions. For example,  rainwater  is naturally  acidic.  This is
because  water droplets  dissolve  atmospheric  gases, such as carbon  diox-
ide, to form carbonic  acid, H,CO3.  As water filters through  soil and rock,
it tends to dissolve  (leach) certain  ions and compounds,  such as Ca**(aq),
Mg**(aq)»  Fe**(aq),  Fe**(aq),  and SO4” (aq). In general,  these substances  pose
little or no threat  to plants,  animals,  or you. In contrast,  many of the
substances  listed in Table 9.5 may pose a threat. They result mainly  from
human  activities,  such as manufacturing,  food and materials  processing,
farming,  and garbage  disposal.  The sources  of these substances  can be
classified  in the following  three broad categories.
e Point Sources: A manufacturing  or processing  plant that discharges
untreated  or insufficiently  treated  waste water into a river or lake is a
point source of pollution.  Point sources  include  wrecked  tankers  that
leak oil and factories  that discharge  metallic  ions, organic  compounds,
acids, and bases. Water itself can be a point source of thermal  pollution,
when thermal  power  plants discharge  warm water into a lake from their
cooling  towers.  Point sources  can spread  pollution  over huge areas.
e Diffuse  Sources:  Pollution  that comes from a wide range of sources,
not from a single source,  is said to come from a diffuse  source.  (See
Figure 9.7.) A heavy downpour  can cause run-off  from farm fields to
enter rivers and lakes. This run-off  often carries  undesirable  pollutants,
including  fecal matter,  pesticides,  and fertilizer  compounds,  such as
nitrates  and phosphates.
e Indirect  Sources:  Air, water, and soil can become  polluted  from a
variety  of indirect  sources.  Motor  vehicles  and factory  smokestacks
release  gases that can indirectly  cause many different  types of pollution.
The acidic gases that are produced  (sulfur  dioxide  and nitrogen  oxides)
dissolve  and contribute  to the formation  of acid rain. The concentra-
tions of ions in ground  water are affected  by how acidic the water is.
For example,  aluminum  compounds  are commonly  found in soil. Acidic
water increases  the leaching  of aluminum  ions into rivers and lakes.

Treating  Water  for Your Home
If you live on a farm or in a remote  area, you probably  obtain  your water
directly  from a well on your property.  If you live in an urban community,
you probably  obtain  your water through  a municipal  or regional  water
authority.  Before  the water is made available  to you, it is processed  at a
water  treatment  plant to remove  pollutants.  Lake, river, or reservoir  water
enters  the treatment  plant, where  a number  of physical  and chemical
processes  take place. Figure 9.8 summarizes  these processes.

2 Chlorine  is added to kill bacteria  and viruses. It also helps to remove dissolved  hydrogen  sulfide:
H2S(aq) + AClo(aq) + 4H20(y > 8CK (aq) + S04? (aq) + 10H * (aq)
3 A process  called flocculation  removes  suspended  particles  such as clay and microorganisms.  Lime (CaO)
and aluminum  sulfate  (Al2(SOu)3)  are added.  They react together  to form aluminum  hydroxide:
3Ca0(«)  + 3H20,) + Als(SO4)3(5)  => 2Al(OH)3(5)  + 3Ca?* (aq) + 3802 (aq)
Aluminum  hydroxide  is a sticky gel that traps the finely suspended  particles.  Lime is a basic oxide, so it
decreases  the acidity  of the water, and it precipitates  some calcium  carbonate.  The aluminum  hydroxide
with its trapped  particles  settles  to the bottom  of the tank.
a The water is passed through  a bed of graded gravel and sand in a filtering  tank.
@ Water is often saturated  with oxygen by spraying  it into the air, which helps to remove  volatile organic
compounds  and improves  the taste and odour.
® The water receives  a second  treatment  with chlorine  to kill bacteria.  Ammonia  is added to make the
chlorine  last longer  in the piping.  Some municipalities  add compounds  such as sodium  fluoride.
The following  processes  take place at a water  treatment  plant. These
processes  must ensure  that the water meets all the allowable  concentrations.

Why is hard water so hard to
lather? Ordinary  soap is often
sodium  stearate,  NaC;7H3502.
Sodium  stearate  consists  of
the sodium  salt of a compound
that contains  many carbon
atoms. The calcium  ions in
hard water displace  the
sodium  ions, and the new
salts are insoluble:
Cat aq) + 2Nali7H350  (aq) >
Ca(Ci7H3502) 1) + 2Na*(aq)
As a result, the effectiveness
of the soap is reduced.  The
insoluble  salts form a scum
on clothing  and a grey slimy
deposit  in sinks and bathtubs:
“bathtub  ring.”
\ y,Hard Water  and Soft Water
The water that flows through  your faucet  has been treated  to remove,
or limit, a large number  of pollutants.  It is far from pure, however.  For
example,  it still contains  dissolved  ions, such as Ca”*,ag),  Mg”*(aq)»  Fe?*(aq);
Fe**(aq),  and SO,” (aq). These ions, especially  calcium  and magnesium,
make it difficult  to form lather  with soap. Water  with high concentrations
of these ions is called hard water, partly  because  it is “hard”  to lather.
Water  with relatively  low concentrations  of these ions lathers  well. It is
called soft water.
Ground  water is usually  harder  than surface  water in the same region.
The extent  of the hardness  depends  on the types of rocks through  which
the water flows. It also depends  on the length  of time that the water is
in contact  with the rocks. The Rocky  Mountains,  the Canadian  Shield,
and most of the Maritimes  have very insoluble  bedrock.  Thus, the water
in these regions  is usually  soft. The sedimentary  rocks of the Niagara
Peninsula  and the Prairies  are more soluble,  resulting  in water that ranges
from moderately  hard to very hard.
The most common  type of rock to cause hard water is limestone
(calcium  carbonate).  Limestone  is usually  considered  insoluble.  The small
amount  that does dissolve  forms low concentrations  of important  ions.
CaCOs(s) + H20¢) > Ca** (aq) + HCO s(aq) + OH (aq)
When  the water contains  dissolved  acids (often H,CO; from rainwater),
the H_,,) ion increases  the concentrations  of calcium  and hydrogen
carbonate  ions.
CaCO3(s)  + Haq) —> Ca**(aq)  + HCO* (ag)
Hydrogen  carbonate  ions can be economically  costly. Solutions  that
contain  these ions decompose  when heated  to form carbonates.
2HCOs3 (aq) — HO + CO2¢) + CO3* (aq)
The carbonate  ions recombine  with calcium  ions to form calcium  carbon-
ate deposits.  These deposits  form a coating  on heating  elements  in kettles
and boilers,  and build up inside  hot water pipes. The coating  is com-
monly  called boiler scale. (See Figure 9.9.) It not only reduces  the flow
of water in pipes, but it also increases  the cost of heating  the water.
A simple  way to remove  boiler scale from the inside of a kettle or
a coffee maker  is to add vinegar.  Acetic acid in vinegar  reacts with
calcium  (and magnesium)  carbonates  to form soluble  salts. (Remember
that all acetates  are soluble.)

Treating  Water at Home
The ions that cause hard water are not a health  hazard  but they can be
a nuisance.  They are not always  removed  at municipal  treatment  plants.
If you wish, you can remove  some of these ions (mainly  Ca**(ag), Mg”* (aq);
and Fe**(aq))  yourself.  For relatively  small volumes  of water (such as
enough  to fill a bathtub  or a washing  machine),  you can add sodium
carbonate  decahydrate,  NazCO3-10H,0.  This compound  is commonly
called  washing  soda. It is an inexpensive  way to add carbonate  ion to the
water. The carbonate  ions precipitate  the unwanted  ions.
Ca**(aq) + CO3* (aq) > CaCOx(s)
The sodium  ions in the washing  soda behave  as spectator  ions, leaving
the water soft.
For the large volume  of water needed  on  a daily basis, people  often
install  an ion exchange  water softener.  This apparatus  exchanges  one
kind of ion for another.  (See Figure 9.10.) The hard water passes  through  a
column  that is packed  with beads. The beads are made from an insoluble
plastic  material  and are coated  with sodium  salts, often NaCl. (The salt-
coated  beads are referred  to as an ion exchange  resin.) As the hard water
passes  through  the column,  the ions in the water displace  the sodium
ions on the resin. After most of the sodium  ions have been exchanged  for
calcium  ions (and other hardness-causing  ions), the resin is regenerated.
This is done by passing  a very concentrated  solution  of sodium  chloride
(brine)  through  the column.  The calcium  ions are flushed  out of the
system,  along with excess sodium  chloride  solution.

Waste-Water  Treatment
The treatment  of waste water (sewage)  is often divided  into three types:
primary,  secondary,  and tertiary  treatment.  (See Figure 9.11.)
¢ Primary  treatment  mainly  involves  removing  solids from waste water
physically,  using filters and settling  tanks.
e Secondary  treatment  involves  using bacteria  to chemically  decompose
dissolved  and suspended  organic  compounds.

Dr. Jiangning  Wu:
Cleaning  the World’s  Water
Around  the world, researchers  are working  to
reduce  the pollutants  in our lakes, rivers, and
ground  water. Both industry  and agriculture  too
often produce  waste water  that contains  every-
thing from animal  droppings  and excess  fertilizer
to artificial  colours  and other chemicals.  Yet,
without  industry  and agriculture,  we would not
have many of the modern  comforts  we expect
and enjoy.
Jiangning  Wu was born and raised in
Nanjing,  China. She came to Canada  to complete
her studies  in chemical  engineering  at the
University  of Windsor.  After earning  her doctorate
in 1992, she turned her attention  to the use of
enzymes  for purifying  waste water.Enzymes  are naturally  occurring  substances
that speed up chemical  reactions  without  being
used up or changed  by the reactions.  They are
basic to living organisms.  Thus it is no surprise
that they are well-suited  to removing  organic
pollutants  from waste water. For instance,  an
enzyme  that is found in horseradish  helps to
accelerate  the oxidation  of soluble  organic  pollu-
tants known as phenols.  The resulting  com-
pounds  are less soluble  and more easily removed
from the waste water.
In 1993, Dr. Wu found that, with a single
additive,  the same enzyme  was able to remove
phenols  from waste  water. Her strategy  worked
even for the low concentrations  of phenols
typical  of industrial  waste water. Moreover,
significantly  lower concentrations  of the enzyme
were needed!  Dr. Wu's discovery  brought
researchers  one step closer  to a commercial
process,  which would mean cleaner  waters  and
less stress on the environment.
Dr. Wu is a professor  in the School  of
Chemical  Engineering  at Ryerson  Polytechnical
University  in Toronto.  She is currently  investigat-
ing the use of ozone for waste-water  treatment

Section  Wrap-up
In this section,  you applied  your understanding  of aqueous  solutions  to
explore  the chemistry  of water quality.  Some of the chemicals  you
considered  belong  to a group of compounds  that are called acids and
bases. In the next chapter,  you will investigate  the properties  and chemi-
cal behaviour  of these important  compounds.
Chlorine  was first used to
disinfect  water in Britain in
1904, after a typhoid epidemic.
(Typhoid  is a water-borne,  con-
tagious  illness that is caused
by a species  of Sa/monella
bacteria.)  Strict limits are
necessary  because  chlorine  is
ineffective  when its concentra-
tion is less than 0.1 mg/L. It
gives water an unpleasant
taste at concentrations  above
1.0 mg/L. Chlorine  has a disad-
vantage,  however.  It can react
with other chemicals  in the
waterto form poisonous  com-
pounds,  such as chloroform,
CHCl3. These chemicals  may
remain in solution  even after
[ the entire treatment  process.Section  Review
1) In what ways can water in the environment  become  polluted?
Give at least two examples  for each.
2 ) Which chemical  in Table 9.5 has the lowest acceptable
concentration?  Which  chemical  has the highest  acceptable  concentra-
tion? Rearrange  the chemicals  in the table so they are organized  by
concentration,  from lowest  to highest,  rather than alphabetically  by
name.

Inquiry
11. A reference  book states that the solubility  of
silver sulfate  is 0.57 g in 100 mL of cold water.
You decide  to check this by measuring  the
mass of a silver salt precipitated  from a known
volume  of saturated  silver sulfate solution.
Solubility  data show that silver chloride  is
much less soluble  than silver nitrate.  Explain
why you should  not use barium  chloride  to
precipitate  the silver ions. Suggest  a different
reagent,  and write the net ionic equation  for the
reaction.
12. The presence  of copper(II)  ions in solution
can be tested by adding  an aqueous  solution
of sodium  sulfide.  The appearance  of a black
precipitate  indicates  that the test is positive.
A solution  of copper(II)  bromide  is tested this
way. What precipitate  is formed?  Write the net
ionic equation  for the reaction.
13. An old home-gardening  “recipe”  for fertilizer
suggests  adding  15 g of Epsom  salts (magne-
sium sulfate  heptahydrate,  MgSO,-7H20)  to 4 L
of water. What will be the concentration  of
magnesium  ions?
14. Calculate  the concentration  (in mol/L) of each
aqueous  solution.
(a) 7.37 g of table sugar, Cy2H2201,  dissolved  in
125 mL of solution

18. Imagine  that you are the chemist  at a cement
factory.  You are responsible  for analyzing  the
factory’s  waste water. If a 50.0 mL sample  of

19. The concentration  of calcium  ions, Cat, in
blood plasma  is about 2.5 x 10? mol/L.
Calcium  ions are important  in muscle  contrac-
tion and in regulating  heartbeat.  If the concen-
tration  of calcium  ions falls too low, death is
inevitable.  In a television  drama,  a patient  is
brought  to hospital  after being accidentally
splashed  with hydrofluoric  acid. The acid
readily  penetrates  the skin, and the fluoride
ions combine  with the calcium  ions in the
blood. If the patient’s  volume  of blood plasma
is 2.8 L, what amount  (in mol) of fluoride
ions would completely  combine  with all the
calcium  ions in the patient’s  blood?
20. A double  displacement  reaction  occurs  in
aqueous  solution  when magnesium  phosphate
reacts with lead(II)  nitrate.  If 20.0 mL of
0.750 mol/L  magnesium  phosphate  reacts,
what is the maximum  mass of precipitate  that
can be formed?
Communication
21. Phosphate  ions act as a fertilizer.  They promote
the growth  of algae in rivers and lakes. They
can enter rivers and lakes from fields that are
improperly  fertilized  or from untreated  waste
water that contains  phosphate  detergents.
How can the water be treated  to remove  the
phosphate  ions?
22. A chemist  analyzes  the sulfate  salt of an
unknown  alkaline  earth metal. The chemist

metal cation?  What test might  the chemist
perform  to help confirm  this conclusion?
23. The same volume  of solution  is made using the
same masses  of two salts: rubidium  carbonate
and calcium  carbonate.  Which  salt gives the
larger concentration  of aqueous  carbonate  ions?
24. A prospector  asks you to analyze  a bag of silver
ore. You measure  the mass of the ore and add
excess  nitric acid to it. Then you add excess
sodium  chloride  solution.  You filter and dry
the precipitate.  The mass of the ore is 856.1 g,
and 1.092  g of silver chloride  is collected.
(a) Why did you first treat the ore with excess
nitric acid?
(b) Calculate  the mass percent  of silver in the
ore. The ore that is extracted  at a silver mine
typically  contains  about 0.085%  silver by

arm odour have in common?  They are all acidic or basic. Do you know
which  are acidic and which  are basic?
Acids and bases are very important  chemicals.  They have been used
for thousands  of years. Vinegar  is an acidic solution  that is common  in
many food and cleaning  products.  It was discovered  long ago—before 10.3 Acid-Base  Reactions
people  invented  the skill of writing  to record  its use. Today,  acids are also
used to manufacture  fertilizers,  explosives,  plastics,  motor  vehicles,  and
computer  circuit  boards.
Like acids, bases have numerous  uses in the home and in chemical
industries.  Nearly  5000 years ago, in the Middle  East, the Babylonians
made soap using the bases in wood ash. Today, one of Canada’s  most
important  industries,  the pulp and paper industry,  uses huge quantities
of a base called sodium  hydroxide.  Sodium  hydroxide  is also used to
manufacture  soaps, detergents,  dyes, and many other compounds.
In this chapter,  you will learn about the properties  of acids and bases.
You will learn how these properties  change  when acids and bases react
together.  As well, you will have a chance  to estimate  and measure  the :

The word “acid” comes  from
the Latin acidus,  meaning
“sour tasting.”  As you will
learn in this chapter,  bases
are the “base” (the foundation)
from which many other com-
pounds  form. A base that is
soluble  in water is called an
alkali. The word “alkali”  comes
from an Arabic word meaning
“ashes  of a plant.” In the
ancient  Middle East, people
rinsed plant ashes with hot
waterto obtain a basic
solution.  The basic solution
was then reacted  with animal
fats to make soap.Acid-Base  Theories
As you can see in Table 10.1, acids and bases are common  products  in the
home. It is easy to identify  some products  as acids. Often the word “acid”
appears  in the list of ingredients.  Identifying  bases is more difficult.  Acids
and bases have different  properties,  however,  that enable  you to distin-
guish between  them.

Properties  of Acids and Bases
One way to distinguish  acids from bases is to describe  their observable
properties.  For example,  acids taste sour, and they change  colour  when
mixed  with coloured  dyes called indicators.  Bases taste bitter and feel
slippery.  They also change  colour  when mixed  with indicators.
You should  never taste or touch acids, bases, or any other
chemicals.  Early chemists  used their senses  of taste and touch to
observe  the properties  of many chemicals.  This dangerous  practice
often led to serious  injury,  and sometimes  death.
Another  property  that can be used to distinguish  acids from bases is
their conductivity  in solution.  As you can see in Figure 10.1, aqueous
solutions  of acids and bases conduct  electricity.  This is evidence  that ions
are present  in acidic and basic solutions.  Some of these solutions,  such as
hydrochloric  acid and sodium  hydroxide  (a base), cause the bulb to
glow brightly.  Most acidic and basic solutions,  however,  cause the bulb
to glow dimly.

An oxide is a compound  of oxy-
gen with a metal or non-metal.
Most metal oxides react with
waterto form basic solutions.
For example,  calcium  oxide is a
metal oxide that is important  in
the construction  industry  as an
ingredient  of cement.  Calcium
oxide reacts  with water  to form
a basic solution  of calcium
hydroxide.
CaO\s) + H20(e) > Cal(OH)a(aq)
Many municipal  water  treat-
ment plants use calcium
hydroxide  to soften very hard
water before releasing  it for
public use. Most non-metal
oxides react with water to form
acidic solutions.  For example,
sulfur dioxide  gas dissolves  in
water  to form sulfurous  acid.

The metallic  character  of the
elements  in the periodic  table,
and the acid-base  properties
of their oxides,  show a distinct
trend across periods  and down
groups.  Infer what this trend is.
In other words,  state what you
think happens  to the acid-base
properties  of oxides as you go
across a period and down a
group. Make a quick sketch of
the periodic  table to illustrate
this trend. How would you
describe  the acid-base  proper-
ties of the metalloids?  (Use
your knowledge  of the physical
properties  of the metalloids  to
help you make your inference.)

The Arrhenius  Theory  of Acids and Bases
In Figure 10.1, you saw evidence  that ions are present  in solutions  of
acids and bases. When  hydrogen  chloride  dissolves  in water, for example,
it dissociates  (breaks  apart) into hydrogen  ions and chloride  ions.
HCliaq) > A" (aq) + Cl (aq)
When sodium  hydroxide  dissolves  in water, it dissociates  to form sodium

The dissociations  of other acids and bases in water reveal a pattern.  This
pattern  was first noticed  in the late nineteenth  century  by a Swedish

e An acid is a substance  that dissociates  in water  to produce  one or
more hydrogen  ions, H*.
e A base is a substance  that dissociates  in water to form one or more
hydroxide  ions, OH’.
According  to the Arrhenius  theory,  acids increase  the concentration  of H*
in aqueous  solutions.  Thus, an Arrhenius  acid must contain  hydrogen  as
the source of H*. You can see this in the dissociation  reactions  for acids
on the previous  page.
Bases, on the other hand, increase  the concentration  of OH” in aque-
ous solutions.  An Arrhenius  base must contain  the hydroxyl  group,  —OH,
as the source of OH. You can see this in the dissociation  reactions  for
bases on the previous  page.
Limitations  of the Arrhenius  Theory
The Arrhenius  theory  is useful if you are interested  in the ions that result
when an acid or a base dissociates  in water. It also helps explain  what
happens  when an acid and a base undergo  a neutralization  reaction.  In
such a reaction,  an acid combines  with a base to form an ionic compound
and water. Examine  the following  reactions:
HC]l(aq)  + NaOH aq) > NaCl(aq)  + H20ce)
The net ionic equation  for this reaction  shows the principal  ions in the
Arrhenius  theory.
A" (aq) + OH (aq) — H20,e)
Since acids and bases produce  hydrogen  ions and hydroxide  ions, water
is an inevitable  result of acid-base  reactions.
Problems  arise with the Arrhenius  theory,  however.  One problem
involves  the ion that is responsible  for acidity:  H*. Look again at the equa-
tion for the dissociation  of hydrochloric  acid.
HCliaq) —> H*(aq) + Cl (aq)
This dissociation  occurs  in aqueous  solution,  but chemists  often leave out
H,0 as a component  of the reaction.  They simply  assume  that it is there.
What happens  if you put H,O into the equation?
HCl(aq) + H20(e) > H*(aq) + Cl (aq) + H20¢e)
Notice  that the water is unchanged  when the reaction  is represented
this way. However,  you learned  earlier  that water is a polar molecule.
The O atom has a partial  negative  charge,  and the H atoms have partial
positive  charges.  Thus, H,O must interact  in some way with the ions H*
and Cl. In fact, chemists  made a discovery  in the early twentieth  century.
They realized  that protons  do not exist in isolation  in aqueous  solution.
(The hydrogen  ion is simply  a proton.  It is a positively  charged  nuclear
particle.)  Instead,  protons  are always  hydrated:  they are attached  to
water  molecules.  A hydrated  proton  is called a hydronium  ion, H3O0%(aq).

There is another  problem  with the Arrhenius  theory.  Consider  the
reaction  of ammonia,  NH3, with water.
NHa¢g) + HO ce) > NH *a(aq) + OH (aq)
Ammonia  is one of several  substances  that produce  basic solutions
in water. As you can see, ammonia  does not contain  hydroxide  ions.
However,  it does produce  these ions when it reacts with water. Ammonia
also undergoes  a neutralization  reaction  with acids. The Arrhenius  theory
cannot  explain  the basic properties  of ammonia.  Nor can it explain  the
fact that certain  other substances,  such as salts that contain  carbonate
ions, also have basic properties.
There is yet another  problem  with the Arrhenius  theory.  It is limited
to acid-base  reactions  in a single solvent,  water. Many acid-base  reactions
take place in other solvents,  however.
The Bronsted-Lowry  Theory  of Acids and Bases
In 1923, two chemists  working  independently  of each other, proposed  a
new theory  of acids and bases. (See Figure 10.4.) Johannes  Brgnsted  in
Copenhagen,  Denmark,  and Thomas  Lowry  in London,  England,  proposed
what is called the Brg@nsted-Lowry  theory  of acids and bases. This theory
overcame  the problems  related  to the Arrhenius  theory.
The Brg@nsted-Lowry  Theory  of Acids  and Bases
e An acid is a substance  from which  a proton  (H* ion) can be
removed.
e A base is a substance  that can remove  a proton  (H* ion) from
an acid.GETEEEEEY  For convenience,
chemists  often use H*(aq) as
a shorthand  notation  for the
hydronium  ion, H30° (aq).
Hydronium  ions do not exist
independently.  Instead,  they form
hydrogen  bonds with other water
molecules.  Thus, a more correct
formula is H*(H20),,,  where nis
usually  4 or 5.

J,
In many chemistry  references,
Bransted-Lowry  acids are
called "proton donors."
Bransted-Lowry  bases are
called "proton acceptors."
Although  these terms are
common,  they create a false
impression  about  the energy
that is involved  in acid-base
reactions.  Breaking  bonds
always requires  energy. For
example,  removing  a proton
from a hydrochloric  acid mole-
cule requires  1.4 x 10° kJ/mol.
This is far more energy  than
| the word “donor’ implies.
—/Like an Arrhenius  acid, a Brgnsted-Lowry  acid must contain  H in its
formula.  This means  that all Arrhenius  acids are also Brgnsted-Lowry
acids. However,  any negative  ion (not just OH’) can be a Brgnsted-Lowry
base. In addition,  water is not the only solvent  that can be used.
According  to the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory,  there is only one require-
ment for an acid-base  reaction.  One substance  must provide  a proton,  and
another  substance  must receive  the same proton.  In other words, an acid-
base reaction  involves  the transfer  of a proton.
The idea of proton  transfer  has major implications  for understanding
the nature of acids and bases. According  to the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory,
any substance  can behave  as an acid, but only if another  substance
behaves  as a base at the same time. Similarly,  any substance  can behave  as
a base, but only if another  substance  behaves  as an acid at the same time.
For example,  consider  the reaction  between  hydrochloric  acid and
water shown  in Figure 10.5. In this reaction,  hydrochloric  acid is an acid
because  it provides  a proton  (H*) to the water. The water molecule
receives  the proton.  Therefore,  according  to the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory,
water is a base in this reaction.  When  the water receives  the proton,  it
becomes  a hydronium  ion (H;0*).  Notice the hydronium  ion on the right
side of the equation.

(GEEECELS  The reaction  between  hydrochloric  acid and water, according  to the
Brensted-Lowry  theory
Two molecules  or ions that are related  by the transfer  of a proton  are
called a conjugate  acid-base  pair. (Conjugate  means "linked  together.")
The conjugate  base of an acid is the particle  that remains  when a proton
is removed  from the acid. The conjugate  acid of a base is the particle  that
results  when the base receives  the proton  from the acid. In the reaction
between  hydrochloric  acid and water, the hydronium  ion is the conjugate
acid of the base, water. The chloride  ion is the conjugate  base of the acid,
hydrochloric  acid.
According  to the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory,  every acid has a conjugate
base, and every base has a conjugate  acid. The conjugate  base and conju-
gate acid of an acid-base  pair are linked  by the transfer  of a proton.  The
conjugate  base of the acid-base  pair has one less hydrogen  than the acid. It
also has one more negative  charge than the acid. The conjugate  acid of the
acid-base  pair has one more hydrogen  than the base. It also has one less
negative  charge  than the base.
These ideas about acid-base  reactions  and conjugate  acid-base  pairs
will become  clearer  as you study the following  Sample  Problems  and

Section  Wrap-up
The two theories  that you have considered  in this section  attempt  to

key points of these theories.
In both the Arrhenius  theory  and the Brgnsted-Lowry  theory,  acids
and bases form ions in solution.  Many characteristics  of acid-base  behav-
iour are linked  to the number  of ions that form from a particular  acid or

Strong  and Weak Acids and Bases
Re-examine  Figure 10.1 on page xxx. Look at the photographs  of
hydrochloric  acid and acetic acid. The conductivity  tester is testing  the
same concentrations  of both acids. As you can see, the bulb glows brightly
in the hydrochloric  acid. The bulb glows dimly in the acetic acid. How
can these different  results  be explained?
Strong Acids and Weak Acids
You know that ions are present  in an aqueous  solution  of an acid. These
ions result from the dissociation  of the acid. An acid that dissociates
completely  into ions in water is called a strong acid. For example,
hydrochloric  acid is a strong  acid. Al/ the molecules  of hydrochloric  acid
in an aqueous  solution  dissociate  into H* and Cl ions. The H* ions, as
you know, bond with surrounding  water molecules  to form hydronium
ions, H;O0°. (See Figure 10.6.) The concentration  of hydronium  ions in a
dilute solution  ofa strong  acid is equal to the concentration  of the acid.
Thus, a 1.0 mol/L solution  of hydrochloric  acid contains  1.0 mol/L of
hydronium  ions. Table 10.4 lists the strong  acids.

When hydrogen  chloride  molecules  enter an aqueous  solution,  100% of the
hydrogen  chloride  molecules  dissociate.  As a result,  the solution  contains  the same per-
cent of H* ions (in the form of H30*) and CI" ions: 100%.
A weak acid is an acid that dissociates  very slightly  in a water solu-
tion. Thus, only a small percentage  of the acid molecules  break apart into
ions. Most of the acid molecules  remain  intact. For example,  acetic acid is
a weak acid. On average,  only about 1% (one in a hundred)  of the acetic
acid molecules  dissociate  at any given moment  in a 0.1 mol/L solution.
(The number  of acid molecules  that dissociate  depends  on the concentra-
tion and temperature  of the solution.)  In fact, the concentration  of
hydronium  ions in a solution  ofa weak acid is always  less than the
concentration  of the dissolved  acid. (See Figure 10.7.)10.2

When acetic acid molecules  enter an aqueous  solution,  only about 1% of
them dissociate.  Thus, the number  of acetic acid molecules  in solution  is far greater  than
the number  of hydronium  ions and acetate  ions.
Notice  the arrow that is used in the equation  in Figure 10.7. It points  in
both directions,  indicating  that the reaction  is reversible.  In other words,
the products  of the reaction  also react to produce  the original  reactants.  In
this reaction,  molecules  of acetic acid dissociate  just as quickly  and as
often as the dissociated  ions re-associate  to produce  acetic acid molecules.
(Figure  10.8 will help you visualize  what happens.)
Most acids are weak acids. Whenever  you see a reversible  chemical
equation  involving  an acid, you can safely assume  that the acid is weak.

When acetic acid dissolves  in water, acetic acid molecules  dissociate
and re-associate  at the same time and at the same rate.
A few acids contain  only a single hydrogen  ion that can dissociate.
These acids are called  monoprotic  acids. (The prefix  mono-  means “one.”
The root -protic  refers to “proton.”)  Hydrochloric  acid, hydrobromic  acid,
and hydroiodic  acid are strong  monoprotic  acids. Hydrofluoric  acid, HF, is
weak monoprotic  acid.
Many acids contain  two or more hydrogen  ions that can dissociate.
For example,  sulfuric  acid, HzSOa(aq),  has two hydrogen  ions that can dis-
sociate.  As you know from Table 10.4, sulfuric  acid is a strong acid. This
is true only for its first dissociation,  however.
H2SOa(aq)  > H*(aq) + HSOg (aq)
The resulting  aqueous  hydrogen  sulfate  ion, HSOTM4,  is a weak acid. It dis-
sociates  to form the sulfate  ion in the following  reversible  reaction:
HSO« (aq) = H*(aq) + SO4” (aq)
382. MHR-« Unit 3 Solutions  and Solubility
Thus, acids that contain  two hydrogen  ions dissociate  to form two anions.
These acids are sometimes  called diprotic  acids. (The prefix di-, as you
know, means “two.”)  The acid that is formed  by the first dissociation  is
stronger  than the acid that is formed  by the second  dissociation.
Acids that contain  three hydrogen  ions are called triprotic  acids.
Phosphoric  acid, H3POg(aq),  is a triprotic  acid. It gives rise to three anions,
as follows:
H3POa(aq)  + H20() (aq) + HePOs (aq)
H2PO«g (aq) + H20¢) = Faq) + HPO.” (aq)
HPO4 (aq) + H2O(e) = H* (aq) + POs*(aq)
Here again, the acid that is formed  by the first dissociation  is stronger
than the acid that is formed  by the second  dissociation.  This acid is
stronger  than the acid that is formed  by the third dissociation.  Keep in
mind, however,  that all three of these acids are weak because  only a small
proportion  of them dissociates.
Strong Bases and Weak Bases
Like a strong acid, a strong  base dissociates  completely  into ions in water. Table 10.5 Common  Strong Bases
All oxides and hydroxides  of the alkali metals—Group  1 ([A)—are  strong sodium  hydroxide,  NaOH
bases. The oxides  and hydroxides  of the alkaline  earth metals—Group  2
(11A)—below  beryllium  are also strong  bases.
Recall  that the concentration  of hydronium  ions in a dilute solution  of
a strong acid is equal to the concentration  of the acid. Similarly,  the con- strontium  hydroxide,  Sr(OH)2
centration  of hydroxide  ions in a dilute solution  of a strong  base is equal barium  hydroxide,  Ba(OH),
to the concentration  of the base. For example,  a 1.0 mol/L solution  of
sodium  hydroxide  (a strong  base) contains  1.0 mol/L of hydroxide  ions.
Table 10.5 lists some common  strong  bases. Barium  hydroxide,
Ba(OH)2,  and strontium  hydroxide,  Sr(OH)2,  are strong  bases that are
soluble  in water. Magnesium  oxide, MgO, and magnesium  hydroxide,
Mg(OH)z,  are also strong  bases, but they are considered  to be insoluble.
A small amount  of these compounds  does dissolve  in water, however.
Virtually  all of this small amount  dissociates  completely.
Most bases are weak. A weak  base dissociates  very slightly  in a
water solution.  The most common  weak base is aqueous  ammonia.  In a
0.1 mol/L solution,  only about 1% of the ammonia  molecules  react with
water to form hydroxide  ions. This reversible  reaction  is represented  inpotassium  hydroxide,  KOH
calcium  hydroxide,  Ca(OH).
Figure  10.9.
( 4—eS
NH, a H,0 =—— NH,7 + OH”
Ammonia  does not contain  hydroxide  ions, so it is not an Arrhenius  base.
As you can see, however,  an ammonia  molecule  can remove  a proton from water, leaving
a hydroxide  ion behind.  Thus, ammonia  is a Bransted-Lowry  weak base.

Conversely,  the conjugate  base

inverse  relationship.Naming  Acids and Their Anions
There are two main kinds of acids: binary  acids and oxoacids.  A binary
acid is composed  of two elements:  hydrogen  and a non-metal.  Two exam-
ples of binary  acids are hydrofluoric  acid and hydrochloric  acid. All bina-
ry acids have the general  formula  HX(qq). The H represents  one or more
hydrogen  atoms. The X represents  the non-metal.  As you can see in Table
10.6, the names  of binary  acids are made up of the following  parts:
e the prefix hydro-
¢ a root that is formed  from the name of the non-metal
¢ the suffix -ic
e the word “acid” at the end
Table 10.6 Examples  of Naming  Binary  Acids
Binary  acid | Prefix | Non-metal  root Suffix
hydrofluoric  acid, HF (aq) hydro-  | -fluor- -ic
hydrochloric  acid, HCl{ag)_| hydro-  | -chlor- -ic
hydrosulfuric  acid, H2S hydro-  | -sulfur- -ic
As you know, anions  are formed  when binary  acids dissociate.  The
names of these anions  end in the suffix -ide. For example,  hydroflouric
acid forms the anion fluoride,  F-. Hydrochloric  acid forms the anion
chloride,  Cl.
An oxoacid  is an acid formed  from a polyatomic  ion that contains
oxygen,  hydrogen,  and another  element.  (Oxoacids  are called oxyacids  in
some chemistry  textbooks).  In Chapter  3, you learned  the names of com-
mon polyatomic  ions and their valences  (oxidation  numbers).  The names
of oxoacids  are similar  to the names of their polyatomic  oxoanions.  Only
the suffix is different.  Study the three rules and examples  for naming
oxoacids  below. Then try the Practice  Problems  that follow.
1. For anions  that end in -ate, the suffix of the acid is -ic. For example,
the acid of the chlorate  anion ClO;, is chloric  acid, HCI1O3.
2. For anions  that end in -ite, the suffix of the acid is -ous. For example,

Describing  Acid and Base Strength  Quantitatively:  pH
You are probably  familiar  with the term “pH” from a variety  of sources.
Advertisers  talk about the “pH balance”  of products  such as soaps, sham-
poos, and skin creams.  People  who own aquariums  and swimming  pools
must monitor  the pH of the water. (See Figure 10.10.) Gardeners  and farm-
ers use simple  tests to determine  the pH of the soil. They know that plants
and food crops grow best within  a narrow  range of pH. Similarly,  the pH
of your blood must remain  within  narrow  limits for you to stay healthy.
ems  Maintaining  a
safe environment  for an aquarium
or a swimming  pool requires
measuring  the pH of the water
and knowing  how to adjust it. = = a a Xx
pH is clearly  related  to health,  and to the proper  functioning  of products
and systems.  (Notice  that the “p” is always  lower case, even at the start
of a sentence.)  What exactly  is pH? How is it measured?  To answer  these
questions,  consider  a familiar  substance:  water.
The Power  of Hydrogen  in Water
As you know, all aqueous  solutions  contain  ions. Even pure water con-
tains a few ions that are produced  by the dissociation  of water molecules.
Remember:  The double  arrow in the equation  shows that the reaction  is
reversible.  The ions recombine  to form water molecules.
H20e) + H20(e) = H30  faq) + OH faq)
On average,  at 25°C, only about two water molecules  in a billion  are
dissociated  at any given moment.  As you know, it is the ions in solution
that conduct  electricity.  If there are virtually  no ions, no electricity  is
conducted.  This is why pure water is such a poor conductor.  Chemists
have determined  that the concentration  of hydronium  ions in neutral
water, at 25°C, is only 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L. The dissociation  of water also
produces  the same, very small number  of hydroxide  ions. Therefore,  the
concentration  of hydroxide  ions is also 1.0 x 10°” mol/L.
Chemists  sometimes  use square  brackets  around  a chemical  formula.
This shorthand  notation  means “the concentration  of” the chemical  inside
the brackets.  For example,  [H3;0*] is read as “the concentration  of hydro-
nium ions.” Thus, the concentration  of hydronium  ions and hydroxide
ions in neutral  water can be written  as
the concentration  of hydronium  ions
[H,;0*] = [OH] = 1.0 x 10°” mol/L
{_the concentration  of hydroxide  ions
Chapter  10 Acids and Bases * MHR_ 385
Compared  with neutral  water, acidic solutions  contain  a higher  con-
centration  of hydronium  ions. Basic solutions  contain  a lower concentra-
tion of hydronium  ions. Therefore,  the dissociation  of water provides
another  way of thinking  about acids and bases. An acid is any compound
that increases  [H;O0*]  when it is dissolved  in water. A base is any com-
pound  that increases  [OH] when it is dissolved  in water. (See Figure
10.11.)

[H,0*] > [OH7] [H,0*] <[OH7] [H,O*] = [OH7]
(GGETECEL SED The relationship  between  the concentrations  of hydronium  ions and
hydroxide  ions in a solution  determines  whether  the solution  is acidic,  basic, or neutral.
The pH Scale: Measuring  by Powers  of Ten
The concentration  of hydronium  ions ranges from about 10 mol/L for a
concentrated  strong acid to about 107'° mol/L for a concentrated  strong
base. This wide range of concentrations,  and the negative  powers  of 10,
are not very convenient  to work with. In 1909, a Danish  biochemist,  Sgren
Sgrensen,  suggested  a method  for converting  concentrations  to positive
numbers.  His method  involved  using the numerical  system  of logarithms.
The logarithm  of a number  is the power  to which  you must raise 10 to
equal that number.  For example,  the logarithm  of 10 is 1, because
10! = 10. The logarithm  of 100 is 2, because  107 = 100. (See Appendix  E
for more information  about exponents  and logarithms.)
Sgrensen  defined  pH as —log [H*]. Since Sgrensen  did not know about
hydronium  ions, his definition  of pH is based on Arrhenius’  hydrogen
ion. Many chemistry  references  reinterpret  the H so that it refers to the
Brensted-Lowry  hydronium  ion, H;0*, instead.  This textbook  adopts  the
hydronium  ion usage. Thus, the definition  for pH becomes
pH = -log [H30°].  Recall,  though,  that chemists  use [H*] as a shorthand
notation  for [H3;0*].  As a result, both equations  give the same product.
66 39As you can see in Figure 10.12, the “p” in pH stands for the word
“power.”  The power  referred  to is exponential  power:  the power of 10.
The “H” stands  for the concentration  of hydrogen  ions (or H;0* ions),
measured  in mol/L.

of pH makes  working  with
very small values,  such as
0.000 000 000 000 01, much easier.
The concept  of pH allows  hydronium  (or hydrogen)  ion concentra-
tions to be expressed  as positive  numbers,  rather  than negative  exponents.
For example,  recall that [H30*] of neutral  water at 25°C is 1.0 x 10°”.
.. pH = —log [H30*]
= —log (1.0 x 10°”)
= —(—7.00)
= 7.00
[H30*] in acidic solutions  is greater  than [H3;0*] in neutral  water. For
example,  if [H;0*] in an acid is 1.0 x 10~* mol/L,  this is 1000 times greater
than [H;0*] in neutral  water. Use Table 10.7 to make sure that you under-
stand why. The pH of the acid is 4.00. All acidic solutions  have a pH that
is less than 7.

How do you determine  the
number  of significant  digits in a
pH? You count only the digits to
the right of the decimal  point.
For example,  suppose  that the
concentration  of hydronium
ions in a sample  of orange
juice is 2.5 x 10 mol/L. This
number  has two significant
digits: the 2 and the 5. The
power of 10 only tells us where
to place the decimal:  0.000 25.
The pH of the sample  is
—log (2.5 x 10) = 3.602 059.
The digit to the left of the deci-
mal (the 3) is derived  from the
power of 10. Therefore,  it is not
considered  to be a significant
digit. Only the two digits to the
right of the decimal  are
significant.  Thus, the pH value
is rounded  off to 3.60.
Identify  the significant  digits in
each pH value below.

Chemistry  Bulletin
Oven cleaning  is not a job that most people
enjoy. Removing  baked-on  grease  from inside
an oven requires  serious  scrubbing.  Any chemi-
cal oven cleaners  that help to make the job
easier are usually  welcome.  Like all chemicals,
however,  the most effective  oven cleaners
require  attention  to safety.
Cleaners  that contain  strong bases are the
most effective  for dissolving  grease  and grime.
Bases are effective  because  they produce  soaps
when they react with the fatty acids in grease.
When  a strong base (such as sodium  hydroxide,
NaOH,  or potassium  hydroxide,  KOH) is used on
a dirty oven, the fat molecules  that make up the
grease  are split into smaller  molecules.  Anions
from the base then bond with some of these
molecules  to form soap.
One end of a soap molecule  is non-polar
(uncharged),  so it is soluble  in dirt and grease,
which are also non-polar.  The other end of a
soap molecule  is polar (charged),  so it is soluble
in water. Because  of its two different  properties,
soap acts like a “bridge”  between  the grease
and the water. Soap enables  grease  to dissolve
in water and be washed  away, thus allowing
the cleaner  to remove  the grease  from the
oven surface.
392. MHR-= Unit 3 Solutions  and SolubilityCleaners  that contain  sodium  hydroxide  and
potassium  hydroxide  are very effective.  They
are also caustic  and potentially  very dangerous.
For example,  sodium  hydroxide,  in the concen-
trations  that are used in oven cleaners,  can
irritate  the skin and cause blindness  if it gets
in the eyes. As well, it is damaging  to paints
and fabrics.
There are alternatives  to sodium  hydroxide
and other strong base cleaners.  One alternative
involves  using ammonia,  NH3, which is a weak
base. If a bowl of dilute ammonia  solution  is
placed in an oven and left for several  hours,
most of the grease  and grime can be wiped off.
Ammonia  does not completely  ionize in
water. Only a small portion  dissociates.
Although  an ammonia  solution  ts less caustic
than sodium  hydroxide,  it can be toxic if inhaled
directly.  As well, ammonia  vapours  can cause
eye, lung, and skin irritations.  At higher  concen-
trations,  ammonia  can be extremely  toxic.
Baking  soda Is a non-toxic  alternative,  but it
is much less effective.  Therefore,  it requires
even more scrubbing.  An abrasive  paste can be
made by mixing baking  soda and water. The
basic properties  of baking  soda also have a
small effect on grease  and grime if it is applied
to the oven and left for several  hours.
Making  Connections
1. Survey  the cleaners  in your home or school.
Which cleaners  contain  bases and which con-
tain acids? What cleaning  jobs can an acid
cleaner  perform  well? How do most acid
cleaners  work?
. Some companies  claim to make environmen-
tally sensitive  cleaners.  Investigate  these
cleaners.  What chemicals  do they contain?
See if you can infer how they work. You
might like to design a controlled  experiment
to test the effectiveness  of several  oven
cleaners. Obtain permission  from
your teacher  before performing  such an
experiment.

between  hydrochloric  acid and

Is there a box of baking  soda in your refrigerator  at home?  Baking  soda is
sodium  hydrogen  carbonate.  (It is also commonly  called sodium  bicarbon-
ate.) Baking  soda removes  the odours  caused  by spoiling  foods. The
smelly  breakdown  products  of many foods are acids. Baking  soda, a base,
eliminates  the odours  by neutralizing  the characteristic  properties  of
the acids.
Adding  a base to an acid neutralizes  the acid’s acidic properties.  This
type of reaction  is called a neutralization  reaction.
There are many different  acids and bases. Being able to predict  the
results  of reactions  between  them is important.  Bakers,  for example,
depend  on neutralization  reactions  to create light, fluffy baked  goods.
Gardeners  and farmers  depend  on these reactions  to modify  the character-
istics of the soil. Industrial  chemists  rely on these reactions  to produce  the
raw materials  that are used to make a wide variety  of chemicals  and
chemical  products.  (See Figure 10.13.)

Neutralization  Reactions
The reaction  between  an acid and a base produces  an ionic compound
(a salt) and water.
acid + base > a salt + water
A salt is an ionic compound  that is composed  of the anion from an acid
and a cation  from a base. For example,  sodium  nitrate  is a salt that is
found in many kitchens.  It is often added  to processed  meat to preserve
the colour  and to slow the rate of spoiling  by inhibiting  bacterial  growth.
Sodium  nitrate  can be prepared  in a laboratory  by reacting  nitric acid with
sodium  hydroxide,  as shown  on the next page.

The balanced  chemical  equation  for this reaction  shows that 1 mol of
nitric acid reacts with 1 mol of sodium  hydroxide.  If equal molar
quantities  of nitric acid and sodium  hydroxide  are used, the result is a
neutral  (pH 7) aqueous  solution  of sodium  nitrate.  In fact, when any
strong  acid reacts with any strong  base in the mole ratio from the bal-
anced chemical  equation,  a neutral  aqueous  solution  of a salt is formed.
Reactions  between  acids and bases of different  strengths  usually  do not
result in neutral  solutions.
For most neutralization  reactions,  there are no visible signs that a
reaction  is occurring.  How can you determine  that a neutralization
reaction  is taking place? One way is to use an acid-base  indicator.  This
is a substance  that changes  colour  in acidic and basic solutions.  Most
acid-base  indicators  are weak, monoprotic  acids. The undissociated  weak
acid is one colour.  Its conjugate  base is a different  colour.
[ colour 1
H (indicator)(ag)  == H*+ (indicator) (aq)
_
In an acidic solution,  the indicator  does not dissociate  very much. It
appears  as colour  1. In a basic solution,  the indicator  dissociates  much
more. It appears  as colour 2. Often a single drop of indicator  causes a dra-
matic change  in colour.  For example,  phenolphthalein  is an indicator  that
chemists  often use for reactions  between  a strong acid and  a strong base. It
is colourless  between  pH 0 and pH 8. It turns pink between  pH 8 and
pH 10. (See Figure 10.14.)colour2
bo
A good indicator,  such as the phenolphthalein  shown here, must give a
vivid colour  change.
Chapter  10 Acids and Bases * MHR 395noe
If a small quantity  of an acid or
a base is spilled in a laborato-
ry, you can use a neutralization
reaction  to minimize  the
hazard.  To neutralize  a basic
solution  spill, you can add solid
sodium  hydrogen  sulfate or
citric acid. For an acidic solu-
tion spill, you can use sodium
hydrogen  carbonate  (baking
soda). Note that you cannot
use a strong acid or base to
clean up a spill. This would
result in another  hazardous
spill. As well, the neutralization
reaction  would generate  a lot
of heat, and thus produce  a
very hot solution.
CHECKPOINT
Show that the net ionic equa-
tion for the reaction  between
HNQ3 (a strong acid) and
NaOH (a strong base) results in
the formation  of water.

An old remedy  to relieve the
prickly  sting of a nettle plant is
to rub the area with the leaf of
a dock plant. The sting con-
tains an acid. This acid is neu-
tralized by a base that is pres-
ent in the dock leaf. Bees and
ants also have an acidic sting.
You can wash the sting with
soap, because  soap is basic.
You can also apply baking soda
(a base) to the skin for more
effective  relief. If you are stung
by a wasp, however,  you
should apply vinegar.  The sting
of a wasp contains  a base.
PROBLEM  TIPS
1. Make sure that the
values you use in your
calculations  refer to the
same reactant.  For exam-
ple, you can use the con-
centration  and volume  of
sodium  hydroxide  to find
the amount  of sodium
hydroxide  in this problem.
You cannot  use the con-
centration  of sodium
hydroxide  and the volume
of hydrochloric  acid.
2. Inthe solution,  the vol-
umes are converted  to
litres. If all the volumes
are expressed  in the
same unit, the conversion
step is not necessary.
3. Do not drop significant
digits, even zeros, during
your calculations.Calculations  Involving  Neutralization  Reactions
Suppose  that a solution  of an acid reacts with a solution  of a base. You
can determine  the concentration  of one solution  if you know the concen-
tration  of the other. (This assumes  that the volumes  of both are accurately
measured.)  Use the concentration  and volume  of one solution  to deter-
mine the amount  (in moles) of reactant  that it contains.  The balanced
chemical  equation  for the reaction  describes  the mole ratio in which  the
compounds  combine.  In the following  Sample  Problems  and Practice
Problems,  you will see how to do these calculations.

[HCl(aq)]  is greater  than [NaOH  {aq)]. This is reasonable  because  a
smaller  volume  of hydrochloric  acid was required.  As well, the

Acid-Base  Titration
In the previous  Sample  Problems  and Practice  Problems,  you were given
the concentrations  and volumes  you needed  to solve the problems.  What
if you did not have some of this information?  Chemists  often need to
know the concentration  of an acidic or basic solution.  To acquire  this
information,  they use an experimental  procedure  called  a titration.  In a
titration,  the concentration  of one solution  is determined  by quantitative-
ly observing  its reaction  with a solution  of known  concentration.  The
solution  of known  concentration  is called a standard  solution.  The aim of
a titration  is to find the point at which  the number  of moles of the stan-
dard solution  is stoichiometrically  equal to the original  number  of moles
of the unknown  solution.  This point is referred  to as the equivalence
point. At the equivalence  point, all the moles of hydrogen  ions that were
present  in the original  volume  of one solution  have reacted  with an equal
number  of moles of hydroxide  ions from the other solution.
Precise  volume  measurements  are needed  when you perform  a
titration.  Chemists  use special  glass apparatus  to collect  these measure-
ments. (See Figure 10.15.) As well, an acid-base  indicator  is needed  to
monitor  changes  in pH during  the titration.
GETSETSEY  A transfer  pipette (bottom)  measures  a fixed volume of liquid,
such as 10.00 mL, 25.00 mL, or 50.0 mL. A burette  (top) measures  a variable
volume  of liquid.
In a titration,  a pipette  is used to measure  a precise  volume  of standard
solution  into a flask. The flask sits under  a burette  that contains  the
solution  of unknown  concentration.  After adding  a few drops of indicator,
you take an initial  burette  reading.  Then you start adding  the known  solu-
tion, slowly,  to the flask. The end-point  of the titration  occurs  when the
indicator  changes  colour. The indicator  is chosen  so that it matches  its
equivalance  point.
Titration  Step by Step
The following  pages outline  the steps that you need to follow  to prepare
for a titration.  Review  these steps carefully.  Then observe  as your teacher
demonstrates  them for you. At the end of this section,  in Investigation

atic me: You can prevent  a
“stubborn”  drop from clinging  to
the pipette  tip by touching  the tip
to the inside of the glass surface.Rinsing  the Pipette
A pipette  is used to measure  and transfer  a precise
volume  of liquid. You rinse a pipette  with the solu-
tion whose  volume  you are measuring.  This
ensures  that any drops that remain inside the
pipette  will form part of the measured  volume.
1. Pour a sample  of standard  solution  into a clean,
dry beaker.
2. Place the pipette  tip in a beaker  of distilled
water. Squeeze  the suction  bulb. Maintain  your
grip while placing  it over the stem of the
pipette.  (If your suction  bulbs have valves,  your
teacher  will show you how to use them.)
3. Relax your grip on the bulb to draw up a small
volume  of distilled  water.
4. Remove  the bulb and discard  the water by
letting it drain out.
5. Rinse the pipette  by drawing  several millilitres
of solution  from the beaker  into it. Rotate and
rock the pipette  to coat the inner surface  with
solution.  Discard  the rinse. Rinse the pipette
twice in this way. It is now ready to fill with
standard  solution.
Filling  the Pipette
6. Place the tip of the pipette  below  the surface  of
the solution.
7. Hold the suction  bulb loosely  on the end of the
glass stem. Use the suction  bulb to draw liquid
up just past the etched  volume  mark. (See
Figure 10.16.)
8. As quickly  and smoothly  as you can, slide the
bulb off and place your index finger over the
end of the glass stem.
9. Gently roll your finger slightly  away from end of
the stem to let solution  drain slowly  out.
10. When the bottom  of the meniscus  aligns  with
the etched mark, as in Figure 10.17, press your
finger back over the end of the stem. This will
prevent  more solution  from draining  out.
11. Touch the tip of the pipette  to the side of the
beaker  to remove  any clinging  drop. See Figure
10.18. The measured  volume  inside the pipette
is now ready to transfer  to an Erlenmeyer  flask
or a volumetric  flask.
Transferring  the Solution
12. Place the tip of the pipette  against  the inside
glass wall of the flask. Let the solution  drain
slowly,  by removing  your finger  from the stem.
13. After the solution  drains,  wait several  seconds,
then touch the tip to the inside wall of the flask
to remove  any drop on the end. Note: You may
notice a small amount  of liquid remaining  in the
tip. The pipette  was calibrated  to retain this
amount.  Do not try to remove  it.iim cme Draw a bit
more liquid than you need
into the pipette.  It is easier
to reduce  this volume  than
it is to add more solution
to the pipettes.

Using more does not make the colour  change
easier  to see. Also, indicators  are usually  weak
acids. Too much can change  the amount  of
base needed  for neutralization.  You are now
ready to prepare  the apparatus  for the titration.

ume of liquid added during a titration  experiment.
It is a graduated  glass tube with a tap at one end.

contact  with all inner surfaces.
Hold the burette  over a sink. Open the tap, and
let the water drain out. While you do this, check
that the tap does not leak. Make sure that it
turns smoothly  and easily.
Rinse the burette  with 5 mL to 10 mL of the
solution  that will be measured.  Remember  to
open the tap to rinse the lower portion  of the
burette.  Rinse the burette  twice, discarding  the
liquid each time.

Carefully  open the tap. Drain the liquid into a
beaker  until the bottom  of the meniscus  is at or
below  the zero mark.
Touch the tip of the burette  against  the beaker
to remove  any clinging  drop. Check  that the
portion  of the burette  that is below  the tap is
filled with liquid and contains  no air bubbles.
Record  the initial burette  reading  in your
notebook.
Replace  the beaker  with the Erlenmeyer  flask
that you prepared  earlier. Place a sheet of white
paper under  the Erlenmeyer  to help you see the
indicator  colour  change  that will occur near the
end-point.

24.A meniscus  reader  is a small white card with a
thick black line on it. Hold the card behind  the
burette,  with the black line just under  the

volume  added from the burette  to the nearest
0.05 mL.TITRATION  TIP
If you are right-handed,  the tap
should be on your right as you
face the burette.  Use your left

408An Issue to
Island at Risk:
A Simulation
Background
Would  you rather  have fish—or  chips?  People  on
Prince  Edward  Island  are discovering  that their sources
of both of these food items are increasingly  at risk.
The fertile red soil of Prince  Edward  Island is
famous  for potato growing.  Agricultural  corporations
have been increasing  their potato plantings  on this
island province.  In the process,  they have been elimi-
nating other crops, which  has led to a monoculture.
(“Monoculture”  refers to the growing  of a single crop
in an area.) Potato pests are posing  a huge threat to
this profitable  cash crop, however.  Part of the problem
results  from the fact that the potato fields are very
close together.  To combat  the pests— potato bugs, in
particular—farmers  are applying  more and more pesti-
cides, fertilizers,  and herbicides  to the potato fields.
What are the environmental  effects of this heavy
use of pesticides  (insecticides  and herbicides)?  After
heavy rains on the island,  large numbers  of dead fish
have been found in the ocean, and washed  up on the
shore near the potato farms. The suspected  cause is
the leaching  of sodium  arsenite  and other pesticides
used in the potato fields. Sodium  arsenate  is a chemi-
cal used to kill both weeds and insects.  If the poison-
ing of the ocean waters  continues,  Prince  Edward
Island’s  unique  seafood  industry  will come to an end.

Suggestions  for dealing  with this problem  have
included:
¢ creating  a mandatory  untilled  area spanning
20 m next to waterways;
© growing  genetically  engineered  potatoes  that are
more blight-resistant.  These genetically  modified
potatoes  would  contain  genes from bacteria  that
have insecticidal  properties;
¢ employing  alternative  fertilization  and pesticide
methods  to reduce  the amount  of chemicals  used
on the potato crop; and
¢ rotating  crops (that is, alternating  types of crops
from year to year) so that the spread  of potato
bugs and the overuse  of soil would  be less of
a problem.
Plan and Present
1 Look up the properties  of sodium  arsenate  in either
the CRC Handbook  or the Merck  Manual.  As well,
search  the Internet  for an MSDS sheet about
sodium  arsenate.
2 Using your knowledge  of solutions  and dissolving,
explain  how the chemicals  from the potato fields
end up in the water with the fish. Make a diagram,
a poster,  or a PowerPointTM  presentation  that clearly
illustrates  the processes  involved  in this type of
aquatic  pollution.
3) Provide  a minimum  of two advantages  and two
disadvantages  of each of the four possible  solutions
to the problem.
4 The provincial  government  in Charlottetown  has
decided  that action  must be taken, in some form or
another.  The following  people  and organizations
have been invited  to participate  on a board to
develop  an action  plan:
e the P. E. I. Potato  Board
¢ the scientists  who helped  develop  the genetically
engineered,  blight-resistant  potato  variety
¢ the corporations  who want to buy the potatoes
and process  them
¢ people  who fish for their living
¢ potato farmers
(a) Your class will be divided  into groups,  and each
group will research  the point of view of one of
these interest  groups.  Consider  questions  such
as these:
¢ To what extent do landowners  have the right
to determine  how they use their land?
e¢ What recourse  should  the fishers  on P.E.I.
have available  to them to respond  to the
threat posed to their livelihood?
e What possible  consumers’  rights need to be
assessed  in analyzing  this issue?
(b) Before developing  an action plan, each group
should  decide  on and state clearly  their motive
and their mandate.  In other words,  what is the
reason  for their existence  as a group and to
whom  is the group accountable?  For example:
e Are the scientists  working  for biotechnology
companies  or are they doing pure research?
e What is each group’s  present  policy  regarding
issues such as environmental  protection
and sustainability?
e¢ What points  might  be included  in each
group’s  short-term  and long-term  action  plan?
(c) Make a one-page  summary  of your points to
hand out to other members  at the meeting.  A
large diagram,  poster,  overhead  transparency,
or PowerPoint”  slide will help your group
illustrate  how your action  plan:
e will affect the environment
¢ acknowledges  the scientific  realities  of the
leaching  situation
e satisfies  the needs of other interest  groups
(d) Hold a meeting  of the action  plan board, to
present  all points of view, and to try to reach
a consensus  on an action  plan.
Evaluate  the Results
Maa) Take notes on every point of view presented
during  the meeting.
(b) Decide  what you think the best solution  is, for
everyone  involved.  Why do you consider  it to be
the best solution?Assessment
After you analyze  this issue,
= Assess  the quality  and practicality  of
your solution.
= Assess  your solution  based on how clearly
the chemistry  concepts  are expressed
and communicated.
@ From what you learned  in Unit 3 about solutions
and water treatment,  do you think there could be
other chemical-based  solutions  to this problem  in
the future?  Give a chemical  explanation  of how the
leachates  might  be contained,  if such processing
were possible.
® Try to suggest  some safe, alternative  methods  of
reducing  weeds,  insects,  and harmful  microorgan-
isms. For example,  could boiling  water be used as
an effective  herbicide?  Would  this method  of
reducing  weeds  cause more problems  than it
would  solve?  Why or why not?

Atmospheric  Chemistry
D.. you realize that air turbulence
is caused  by the behaviour  of gases?
Turbulence  can be caused  by
changes  in air pressure  in the
atmosphere.  Airplanes  are designed,
however,  to adjust  to the behaviour
of atmospheric  gases. The combus-
tion in the engines,  the shape of the
airplane,  and the air mixture  that
passengers  breathe  are all designed
to take gas behaviour  into account.
Gas behaviour  and gas reactions
are part of everyday  life. For exam-
ple, photosynthesis  is a reaction
that uses carbon  dioxide  gas, along
with other reactants,  to produce
oxygen  gas. High in the atmosphere,
ozone gas interacts  with dangerous
ultra-violet  light to protect  us from
the Sun’s harsh rays.
Scientists  study gases to under-
stand how they react. This under-
standing  can help prevent  further
damage  to the environment.  It also
leads to advances  in gas-related
technology.  Carbonated  soft drinks,
air bags, medical  anaesthetics,  scuba
equipment,  and rocket  engines  are
all based on gas chemistry.
In this unit, you will learn
about the relationships  between  the
pressure,  temperature,  volume,  and
number  of moles of a gas. You will
see how all these relationships  are
combined  in the ideal gas law: an
equation  that predicts  the behaviour
of a gas in almost  any situation.
The Behaviour  of Gases
How many gases are shown in the main photograph  on the opposite
page? The only gas you can actually  see is the water vapour  in the clouds.
In fact, however,  many gases are present.  Our atmosphere  is made up of a
mixture  of different  gases. The most important  of these gases is oxygen,
which  we need to breathe.  But did you know that most of the air you
breathe  is composed  of nitrogen  gas? This fact is well known  to deep-sea
divers,  who encounter  problems  with nitrogen  gas when diving  far below
the surface  of the ocean.
Gases are important  in many different  areas, from medical  technology
to the food industry.  In this chapter,  you will learn how particles  behave
in the gaseous,  liquid,  and solid states. You will also learn about laws
that predict  the behaviour  of gases under different  conditions  of pressure,
temperature,  and volume.  As well, you will discover  some of the impor-
tant ways in which  gases are used in everyday  life.

the Kinetic  Molecular  Theory
Most of the universe  is composed  of plasma,  a state of matter  that exists at
incredibly  high temperatures  (>5000°C).  Under  normal  conditions,  matter
on Earth can only exist in the other three physical  states, namely,  the
solid, liquid, or gaseous  states. As you learned  in an earlier  course,  the
particle  theory  describes  matter  in all states as being composed  of tiny
invisible  particles,  which  can be atoms, ions, or molecules.  In this section,
you will learn how these particles  behave  in each state. You will also
learn about the forces that cause their behaviour.
Solids and Liquids
In previous  courses,  you learned  about the properties  of the different
states of matter.  You may recall that both solids and liquids  are
incompressible.  That is, the particles  cannot  squeeze  closer together,
or compress.  The incompressible  nature of solids and liquids  is not
due to the fact that particles  are touching.  On the contrary,  the particle
theory  states that there is empty  space between  all particles  of matter.
The incompressibility  of solids and liquids  arises instead  from the fact
that these particles  cannot  move independently  of each other. That is,
the movement  of one particle  affects  the movement  of other particles,
or is restricted  by them.
This is especially  true for solids. The particles  of a solid are held
together  in a framework,  called a crystal  lattice.  In a crystal  lattice,  the
positions  of solid particles  are relatively  fixed. This explains  why solids
have definite  shapes:  the particles  are unable  to slip past each other and
thus change  the shape of the solid.
Like solids,  liquid particles  cannot  move independently  of one
another.  They can slip past each other enough,  however,  to flow and
change  shape.
Another  property  of states of matter  is their motion.  According  to the
particle  theory,  all particles  that make up matter  are in constant  motion.
In solids,  the range of motion  of the particles  is the most restricted.  Each
particle  of a solid is only able to vibrate  around  a fixed point in the lattice
(see Figure 11.2). This is called vibrational  motion.  Since solid particles
are fixed in space, the degree  of disorder  is very low.
Particles  in the liquid state can move more freely than particles  in the
solid state, although  not entirely  independently.  Liquid  particles  move
with rotational  motion  as well as vibrational  motion.  This means  that the
particles  can rotate and change  position.  It explains  why liquids  are able
to flow and change  shape, but keep the same volume.  Since liquid parti-
cles move around  more than solid particles,  the liquid state has a higher
degree of disorder,  as shown  in Figure 11.3.
To summarise  the discussion,  particles  in solids and liquids  are
incompressible  and thus have definite  volumes.  The particles  in each state
cannot  move independently  of each other. Therefore  they are relatively
restricted  in their motion.  How are the properties  of gases different  from
those of solids and liquids?
418 MHR- Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
The Gas State
Unlike  solids and liquids,  particles  in the gaseous  state are able to move
independently  of one another.  Gas particles  are able to move from one
point in space to another.  This is called translational  motion.  Thus, gas
particles  move with all three types of motion:  vibrational,  rotational,
and translational.  Gas particles  move through  space in random  fashion.
However,  they do travel in straight  lines until their course  is altered  by
collisions  with other particles.  Because  gas particles  move freely, there is
a high degree  of disorder  in a gaseous  state.
Gas particles  move much faster than liquid  particles.  Liquids
always  flow to the lowest  point because  they are still greatly  influenced  by
gravity.  Because  gas particles  move so quickly,  gravity  does not affect
them as much. Gases flow in all directions,  including  upward  against
gravity,  until all of the available  empty  space is occupied.  This is why
gases expand  to fill a container.  (See Figure 11.4.)
Gases can be compressed,  unlike  both solids and liquids.  What is
different  about their particle  arrangement  that allows  for this? The space
between  gas particles  is much larger than the space between  liquid or
solid particles.  Even if gas particles  are moved  closer together  through
compression,  the distance  between  each particle  is still very large. The
particles  remain  in the gaseous  state. When gas molecules  are compressed
further,  eventually  the forces between  molecules  become  strong enough  to
hold the gas molecules  together.  At this point, the gas changes  to the liq-
uid state. This is known  as condensation.
Forces Between  Particles
You have examined  some properties  of solids, liquids,  and gases. You
have seen how the motion  of the particles  affects these properties.  Now
you will examine  how the particles  affect each other.
The particle  theory  states that there are attractive  forces between
particles.  The weaker  the attractive  force is between  particles,  the freer the
particles  are to move. Therefore,  attractive  forces between  particles  are at
their strongest  in the solid state. Attractive  forces are at their weakest  in
the gaseous  state.
The strength  of attractive  forces between  particles  in any physical
state depends  on two major factors:  type of force and temperature.  The
effect of temperature,  or kinetic  energy,  on the state of a substance  will be
covered  in greater  detail later on in this section.
Attractions  Between  Charged  Particles
What types of attractive  forces exist between  particles?  In Chapter  3, you
learned  that oppositely  charged  particles  attract  each other due to electro-
static attraction.  Ionic bonding  is one example  of electrostatic  attraction.
A positive  ion (an atom or molecule  that has lost electrons)  is attracted  to
a negative  ion (an atom or molecule  that has gained  electrons).  Ions form
very strong  ionic bonds. Since these attractive  forces are so strong,  ionic
compounds  usually  exist in nature  as solids. For example,  table salt
(sodium  chloride,  NaCl) is a solid crystalline  substance.  It has a high
melting  point and a high boiling  point.GFETICEER  Particles  in liquids

walls of their container.

What is a dipole?  Go back to
Chapter 3 or Chapter  8 to
refresh  your memory.Attractions  Between  Polar Molecules
Not all particles  are charged,  but attractions  can still form between  them.
You learned  about intermolecular  forces in Chapter  3. Intermolecular
forces are forces that exist between  neutral  molecules,  or between
molecules  and ions.
You know that some molecules  are polar due to their asymmetrical
shapes.  Sulfur dioxide  (SO2) is one example  of a polar molecule.  These
molecules  have a permanent  dipole effect. This means  that one end of
the molecule  is more positive,  and the other end is more negative.
Polar molecules  attract  ions and other polar molecules.
The partially  positive  end of one molecule  is attracted  to
the partially  negative  end of another  molecule.  This pattern
continues  throughout  the substance.  These dipole-dipole
forces of attraction  are not as strong as ionic bonds.  Thus sub-
stances  made up of polar molecules  can exist as liquids  and
gases. For example,  ethanol  (CH3;CH2,OH)  is polar, and exists as
a liquid.  You know this liquid as rubbing  alcohol.  Hydrogen
chloride  (HCl) is also polar. It is a gas under  normal  conditions
as shown  in Figure 11.5.

If you are having difficulty

the Chemistry  11 Electronic
Learning  Partner.learned  in Chapter  3 that weak dispersion  forces  form between
non-polar  molecules.  As temporary  dipoles  form, they cause molecules  to
move closer  together.  However,  these attractions  are temporary  and weak.
Thus, most small non-polar  molecules  do not hold together  long enough
to maintain  their solid or liquid forms. As a result, most small non-polar
molecules  exist as gases at room temperature.  For example,  carbon  diox-
ide (CO,) is a gas at normal  temperatures.
The Relationship  Between  Size and State
Dispersion  forces are also the primary  forces of attraction  between  large
non-polar  molecules.  However,  as these molecules  increase  in size, their
melting  and boiling  points rise. For example,  methane  (CH,) is a small
non-polar  molecule.  It has a very low boiling  point and exists as a gas at
room temperature.  Pentane  (C;H)2)  is a larger non-polar  molecule.
It has a higher  boiling  point, so it exists as a liquid at room temperature.
Pentane  has more sites along its length  than methane  does where  tempo-
rary dipoles  can form. The dispersion  forces add up, so that it takes
more energy  overall  to separate  the molecules.  This leads to a higher
boiling  point.
To summarize,  the state of a substance  depends  on the forces between
the particles  of that substance.  If the forces are very strong,  that substance
is likely  to exist as a solid. If the forces are weaker,  that substance  will
exist as a liquid,  or as a gas. The state of a non-polar  substance  also
depends  on the size of the molecule.  Smaller  non-polar  molecules  are
more likely to be gases. Larger  non-polar  molecules  will probably  exist as
liquids  or even solids. Table 11.1 shows  the forces discussed  in this sec-
tion ranked  in order of strength.

The Effect  of Kinetic  Energy  on the State of a Substance
There is one more factor that affects  the state of a substance:  temperature,
which  is related  to kinetic  energy.  A hotter substance  with high kinetic
energy  is more likely to overcome  attractive  forces between  molecules,
and exist as a gas. A cooler  substance  with low kinetic  energy  is more
likely to be a solid or a liquid.  This explains  why heating  a substance
causes  a change  in state. When  a solid is heated,  it gains kinetic  energy.
Eventually  it will melt, and become  a liquid.  When  you add kinetic
energy  by heating  a liquid,  it will boil and become  a gas. Earlier  in this
section,  you learned  that gases move much more quickly  than liquids  or
solids. This is because  gases have high kinetic  energy.
Kinetic  Molecular  Theory  of Gases
The particle  theory  of matter  does not discuss  the kinetic  energy  of parti-
cles. Kinetic  energy  is important,  however,  when describing  the unique
properties  of gases.
The kinetic  molecular  theory  of gases makes  the following
assumptions:
e The volume  of an individual  gas molecule  is negligible  compared
to the volume  of the container  holding  the gas. This means  that
individual  gas molecules,  with virtually  no volume  of their own,
are extremely  far apart and most of the container  is “empty”  space.
e There are neither  attractive  nor repulsive  forces  between  gas
molecules,
e Gas molecules  have high translational  energy.  They move randomly
in all directions,  in straight  lines. (See Figure 11.6, on page 423.)
e When  gas molecules  collide  with each other or with a container
wall, the collisions  are perfectly  elastic.  This means  that when gas
molecules  collide,  somewhat  like billiard  balls, there is no loss of
kinetic  energy.
e The average  kinetic  energy  of gas molecules  is directly  related  to
the temperature.  The greater  the temperature,  the greater  the
average  motion  of the molecules  and the greater  their average
kinetic  energy.
The kinetic  molecular  theory  describes  a hypothetical  gas called an
ideal gas. In an ideal gas, the gas particles  take up hardly  any space. Also,
the particles  of an ideal gas do not attract  each other.CHECKP@INT

Why Use the Kinetic  Molecular  Theory?
How and why did scientists  formulate  the kinetic  molecular  theory?
Experiments  into gas behaviour  demonstrate  that, under  normal  tempera-
tures and pressures,  nearly  all gases behave  in similar  and predictable
ways. The properties  and behaviours  of real gases can be generalized  into
a theory  of an ideal gas. This generalization  makes  it possible  for us to
calculate  mathematically,  with a high degree  of accuracy,  how real gases
will behave  under  varying  conditions.
Of course,  no gas is really “ideal.”  The ideal gas theory  ignores  certain
facts about real gases. For example,  an ideal gas particle  does not take up
any space. In fact, you know that all particles  of matter  must take up
space. Gas particles  are small and far apart, however.  Thus the space
occupied  by the particles  is insignificant  compared  to the total volume
of the container.  You will learn more about the behaviour  of real gases
in Chapter  12.

The earliest  use of pressure  in English  referred  to a burden  or worry
troubling  a person’s  mind. Scientists  found this a useful mental  model
to picture  what happens  when force is applied  to a specific  area. They
adopted  the word pressure  to describe  any application  of force over
an area.
Throughout  the rest of this chapter,  you will discover  how gases
behave  when they are under pressure  in a closed system.  A closed  system
is one with a constant  amount  of moles of a substance.  It is not open to
the atmosphere.  Gases in closed systems,  from COz in fire extinguishers
to Oz in oxygen  tanks, perform  important  functions  in our lives.
Understanding  the behaviour  of gases in closed systems  is essential  to
our safe and effective  use of gases.
How is Pressure  Calculated?
As you learned  in previous  studies,  pressure  is defined  in physical  terms
as the force exerted  on an object per unit of surface  area (P = F/A). One
commonly  used SI unit of pressure  is the pascal (Pa), equal to 1 N/m?.
More often, pressure  is reported  in kilopascals  (kPa), equal to 1000 Pa.
(You will learn about other units of pressure  later in this section.)
Assume  a student  with a mass of 51.0 kg is sitting on a chair. The
force the student  applies  to the chair is 500.0 N. If the surface  area of
the chair seat is 0.05 m?, the pressure  the student  exerts is
p= ~ 500.0N
A 0.05 m?
Figure 11.7 shows  how  a decrease  in surface  area can dramatically

A woman  with a mass of 50.0 kg exerts  a pressure  of about 21 kPa on the
floor as she walks.  If another  woman  with an equal mass is wearing  high heels, she
will exert a pressure  of about 5000 kPa as her heel hits the floor. This pressure  is approx-
imately  240 times greater  than if she were wearing  flat shoes!
MHR « Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
How does  a gas exert pressure?  In a sense, it
cannot  exert measurable  pressure  in the same way
that a solid or liquid can. The pressure  of a gas
is determined  by the kinetic  motion  of its compo-
nent molecules.  Suppose  hundreds  of billions  of
gas molecules  are in random  motion,  striking  the
entire inner surface  of their container.  Each colli-
sion exerts a force on the container’s  inner surface.
Picture  inflating  a basketball.  As you add more
and more air to it, more molecules  collide  against
the inside  wall of the basketball.  Each collision
exerts a force on the basketball’s  inner surface
area. The collective  number  of collisions  as well
as the strength  of the force form the net or overall
gas pressure.  Since the molecules  move in all
directions,  the net pressure  exerted  will be equal

GETIZEEETY  Torricelli's  barometerEarly Studies  of Atmospheric  Pressure
In the early seventeenth  century,  the Italian  scientist  Galileo  Galilei
(1564-1642)  developed  a suction  pump.  It used air to lift water up to the
surface  from about 10 m underground.  When drawn  from greater  depths,
the column  of water collapsed  before it reached  ground  level. Galileo
concluded  that the water could not be pumped  higher  because  it had
reached  the “limit of vacuum.”  Pumping  from any depth  beyond  10 m
required  a greater  pressure  from the suction  pump than was provided
by the atmosphere.  However,  Galileo  did not know exactly  how water
was being moved  up the tube.
From 1641 to 1642, Evangelista  Torricelli  (1608-1647)  served  as
Galileo’s  secretary.  He continued  Galileo’s  experiments  and concluded
that the weight  of air was pushing  down on the rest of the water. The
weight  of the air pushed  water up the column.  This was a logical  conclu-
sion since gas molecules,  like all matter  on Earth, are pulled  down by the
force of gravity.
Torricelli  did further  calculations  involving  the weight  of the atmos-
phere pressing  on the water. He then improved  upon the experiment
by using mercury,  which  has a density  13.6 times greater  than water.
He designed  the apparatus  which  we now know as the barometer,  shown
in Figure 11.10. Torricelli  filled a glass tube of 1 cm diameter,  closed  at
one end, with mercury.  He then inverted  the tube in a dish of mercury.
Some of the mercury  ran out of the tube. But about 760 mm of mercury
remained  in the tube. This is about 13.6 times less than the height  of
water that Galileo  could pump. It is the air pushing  on the mercury  in the
dish that keeps this 760 mm of mercury  in the tube.
Changes  in Atmospheric  Pressure
At first, Torricelli  considered  his experiment  a failure.  The height  of the
mercury  column  did not remain  constant  at 760 mm, but changed  slightly
as the weather  and air temperature  changed.  As you learned  in Grade 10,
these small changes  in the height  of the mercury  column  provide  us with
valuable  information.  We can predict  the weather,  in part, by looking  at
changes  in atmospheric  pressure.  For example,  if the atmospheric  pres-
sure decreases  suddenly,  a storm may be on the way.
Atmospheric  pressure  affects  us in other ways, too. People  who live at
high elevations,  such as in the Rocky  Mountains,  have less mass of air
above them. At lower atmospheric  pressure,  the boiling  point of water
decreases.  Because  the water boils at a lower temperature,  it takes longer
to cook food in boiling  water on a mountain  than at sea level.
The following  ExpressLab  demonstrates  atmospheric  pressure  in a
dramatic  way, showing  you firsthand  the tremendous  pressure  that the air
around  us can exert.

High Pressure  Injectors
When gas molecules  under high pressure  are
allowed  to escape  and expand,  they release
kinetic  energy.  This energy  has been harnessed  to
benefit  human health by powering  high-pressure
injectors,  better known as jet injectors.
Jet injectors  are hypodermic  syringes  that
use high-pressure  gas instead  of a needle  to
inject vaccines  under a patient's  skin. Dr. Robert
Higson  (1913-1996)  developed  the “Hypospray”
in the 1940s. This device used spring pressure
against  a plunger  to force a vaccine  through  a
tiny nozzle at 1000 km/h. The pressure  wasenough  to drive the vaccine  into the tissue of a
patient’s  arm without  breaking  the skin.
Today  jet injectors  use a tank of compressed
gas and an automatic  vaccine  dispenser  that
works  through  a pistol-like  injector.  When
triggered,  the new device releases  a measured
dose of vaccine  into a sterile chamber  and a
small volume  of gas through  a hose. As the
compressed  gas expands,  it forces  the vaccine
at high velocity  through  the injector’s  nozzle.
The process  is fast and simple,  ideal for perform-
ing mass vaccinations.  It also eliminates  the
problems  of disposing  of used syringes.  Also,
it protects  medical  personnel  from infection
through  accidental  needle  pricks.
In 1958, Higson  led a team that inoculated
about 90 000 people  in Asia and Africa against
polio, typhoid,  and cholera  using the Hypospray.
In 1965, the United Nation’s  World Health
Organization  used the jet injector.  The organiza-
tion freeze-dried  vaccines  for its successful
worldwide  smallpox  eradication  program.  For its
key role in eliminating  smallpox  from the list of
human  diseases,  the jet injector  earned  a new
name—the  “Peace  Pistol.”

For many years, atmospheric  pressure  was measured  in millimetres  of
mercury  (mm Hg). In the British  Commonwealth  and the United  States,
inches of mercury  were used. Standard  atmospheric  pressure,  the
pressure  of the atmosphere  at sea level and 0°C, is 760 mm Hg. More
recently,  in honour  of the work of Torricelli,  standard  atmospheric
pressure  has been defined  as 760 torr. 1 torr represents  a column  of
mercury  1 mm in height  at 0°C. Another  common  unit for measuring
pressure  is atmospheres  (atm), where 1 atm is equivalent  to 760 torr.
While mm Hg, torr, and atm are still used to measure  pressure,  especially
in technological  and medical  applications,  the SI units are pascals  (Pa)
or kilopascals  (kPa).
In other words,  standard  atmospheric  pressure  at 0°C is equivalent  to:
760 mm Hg = 760 torr = 1 atm = 101.3 kPa
Using  this relationship,  we can convert  from one unit to another.  For
example,  a pressure  of 100.0 kPa is equivalent  to

The Relationship  Between  Pressure  and Volume
Figure 11.11 shows a meteorologist  preparing  to release  a weather  balloon
partially  filled with helium  gas. As the balloon  rises, atmospheric  pressure
decreases.  The volume  of the balloon  increases.
= — ———- 7
(GGETECRERED  Weather  balloons  are partially  inflated  with helium.  They carry
specialised  instruments  to measure  varying  atmospheric  conditions  such as pressure,
temperature,  and humidity.
Since the helium  atoms inside the balloon  move randomly  in all
directions,  they constantly  bombard  all the area inside the walls of the
balloon,  exerting  a pressure.  With decreasing  atmospheric  pressure,  there
are fewer air molecules  to collide  with the outside  of the balloon.  As the
pressure  outside  the balloon  becomes  less than that inside the balloon,
the balloon  expands.  Given an expandable  container,  such as a balloon,
the volume  occupied  by the gas will increase  when external  pressure
decreases.  As external  pressure  increases,  gas molecules  are forced closer
together.  The volume  of gas then decreases.
428 MHR-» Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
When  we refer to the volume  of a gas, we are in fact talking  about the
volume  of the container.  The definition  of the volume  of a gas is the space
available  for gas molecules  to move around  in. The kinetic  molecular  the-
ory of gases assumes  that the volume  of each gas molecule  is essentially
zero. Thus, the amount  of space for them to move around  in is the volume
of the container.  For all gases, V,,, = the volume  of the container  holding
the gas. (Do not confuse  this with the molar  volume  of gases. You will
learn about molar volume  in Chapter  12.)
Think  about how the relationship  between  pressure  and area for
solids would  apply if you were testing  a gas in a three-dimensional
container.  You know that according  to the kinetic  molecular  theory,  gas
molecules  exert pressure  over the entire inside surface  of their container.
If the volume  of the container  is halved,  what would  happen  to the
pressure  of the gas inside the container?
Robert  Boyle (1627-1691)  was an Irish scientist  with an interest  in
chemistry.  He investigated  the relationship  between  pressure  and volume
of gases at constant  temperatures.  By making  careful  measurements  of the
volume  of a trapped  gas, he was able to describe  what happened  when
the pressure  exerted  on the gas was increased.  Figure 11.12 shows Boyle’s
experiment.  Boyle measured  the length  of the column  of trapped  air
compared  to the length  of the column  of mercury.  Since the length  of the
mercury  column  is directly  related  to its volume,  Boyle was able to
deduce  the relationship  between  pressure  and volume.

The Relationship  Between  the
Pressure  and the Volume  of a Gas
Boyle measured  the variance  in length  of a
column  of trapped  air. Since length  is directly
proportional  to volume  in a column  with a regu-
lar diameter,  this gave him an indirect  measure
of changes  in volume  of the air with increased
pressure.  In this activity,  air is trapped  inside
a sealed plastic  pipette.  You can measure  the
volume  of the trapped  gas in terms of the length
of the column  of air, the way that Boyle did more
than three hundred  years ago. You will measure
the applied  pressure  in terms of the number  of
turns of a clamp rather  than in kPa.

Boyle's  Law
In 1662, Robert  Boyle stated that the volume  ofa given amount  ofgas, at
a constant  temperature,  varies  inversely  with the applied  pressure.  In
other words,  as external  pressure  on a gas increases,  the volume  of the gas
decreases  by the same factor. This statement  is known  as Boyle’s  law.
Figure 11.13 illustrates  Boyle’s  law using a bicycle  pump.
1. With the piston pulled all
2. 3. the way out, the air pressurev inside a bicycle pump equals
the air pressure  outside.
2. If the piston is pushed
halfway  down the cylinder,
the volume  of the cylinder
is decreased  to one half its
original  value. The pressure
doubles.
3. If the piston compresses  the
air to one fourth its original
value,  the pressure  of the air
inside the pump will be four
times higher  than its original
value.
GETIEETETY  At a given temper-
ature, gas molecules  travel an
average  distance  (d,) before they
collide  with the container  wall.
When the volume  is decreased,
the gas molecules  travel a shorter
distance  (d,) before striking
the wall.Boyle found that this relationship
held true for all gases as long as the
. temperature  remained  unchanged.

until Pgas= Pext strike the container  walls more
often per unit time. This increases
the internal  pressure  of the gas. (With an increased  volume,  there are
fewer collisions  per unit time and a lower gas pressure  is exerted.)
In other words,  as the pressure  of a closed system  increases,  its vol-
ume decreases.  If the pressure  is decreased  by half, the volume  doubles.
We can write this relationship  mathematically  by using the proportion-
ality symbol,  a. V a 1/P means  that volume  is inversely  proportional  to
the pressure.
Mathematically,  the proportionality  sign (a) can be removed  by
introducing  a proportionality  constant  (k).

V=5xk or PV=k
432 MHR- Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
In Investigation  11-A, when you plotted  a graph of P versus 1/V, you
obtained  a straight  line. The slope of this line gives the value of the
proportionality  constant,  k. If the pressure  is tripled,  the volume  will
decrease  to one third of its original  volume,  such that Px V = k. The
value of k differs depending  on the gas sample  and the temperature.
Remember,  this mathematical  relationship  only applies  if the temperature
remains  constant.  A graph of P versus 1/V is shown  in Figure 11.15.

If the gas sample  is then subjected  to a change  in pressure,

\ yGases and Temperature  Changes
As you learned  in Section  11.1, the average  kinetic  energy  of gas mole-
cules is directly  related  to the temperature.  The greater  the temperature,
the greater  the average  motion  of the molecules  and the greater  their
average  kinetic  energy.  In other words,  the temperature  of a substance  is
defined  as the measure  of the average  kinetic  energy  of the molecules  in
that substance.
When substances  are cooled,  they lose kinetic  energy.  How does this
affect their volume?  Remember,  for an ideal gas, we can think of its
particles  as having  mass but no volume.  When  you perform  Investigation
11-B on page 438, imagine  air behaving  as an ideal gas. How do you think
air, in an expandable  container  will react to temperature  changes?
Temperature  and Volume
Sometimes,  scientific  discoveries  are made well before any technological
application  of them can be envisioned.  At other times, the desire to
develop  new technologies  leads to experiments  from which  discoveries
are made.
Jacques  Charles  (1746-1823),  a French  scientist,  was the first to fill a
balloon  with hydrogen.  He was also interested  in hot-air  balloons,  which
were being developed  in France  at the time. Charles  investigated  the
expansion  rates of nitrogen,  oxygen,  hydrogen,  and carbon  dioxide.  He
found that these gases all expanded  by the same ratio. For each degree
Celsius  increase  in temperature,  all of these gases would  expand  by a
certain  fraction.  This fraction  was 1/273" of their volume  at 0°C. For each
degree  Celsius  decrease  in temperature,  their volume  would  decrease  by
the same fraction.  Thus, if a gas at 0°C were to be heated  to 273°C, its
volume  would double.  This held true when the pressure  and the amount
of gas remained  constant.  Figure 11.16 shows the expansion  of the volume
of gas in a hot-air  balloon  as the air inside the balloon  is heated.
(GGETEGEERT)  These photographs  show the gradual  expansion  of a hot air balloon.
Since hot air is less dense  than cooler  air, the balloon  rises.

Gas Temperature  and Cryogenics
Some people  wish to be frozen  when they die,
trusting  that future technologies  will be able to
revive  them. This untested  process  is called
cryonics.  It was first suggested  by Robert  C.W.
Ettinger  in 1962. Ettinger  has since set up his
own Cryonics  Institute  in Michigan,  where
people  can have their bodies  frozen  and stored.
We still cannot  freeze and re-animate  higher
animals,  such as people.  Cryogenic  freezing,
however,  can suspend  the life of tissues  and
organs  used for transplants.  Cryogenics  has
also made many other technologies  possible.
It has proven  that science  and science  fiction
are often closer than we think!
The term cryogenics  can be applied  to all
temperatures  below  the normal  boiling  point
of oxygen,  or -183°C.
When substances  encounter  temperatures
this low, they often behave  strangely.  Liquid
helium,  for example,  becomes  a “superfluid”
at temperatures  below —270.97°C.  The principle
of “superconductivity”  is just as interesting
Cryogenically  cooled  rings made out of metals
such as lead and aluminum  become  “supercon-
ductors.”  They can keep currents  travelling  in
circles for hours even after scientists  have
removed  the original  source of electricity.
Scientists  have made use of the strange
things that happen  to matter  at low tempera-
tures. Superconductors  have been used to
make huge electromagnets,  like the one at the
Argonne  National  Laboratory  near Chicago.
Argonne’s  electromagnet  can produce  a
magnetic  field 134 000 times as strong  as
Earth’s.  It operates  on relatively  little power
because  of its superconducting  capabilities.
Such magnets  are used in nuclear  power
research  to find new nuclear  particles.  And
while cryogenics  has advanced  nuclear
science,  it also helps scientists  to study the
effects of nuclear  radiation.  Scientists  study
cryogenically  frozen  atoms suspended  in an
irradiated  state to understand  how nuclear
radiation  can harm human  health.Cryogenically  cooled magnets  are used in MRI
technology.
Cryogenics  produces  large-scale  amounts  of
nitrogen  and oxygen.  Scuba divers and astro-
nauts use compressed  oxygen  tanks that
provide  a six to eight hour supply  of oxygen.
Rocket  engines  use liquid oxygen  as fuel.
We use liquid nitrogen  to make ammonia  for
fertilizers,  to keep frozen  foods cold during
transport,  and to fast-freeze  these foods.
The list of applications  of cryogenics  is
long and varied,  and research  continues.
Maybe  Ettinger  is right and one day all of the
occupants  of the Cryonics  Institute  will live
again!

XNThe Kelvin Scale and Absolute  Zero
Charles  found that, regardless  of the gas tested,
the x-intercept  on a graph would  always  be
—273°C.  In 1848, Lord Kelvin  (1824-1907),  a
Scottish  scientist,  realised  the significance  of
this finding.  He reasoned  that at —-273°C,  molec-
ular motion  would  cease. At this temperature,
kinetic  energy  would  be zero. The volume  of
a gas would,  hypothetically,  also be zero.
Of course,  real gas molecules  do have
volume.  Also, at low temperatures  all gases
will condense  and change  state. Still, Kelvin

Temperature point for the scale, 0 K, is called absolute  zero.
atic enw Absolute  zero for
an ideal gas is —273.15°C  or OK,
the point at which all molecular
motion  theoretically  ceases.
at cet: As temperature
increases,  particles  move more
rapidly,  striking  the outside  of the
thermometer  with greater  force
and frequency.  The kinetic  energy
of the particles  is transferred  to
the particles  inside  the tube of
the thermometer.  The volume  of
the liquid inside the tube (usually
mercury  or coloured  alcohol)
expands.Figure 11.17 shows how absolute  zero can be
hypothesized,  based on data from experiments.  The modern  accepted
value for 0 K, derived  with equipment  more sophisticated  than that avail-
able to Charles,  is —-273.15°C.  Each unit in the Kelvin  scale is exactly  the
same as a unit in the Celsius  scale.
There are no degree signs used in the Kelvin  scale. More importantly,
there are no negative  values.  What would  happen  if you tried to calculate
a temperature  twice as warm as —5°C? Mathematically,  the answer  would
be -10°C,  but this is a colder  temperature.  When  mathematical  manipula-
tions are involved  in studying  gas behaviour,  you need to convert  degree
Celsius  temperatures  into kelvins.  This is done using the relationship
Tx = °C + 273.15 or °C + 273
Most often, you will round off and use 273 as the conversion  factor
relating  K and °C.
Charles’  Law
Although  Charles  discovered  that the volume  of a fixed amount  of gas
at constant  pressure  was proportional  to its temperature,  he never pub-
lished  this finding.  In 1802, Joseph  Louis Gay-Lussac  (1778-1850),  a
French  scientist,  made reference  to Charles’  work in a published  paper.
The relationship  between  temperature  and volume  has since become
known  as Charles’  law. Charles’  law states that the volume  of a fixed
mass of gas is proportional  to its temperature  when the pressure  is kept
constant.
As you can see from Figure  11.19 on page 442, the volume  of a gas
increases  or decreases  by a fixed increment  when subjected  to a change  in
temperature.  The algebraic  statement  of Charles’  law depends  on using
absolute,  or Kelvin,  temperatures.  This law is stated as V a T, where T
is measured  in kelvins.  (Figure  11.18 uses Charles’  law to explain  how a
thermometer  works.)
Introducing  a proportionality  constant  (k,), this relationship  can be
restated  as Vv
Tox
This relationship  only applies  if pressure  is kept constant  and tempera-
ture is given in kelvins.  If a sample  of gas is collected  at initial conditions
(i), this relationship  can be rewritten  asV=kT or
Vi_
T, =
440 MHR-= Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
Suppose  the gas sample  is subjected  to a change  in temperature.  Under
the final conditions  (f), there will be a volume  change  such that
Since both initial and final conditions  are equal to the proportionality
constant,  Charles’  law can be written  as

Thus, Charles’  law can be restated  as: the volume  of a fixed mass of gas
at constant  pressure  is directly  proportional  to its Kelvin temperature.

Gay-Lussac’s  Law
Aside from balloons  and syringes,  most containers  that are used to store
gases have  a fixed volume.  You know that temperature  is a measure  of
the average  kinetic  energy  of the molecules  making  up a substance.  If the
temperature  of a gas increases,  but the volume  of its container  cannot
increase,  what happens  to the pressure  of the gas inside?
Extending  the work of Charles,  Joseph  Louis Gay-Lussac  discovered
the relationship  between  temperature  and pressure  acting on a fixed

Problem
A cylinder  of chlorine  gas (Cl2) is stored in a concrete-lined  room for
safety. The cylinder  is designed  to withstand  50 atm of pressure.

the room next door causes  the temperature  in the storage  room
to increase  to 87.5°C.  What will the pressure  gauge read at this
temperature?

Compressed  Gases and Safety Concerns
The Gay-Lussac’s  law Sample  Problem  in this section  indicates  how care-
fully gases under  pressure  must be handled.  Chlorine  gas can cause seri-
ous respiratory  problems  and irritate  the skin and mucous  membranes.  In
extreme  cases, death from suffocation  could result from exposure  to this
gas. Yet chlorine  is an important  industrial  product.  Compounds  of chlo-
rine are used in bleaches,  oxidizing  agents,  and solvents,  and as interme-
diates in the manufacture  of other substances.
Compressed  gases are commonly  stored  in thick-walled
metal cylinders  designed  especially  for this purpose.  All
cylinders  must comply  with Canadian  Transport  Commission
(CTC) regulations.  Containers  must be permanently  marked  with
a serial number  and specifications  for the volume  of the cylinder
and the maximum  pressure  it can withstand.  Containers  must be
tested every five to ten years, with the date of the test stamped
on the cylinder.
Figure 11.22 on the next page shows  a typical  compressed
gas cylinder.  You can see that it is built to withstand  high
pressures.  There are other safety precautions  as well, however.
Most cylinders  used to store gases have safety devices
regulating  the internal  gas pressure.  The most common  of these
is a pressure  relief  valve. If the pressure  inside the cylinder
increases  to a dangerous  level, a spring  allows  the valve to open
and release  excess  gas until the internal  pressure  returns  to a
safe level. Some pressure  relief  valves  will close once excess

Cylinders  used to store gases such as acetylene  (C2Hz2),  that
could cause an explosive  chemical  reaction  at high tempera-
tures, are fitted with fusible  plugs. These plugs are designed  to
melt and allow gas to escape  at temperatures  lower  than those at
which  hazardous  reactions  can start. Fusible  plugs for acetylene
cylinders  are made of a metal alloy that melts at 100°C.
Not all compressed  gas cylinders  are fitted with pressure-
relief  valves or fusible  plugs. Cylinders  containing  toxic gases
such as chlorine  or phosgene  (COC],)  are one example.  These
gases could cause serious  harm to health  if released  into the
air in sufficient  quantities.  Therefore,  these gases, like all
compressed  gases, must be handled  with great care. They
must be stored in a well-ventilated,  dry area. The surrounding
storage  area must be fire-resistant,  and proper  fire-fighting
equipment  must be immediately  available.  Gas cylinders  should
never be stored  near electrical  circuits  that might spark or near
other ignition  sources  such as open flames.  Material  Data Safety

You may have heard a common  joke about Canadian  weather:  “If you
don’t like it, wait an hour and it will change.”  While this is an exaggera-
tion, atmospheric  pressure  and temperature  rarely  remain  constant  for
any extended  period  of time. Since the volume  of gases changes  when
pressure  and temperature  change,  standards  have been designed  to allow
a comparison  of different  gas volumes.
The average  pressure  of the atmosphere  at sea level is taken as stan-
dard pressure  (760 mm Hg = 760 torr = 1 atm = 101.3 kPa). The freezing
point of water (0°C or 273 K) is defined  as standard  temperature.
Together,  these conditions  are referred  to as standard  temperature  and
pressure  (STP). (See Figure 11.23.)  The normal  conditions  under  which
we live are referred  to as standard  ambient  temperature  and pressure.
These conditions  are known  as SATP, defined  as 25°C and 100 kPa.
How could we find what the volume  of a gas, measured  under
different  conditions,  would  be when changed  to STP or SATP?
Boyle established  that pressure  and volume  are inversely  proportional:
PiV; = PrV¢
Charles  found that volume  and temperature  are directly  proportional:
Vi _ Vp

Gay-Lussac  discovered  that pressure  has the same relationship  to
temperature  as volume  does:

Do you notice a pattern  here?
Pressure  and volume  are directly  related  to temperature,  and inversely
related  to each other. Write this as one law, and it is possible  to calculate
situations  in which  three variables  change  at the same time. The mathe-
matics  work out just as consistently  as in the two-variable  equations.
452. MHR-» Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
The Combined  Gas Law
Boyle’s  law can be used to solve for changes  in volume  when pressure
changes.  The gas must be in a closed system  and the temperature  must
remain  constant.  You can use Charles’  law to solve for changes  in volume
with temperature  changes.  This law works only in a closed system  in
which pressure  remains  constant.  Gay-Lussac’s  law can solve problems  in
which  the amount  and volume  of gas remain  constant  while the tempera-
ture and pressure  change.
As you learned,  Boyle’s  law (V a 1/P) is expressed  mathematically
as PV = k. Charles’  law (V © T) is expressed  mathematically  as V/T = k,
when temperature  is recorded  in kelvins.  Combining  these two
expressions  gives:
1 TVa p * T or Va Pp
Introducing  a new proportionality  constant  (k;), we can write
V= i x ks or PV = ksP T
This mathematical  relationship  is the combined  gas law.
If a sample  of a gas is trapped  at a measured  set of initial conditions,
the combined  gas law can be rewritten  as
PiVi _ 5TO
As this gas is then subjected  to changes  in pressure  and temperature,
the final condition  of the gas can be described  mathematically  as
Since both expressions  are equal to the same proportionality  constant  (ks),
the combined  gas law can be written  as

GPTISEEP 23 Before a volcano
erupts,  there is a tremendous
build-up  of fluid and gas
pressures  inside the volcano  due
to magma,  steam,  and gases.
GPTTCRER23  Geysers  form in
areas of early volcanic  activity
or after a volcanic  blast. They
should be approached  with
caution  since the hot water  that
erupts can cause severe  burns.Gases and Natural  Phenomena
Gases under  pressure  are responsible  for natural  phenomena  such as
volcanoes  and geysers.  On March  20, 1980, residents  in the northern  part
of Washington  state heard a rumble  from the mountains.  They were told it
was only a minor  earthquake.  By March  27, seismologists  were sure that
something  more was involved.  Deep inside one of the mountains,  Earth’s
crust was moving.  The lower portion  of the crust was melting  into hot
liquid called magma.  The magma  started  rising up through  cracks in the
crust. Trapped  water quickly  turned  into superheated  steam. Trapped
gases added to the increasing  pressure  inside the mountain.  Then, on
May 18, 1980, the top half of Mount  St. Helens  blew away in a gigantic
explosion.  It released  all of the built-up  pressure,  along with many tonnes
of rock and ash, twenty  kilometres  into the atmosphere.  It also released
steam, and gases such as carbon  dioxide,  nitrogen,  and sulfur dioxide.
(See Figure 11.24.)
Other gases released  in volcanic  explosions  include  the oxides,  sulfides,
and chlorides  of carbon,  sulfur, hydrogen,  chlorine,  and fluorine.  These
include  CO,, CO, SQ2, SO3, Hz, H2S, Cle, HCl, and Fy». It is estimated  that
the eruption  of Mt. Pinatubo  in the Philippines  on June 15, 1991 released
about 1.8 x 107° kg of gases and ash into the atmosphere.
After a volcanic  blast, or in an area of volcanic  activity,  geysers  may
form. Cool water from Earth’s  surface  trickles  down  between  rocks. It
drains deep into Earth’s  crust, into regions  where  hot magma is still
present.  As the water is heated,  it forms steam. The steam rises back up
though  fissures  and cracks,  meeting  more water and heating  it up as well.
More and more boiling  water accumulates,  until suddenly,  through  a
narrow  opening,  the pressurized  hot water is violently  ejected.  As the
water cools in the air, it falls back and the process  starts again.
Yellowstone  National  Park in the United  States has one of the most
famous  geysers  in the world, Old Faithful.  It erupts approximately  once
every sixty-five  minutes.  (Figure  11.25 shows Old Faithful  erupting.)

Dalton’s  Law of Partial Pressures
What if there are two gases in one container,  or as in the case of the
atmosphere,  a mixture  of many gases?  How does this affect the pressure?
The English  scientist  John Dalton  did a very thorough  analysis  of the
atmosphere.  He concluded  that it comprised  about 79% nitrogen  and 21%
oxygen.  (See Table 11.2 to find out how close he really was.) Dalton  noticed
that the water vapour,  however,  seemed  quite variable,  so he did further
experiments.  He obtained  some very dry air, and measured  the pressure
in the container.  He then introduced  some water vapour.  The pressure
increased!  Dalton  repeated  and adjusted  his experiment  time after time,
always  with the same results.  He concluded  that the total pressure  of a
mixture  of gases is the sum of the pressures  of each of the individual  gases.
This is called  Dalton’s  Law of partial  pressures.  (See Figure 11.27 below.)

Dalton  extended  this idea to enhance  what he had discovered  about the
composition  of the atmosphere.  If the atmosphere  is 79% nitrogen,  and
the atmospheric  pressure  on a certain  day is, for example,  101.3 kPa,
then he concluded  that the nitrogen  itself must be contributing

\.Problem
What is the pressure  contribution  of CO, to the atmospheric  pressure
on a very dry day when the barometer  read 0.98 atm? Convert  your
answer  into three different  units.
What Is Required?
You must find the contribution  of CO, to the atmospheric  pressure,
and then convert  the units.
What Is Given?
e According  to Table 11.2, CO, contributes  0.03% of the
atmospheric  pressure.  The total atmospheric  pressure  is 0.98 atm.
The conversion  factors  of pressure  are
1 atm = 760 torr = 760 mm Hg = 101.3 kPa
Plan Your Strategy
e You need to multiply  the total atmospheric  pressure  times CO2’s
contribution  to the total.
e Then you can multiply  the answer  in atm by the conversion  factors
to cancel out atm and obtain other units.
Act on Your Strategy

In the previous  section,  you learned  about  the colourless,  odorless
mixture  of gases that make up the atmosphere.  It is easy to take the air
around  us for granted.  You know that you need oxygen  to breathe,  but
does it serve any other purposes?  Nitrogen  is not required  for respiration,
but it composes  about four-fifths  of our atmosphere.  Is nitrogen  a
“useless”  gas? In this section,  you will learn about how gases are used.
You will find out more about oxygen  and nitrogen,  and discover  the
importance  of gases in deep-sea  exploration.
Compressed  Oxygen
You may never really think about breathing—until  it becomes  hard to do.
In certain  situations,  normal  human  respiratory  functions  are disrupted.
Hospitals  use compressed  oxygen  for patients  with respiratory  disorders
such as emphysema,  pneumonia,  or lung cancer.
You may have heard of hyperbaric  oxygen  (HBO) chambers  being used
to treat sports injuries. A high oxygen  concentration  in the blood causes
blood vessels  to constrict.  This lowers  the swelling  that can occur in
injured  tissues.  How is this high oxygen  content  delivered  to the blood?
In an HBO chamber  such as that shown  in Figure 11.28, air is compressed
to three times normal  atmospheric  pressure.  The patient  breathes  pure
oxygen  (Ozig)) through  a mask. The highly  compressed  air forces Ogi) in
the lungs into the blood. This increases  of dissolved  Oxi) in the blood-
stream.  Consequently,  oxygen  is delivered  rapidly  to all the blood vessels
of the body. In fact, oxygen  can reach the injured  tissue at 15 times the
normal  rate!
The use of compressed  oxygen  can benefit  not only athletes,  but also
vulnerable  premature  babies.  Premature  babies can be afflicted  with hya-
line-membrane  disease.  This condition  prevents  the alveoli  in their lungs
from inflating,  which  leads to serious  breathing  difficulties.  Placing  these
babies in an oxygen-rich  environment  such as an HBO or an incubator
(Figure  11.28) helps inflate the alveoli.  This increases  the infants’  chances
for survival.

Oxygen  at High Altitudes
At other times, respiratory  functions  may be normal,  but the environment
poses problems.  Commercial  jet planes  fly at an altitude  of around  9.5 km.
Airplanes  carry pressurized  oxygen  for their passengers  to breathe  as they
fly at high altitudes.  Mountain  climbers  also need compressed  oxygen
when climbing  to great heights.  Those exploring  ocean depths  need oxy-
gen as well. Scuba divers and submarine  crews need compressed  oxygen
to breathe  when they are underwater.  You will learn more about undersea
exploration  later in this section.
Cancer  Research  Specialist
The National  Cancer  Institute  of Canada  estimates
that in the year 2000 there were more than
132 000 new cases of cancer  and 65 000 deaths
caused  by cancer  in Canada.  People  are desper-
ate for treatment.
Dr. Abdullah  Kirumira,  President  and lead
scientist  at BioMedica  Diagnostics  in Windsor,
Nova Scotia, has developed  a way to speed up
drug testing.  This method  uses compressed
carbon  dioxide  and a dry chemistry  diagnostics
system  including  the firefly enzyme,  luciferase.
Growing  Cancer  Cells for Testing
To obtain a consistent  supply  of cancer  cells to
test, CO. is pumped  from a compressed  gas
cylinder.  It is depressurized  through  a regulatorinto a specially  designed  incubator  kept at about
37°C, the optimum  temperature  for cell growth.
This CO2-enriched  atmosphere  plays two roles:
e it is required  for rapid cellular  metabolism;  and
e it interacts  with a bicarbonate  buffer in the
growth  medium  to maintain  an optimum  pH
balance.
Global Ties
In 1975, during  the reign of dictator  Idi Amin,
Dr. Kirumira  fled his native Uganda  to Iraq,
where he earned  a B.Sc. in food technology.
He then travelled  to England  for a Master's
degree  in dairy chemistry.  From there, he moved
to Australia  where he earned  his Ph.D. in
biotechnology.  In 1990, he and his wife moved  to
Nova Scotia in search of a slower-paced  lifestyle.
At BioMedica,  Dr. Kirumira  oversees
12 employees,  six of whom have advanced
degrees,  three technicians  and three administra-
tors. In addition,  Dr. Kirumira  teaches  biochem-
istry and biotechnology  at Acadia  and Dalhousie
Universities.
He frequently  visits his home in Uganda.
From Uganda,  Dr. Kirumira  says he can “take
back what | have learnt from the West to help
the people  who probably  need it the most.”

CO, is a greenhouse  gas,
thought  to contribute  to global
warming.  Many countries
around  the world have sought
to reduce  their emissions  of
CO». International  climate con-
trol treaties,  such as the
Montréal  Protocol,  have set
targets  to do this.
Since plants cycle CO, out of
the atmosphere,  several  coun-
tries including  Canada  have
argued  that countries  with
large forest resources  should
be able to claim them as “car-
bon sinks.” Rather than cutting
their CO) emissions  by the tar-
get amount,  Canada and other
countries  maintain  that they
should be allowed  to claim a
reduction  for the CO. absorbed
by their large forests.

GETEEREES)  Liquid water becomes  water vapour
when exposed  to the heat of a fire. Firefighters  must
take precautions  to avoid steam burns.Oxygen  and Combustion
A fire breaks out and smoke  begins  to fill the room. Breathing  becomes
difficult.  Should  you open a window  to let the smoke out before you leave
through  the door? You may have learned  you should  never open windows
before leaving  the area of a fire. A fire can only burn as long as it has
sufficient  oxygen.  (See Figure 11.29.)
Oxygen  is an extremely  important  gas because  it supports  combustion.
(You will learn more about combustion  reactions  in Unit 5.) The more
oxygen  available,  the hotter  a fire will burn. Pressurized  oxygen  is used
in the manufacture  of steel and specialized  alloys.  In the manufacture  of
steel, oxygen  is used to remove  excess carbon  by burning  the carbon  into
carbon  monoxide  or carbon  dioxide.  High levels of carbon  make steel too
brittle for many uses.
A remarkable  invention  called  the fuel cell is used by the space
industry.  Some fuel cells burn hydrogen  and oxygen  gas, leaving  water as
a by-product  (which  astronauts  can then drink).  Companies  such as
Ballard  Power  Systems  Inc. of Vancouver,  British  Columbia  are working  to
make this technology  practical  for automobiles.  Fuel cells are completely
non-polluting.  However,  the current  process  for making  large amounts  of
hydrogen  gas does create a good deal of pollution,  in the form of CO2.
Coal or another  hydrocarbon  is used to heat up and decompose  water in a
reaction  similar  to the following:
heat
CHavg) + 2H20¢)  > CO2¢) + 4H)
Before astronauts  can use the fuel cell in space, they first have to get
there! Liquid  oxygen  is an important  component  of rocket  fuel. Liquid
hydrogen  and liquid oxygen  are mixed  and ignited  in a combustion
chamber.  This reaction  provides  a very rapid expansion  of gas. It produces
enough  energy  to lift extremely  heavy rockets  carrying  crewed  vessels,
such as the Space Shuttle,  into orbit (Figure  11.30).
GETTER)  The large centre tank that is attached  to the shuttle
orbiter  has two compartments,  one containing  liquid hydrogen  and
the other containing  liquid oxygen.  The energy  released  by the reac-
tion between  these two substances  provides  the thrust needed  to
propel the orbiter  into space.

Nitrogen’s  Many Uses
Inert gases are not very reactive.  The word inert is also a synonym  for
sluggish  and slow. Something  with the property  of inertness  hardly
sounds  useful! Yet this very property  makes  nitrogen  extremely  valuable
in technological  and industrial  applications.
Because  nitrogen  gas reacts with very few substances,  it can be used
to blanket  substances,  preventing  them from reacting  with oxygen.  (A
reaction  with oxygen  is called oxidation.)  Blanketing  means  covering
something  with nitrogen,  displacing  all of the oxygen.  This usually  hap-
pens in a closed  container.  For example,  ground  coffee can taste bitter
when exposed  to oxygen  for long periods  of time. Packaging  coffee in a
nitrogen-enhanced  container  helps coffee keep its flavour.  Gaseous  nitro-
gen is also used for the long-term  storage  of fruits such as apples,  allowing
us to enjoy a wide variety  of produce  out of season.
Liquid  nitrogen’s  low boiling  point (77 K) means  that it can be used in
food preservation.  Foods frozen  quickly  in liquid nitrogen  retain more
nutrients  than slowly  frozen  foods. Less damage  is done to cell structure
during  the quick-freezing  process.  Freezing  foods this way also removes
moisture,  decreasing  their weight  and size. Freeze-dried  foods are often
used by people  who require  easily portable,  lightweight  food, such as
campers,  the military,  and space explorers.
In cryosurgery,  liquid nitrogen  is used to fast-freeze  cancerous  tissues
and warts. This proven  new technique  kills the cancerous  area and allows
surgeons  to safely remove  the dead tissue.
Gases and Undersea  Exploration
Throughout  history,  humans  have tried to explore  the little-known  world
of the deep seas. Even with modern  diving  gear, the deep oceans  are a
dangerous  place for humans.  The air that a diver breathes  to stay alive
underwater  can itself be one of the greatest  hazards.  That’s  because  of the
tremendous  pressure  exerted  by the waters above a diver. For roughly
every 10 metres  of depth, water pressure  on the diver’s  body adds the
equivalent  of one unit of atmospheric  pressure  (Figure  11.31).
The air that a diver breathes  (mainly  nitrogen  and oxygen)  must equal
the pressure  of the surrounding  water if the diver’s  lungs are to stay
inflated.  Of course,  this gas pressure  increases  as a diver goes deeper.
As the gas pressure  increases,  the diver’s  bloodstream  and body tissues
absorb  higher  and higher  volumes  of gases.
Beyond  depths  of roughly  40-60 metres,
the increased  volumes  of gas in the diver’s  body
can cause nitrogen  narcosis.  When  nitrogen
narcosis  strikes,  normal  feelings  become  danger-
ously exaggerated.  A diver may experience  a
blissful  giddiness,  along with disorientation  and
impaired  judgement.  This condition  is called
“rapture  of the deep.”  Divers  in this state
have been known  to remove  their breathing
apparatus  to swim like fish, mistake  up for
down, or simply  lose track of how long they
have been underwater.
At the other extreme,  a diver’s  normal  sense
of caution  may degenerate  into irrational  fear or (GEPESEREES]  At 50 m underwater,  a diver experiences  pressure

their use.worst thing—rush  to the surface  without  pausing  to decompress  on the
way up. Why is this dangerous?
The dissolved  gases such as nitrogen  in the diver’s  bloodstream  are
under  pressure.  This is much like the carbon  dioxide  that is dissolved  in a
can of soda. If the diver returns  to the surface  too quickly,  these dissolved
gases behave  similarly  to the gas in soda when a can is opened.  The gases
escape  from the blood as bubbles  in the diver’s  blood vessels.  These bub-
bles can block the flow of blood. They produce  a painful  and potentially
fatal condition  called “the bends.”
Both nitrogen  narcosis  and the bends make prolonged  deep diving  a
risky business.  They limit both the safe depth and safe duration  of human
diving.  Even skilled  professional  divers  rarely descend  beyond  about
50 metres.  Also, they rarely remain  at that depth for much more than
30 minutes.

Exploring  Gas Laws
You are probably  used to sharing  scientific  ideas and observations  with
your classmates  as you work in pairs or in small groups.  If you are famil-
iar with Internet  chat rooms and e-mail,  you may even share your ideas
with people  around  the world. Sharing  scientific  ideas is an essential  part
of scientific  discovery.  Back in the early nineteenth  century,  the ideas that
led to the complete  gas laws were shared  between  colleagues  in much the
same way that you share scientific  ideas with your classmates.
During  the nineteenth  century,  scientists  across Europe  organized
academies,  or science  societies.  (This practice  still exists today.)
Belonging  to an academy  allowed  much more communication  among
scientists.  They read the papers  and reports  that other scientists  had
published,  wrote letters,  and held meetings  to discuss  ideas. They worked
together  to develop  many important  theories  and laws, including  the
gas laws.
In this chapter,  you will study more of the gas laws. Although  these
laws were discovered  almost  200 years ago, they are still accepted  today.
You will learn how the gas laws allow you to solve many problems
involving  gas behaviour.  You will also learn about some of the modern
applications  and technological  advances  associated  with the gas laws.
You will have a chance  to test the gas laws through  your own experiments
and to compare  your results  with those of early scientists.  Finally,  you
will learn about some of the gas reactions  that occur in our atmosphere.

The information  that was shared by these three scientists  led to the gas
laws that we use today.
The Molar  Volume  of Gases
Gay-Lussac  measured  the volumes  of gases before and after a reaction.
His research  led him to devise  the law of combining  volumes:  When  gases
react, the volumes  of the reactants  and the products,  measured  at equal
temperatures  and pressures,  are always  in whole number  ratios. For
example,  2 volumes  of hydrogen  gas react with 1 volume  of oxygen  gas
to produce  2 volumes  of water vapour.
472 MHR-* Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
John Dalton  examined  the masses  of compounds  before and after a
reaction.  Dalton’s  research  led him to propose  the law of multiple
proportions:  The masses  of the elements  that combine  can be expressed
in small whole number  ratios.
By combining  these ideas, Avogadro  related  the volume  of a gas to the
amount  that is present  (calculated  from the mass). Avogadro  divided
Dalton’s  mass ratios by the molar masses  of the elements  to obtain  the
mole ratios. He realized  that these mole ratios were the same as the vol-
ume ratios that Gay-Lussac  had obtained.  For example,  1 L of hydrogen
gas reacts with 1 L of chlorine  gas. Avogadro  decided  that there must be
the same number  of molecules  in each litre of gas. Thus, Avogadro’s
hypothesis  was formulated:  Equal volumes  of all ideal gases at the same
temperature  and pressure  contain  the same number  of molecules.
Figures  12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 show the three reactions  that produced
Gay-Lussac’s  confusing  observations.  You can see that the mole ratios are
the same as the volume  ratios. Today our knowledge  of atoms and mole-
cules helps us understand  Gay-Lussac’s  results.  We know that gases are
made of molecules  that may contain  more than one atom.

Step 2 Since the pressure  increases  from 98.0 kPa to 101.3 kPa,
the volume  will decrease.  Multiply  the initial volume  by a
pressure  ratio that is less than 1. Since the temperature
decreases  from 295 K to 273 K, the volume  will decrease
further.  Multiply  the initial volume  by a temperature  ratio
that is less than 1.
Step3 Since there is less than 1 mol of nitrogen  gas present,  the
volume  of 1 mol of nitrogen  gas (the molar volume)  will be
greater  than the volume  you calculated  in step 2. To find
the molar volume,  multiply  by a mole ratio that is greater

repeated  their procedure  for oxygen  gas and for
methane  gas.
Finally,  the students  found the temperature

What are the temperature  and
pressure  at STP? Go back to
section 11.4 to remind yourself.In the Thought  Lab, you found that the molar  volume  of one gas is roughly
the same as the molar volume  of another  gas at the same temperature  and
pressure.  In fact, the molar  volume  of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.
Figure 12.5 shows a balloon  with a volume  of 22.4 L compared  to some
common  objects.  This is a fairly large volume  of gas. For example,  a
basketball  has a volume  of only 7.5 L.
GETEX  One mole of any gas at STP occupies  22.4 L (22.4 dm*). How large is 22.4 L?
The other objects  are shown  for comparison.
In Chapter  11, you learned  that temperature,  pressure,  and volume  are
related.  Based on Avogadro’s  law, the number  of moles is related  to the
temperature,  pressure,  and volume  of a gas. Therefore,  Avogadro’s  law can
be applied  to solve gas problems  involving  moles and volume,  when the
temperature  and pressure  remain  constant.  Figure 12.6 explains  the rela-
tionship  among  temperature,  pressure,  volume,  and number  of moles of
a gas.
The following  Sample  Problems  show you how to do gas calculations

GEEEEEEZS  At a temperature  (7), a given amount  of a gas (1) produces  a pressure  (P).
When more gas is added,  the number  of moles (n) increases.  This results in more molec-
ular collisions  with the container  walls,  thus increasing  the pressure  of the gas. The
volume  (V) of the gas increases  until the pressure  is again equal to the pressure  of the
surroundings.

Volumes  of Real Gases
You know that ideal gases have a volume  of 22.4 L at STP. Do real gases
have the same volume?  The volumes  of several  real gases at STP are given
in Table 12.1. All the volumes  are very close to 22.4 L/mol,  the molar
volume  of an ideal gas. Scientists  have decided  that 22.4 L/mol is an
acceptable  approximation  for any gas at STP when using gas laws.
Although  the volumes  are the same, one mole of a gas will have  a differ-
ent mass and density  than one mole of another  gas. (See Figure 12.7.)

A Deeper  Look: Real Gas Deviations
Do real gases always  behave  like ideal gases? At STP, you have seen
that most real gases behave  like ideal gases. At high pressures  and/or
low temperatures,  however,  gases no longer  behave  ideally.  To understand
why, recall the characteristics  of an ideal gas, according  to the kinetic
molecular  theory. (You learned  this in Chapter  11.)
e Gas molecules  have insignificant  volume  of their own.
e Molecules  have no attractive  forces between  each other or with their
container.
e Molecules  move in perfectly  straight  lines.
e Collisions  are completely  elastic and, thus, do not use up energy.
These characteristics  led to the ideal gas law. They are accurate  enough
for most applications.  They are not perfect,  however.  In fact, most gases
fall short of these characteristics  in many ways:
e The particles  of a real gas have a significant  volume  of their own.
e Molecules  do attract  each other.
e Molecules  do not necessarily  move in straight  lines.
e Collisions  are not completely  elastic.
At high pressures  and/or  low temperatures,  gases have smaller  volumes.
This means  that the gas molecules  are closer together.  Since they are
closer  together,  the molecules  interact  more than when they are far apart.
It is no longer  true to say that the molecules  have no attractive  forces
between  each other or with their container.  Part A of Figure 12.8 illus-
trates how this affects the pressure  of a gas. Also, since the total volume
is smaller,  the amount  of space taken up by the gas molecules  is more
important.  You can no longer  ignore  the volume  of the gas molecules.
Part B of Figure 12.8 illustrates  that gas molecules  do occupy  part of the
volume  of the container.
Scientists  who want more accuracy  in their experiments  have adapted
the ideal gas law to reflect  the behaviour  of real gases. In later chemistry
courses,  you will learn more about this corrected  version  of the ideal gas
law, called the Van der Waals equation.
To summarize,  at low pressures  and high temperatures,  most gases
behave  as ideal gases. Under  any conditions  that allow attractive  forces
between  molecules  to occur, gases no longer  behave  as an ideal gas. They
behave  as real gases.CHECKPOINT
Look back at Table 12.1. It
gives more accurate  molar vol-
umes for several gases. Using
what you have learned  about
the way real gases behave,
explain  why these molar
volumes  are slightly  different
from the molar volume  of an
ideal gas.
(A) Because  parti-
cles are attracted  to each other,
the pressure  is reduced.  (B) Since
particles  take up space,  the total
volume  of empty space is smaller
than the volume  of the container.

Lavoisier  (1743-1794),  was the

In the Sample  Problem  earlier,  you used three steps to find the molar
volume  of nitrogen  gas. After calculating  the number  of moles,  you
calculated  the final volume  using the combined  gas law. Then you used
Avogadro’s  law to find the volume  of one mole of nitrogen.  There is an
easier  way to do problems  like this—by  combining  the two gas laws.
After Avogadro’s  work, it did not take scientists  long to connect  V a n

As you know, all gases behave  in a similar  way. The universal  gas
constant  (R), which  applies  to all gases, was derived  for the final equation
given above. Examine  the calculation  below  to see how R was derived.

When it is measured  more accurately,  the universal  gas constant  (R)
has a value of 8.314 — This was the final piece of the equation.  The
resulting  equation  is an efficient  tool for solving  many problems  that
involve  gases.
The ideal gas law states that the pressure  multiplied  by the volume  is
equal to the number  of moles multiplied  by the universal  gas constant  and
the temperature.
PV = nRT
Guidelines  for Using the Ideal Gas Law
e Always  convert  the temperature  to kelvins  (K).
e Always  convert  the masses  to moles (mol).
e Always  convert  the volumes  to litres (L).
e Using the ideal gas law will be easier if you always  convert  the
pressures  to kilopascals  (kPa). Then you can memorize  the value
of R (8.314 wat) and use it for every calculation.  If you happen  to
forget the value of R, you can calculate  it by finding  R for 1 mol of
gas at STP.

As you breathe  in, your

your rib cage moves out to
increase  the volume  of your
lungs. As the volume increas-

lungs decreases.  Air from the
outside rushes in to fill the
expanded  volume.  This is an
application  of Boyle’s law. In
the same way, your lungs
decrease  in volume  when you

Mis referring  to.Density  and Molar Mass
As you learned  in the last section,  the molar  volume  of a gas is defined  as
the space that is occupied  by one mole of the gas. It is always  given in
units of L/mol.
The density  of a gas is similar  to the density  of a solid or a liquid.
Density  is found  by dividing  mass by volume.  The density  of a gas is
usually  reported  in units of g/L.
The molar  mass of a gas refers to the mass (in g) of one mole of the
gas. You can calculate  molar  mass by adding  the masses  of atoms in the
periodic  table. You can also calculate  molar  mass by dividing  the mass of
a sample  by the number  of moles that are present.  Molar  mass is always
expressed  in the units g/mol. Table 12.2 summarizes  molar  volume,
density,  and molar mass.

Molar volume (L/mol),  density

are closely  related.  You can

the other two. Analyze  the
units to discover the exact
relationship.Dense Gases Can Be Deadly
You have learned  that the volume  of a gas at a certain  temperature  and
pressure  is the same as the volume  of any other gas at the same tempera-
ture and pressure.  For example,  all gases have the approximate  volume
of 22.4 L at STP. The molecular  masses  of different  gases, however,  are all
different.  This means  that each gas has a different  density,  or mass per
unit of volume.  (Look  back at Figure 12.7 to see three examples.)
Understanding  the densities  of gases can be useful in the everyday
world. For example,  miners  who drill deep into the ground  must know
which  gases are present,  and which  have the highest  densities.  (See
Figure 12.10.) They must take appropriate  safety precau-
tions to avoid explosions,  poisoning,  or suffocation.
On December  3, 1984, an industrial  accident  in
Bhopal,  India, released  a large quantity  of methyliso-
cyanate,  CH3NCO,  a dense gas, into the air. This highly
irritating  and toxic gas caused  the death of more than
3000 people  living nearby.  The Chemistry  Bulletin  on
the next page gives an example  of a natural  disaster
involving  a dense gas. Figure 12.11, on page 492,
illustrates  a popular  use for gases that are less dense
than air.
GTIEEFAT)  Dense gases sit at the bottoms  of pits, such as
mines  and wells. Miners  must understand  the behaviour  of these
gases  to avoid accidents.  For example,  dense carbon  dioxide  gas
can cause suffocation.
490 MHR-* Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
Chemistry  Bulletin
On August  15, 1984, a cloud of deadly  gas
burst from Lake Monoun  in Cameroon,  a coun-
try in western  Africa.  Thirty-seven  people  died
from suffocation.  Two years later, on August
21, 1986, Lake Nyos, a larger and deeper  lake,
ejected  a full cubic kilometre  of the same gas.
The gas travelled  silently  into neighbouring  vil-
lages, killing  1700 people  and thousands  of
livestock.  What was this toxic gas?
Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun  both sit in
volcanic  craters.  The lakes are hazardous
because  of their volcanic  origin, even though
both volcanoes  are dormant.  Volcanoes  are
vents through  Earth’s  crust. They carry magma,
a mixture  of molten  rock and dissolved  gases,
to the surface  of Earth. When  magma  rises to
Earth’s  surface  in volcanoes,  the pressure  is
decreased.  The gases come out of solution  and
expand.
Magma  contains  a large quantity  of dis-
solved  carbon  dioxide  and minerals.  These are
released  from the magma  into the ground  water
under  a volcano’s  crater. Lake Nyos and Lake
Monoun  are both fed at the bottom  by volcanic
springs  of mineral-rich  carbonated  ground
water. In some crater lakes, there is enough
water circulation  for the carbon  dioxide  to bub-
ble up from the bottom  and be released  at the
surface.  The surface  waters of Lake Nyos and
Lake Monoun,  however,  do not mix with deep-
er waters.  The carbon  dioxide  remains  at the
bottom.  Volcanic  springs  continue  to supplythe lakes with carbon  dioxide,  which  remains
trapped  at the bottom.  Fresher  surface  water
sits on this dense lower layer.
Scientists  believe  that the tragedies  at Lake
Nyos and Lake Monoun  were caused  by  a dis-
ruption  of the water layers,  perhaps  triggered
by a landslide,  an earthquake,  or even a strong
wind. Lower  carbonated  water was suddenly
released  into the upper  water. As it moved  up
to the surface,  the pressure  on the gas
decreased  while the temperature  increased.  As
a result,  the carbon  dioxide  gas rapidly  bub-
bled out of solution.  At Lake Nyos, the sudden
release  of the lower lake water into the upper
layers caused  a plume of water and gas to rise
high into the air.
How did this massive  release  of carbon
dioxide  cause so many deaths?  Carbon  dioxide
gas is one-and-a-half  times as dense as air.
It sinks to the ground  and displaces  the oxy-
genated  air we need to breathe.  The invisible,
odourless  carbon  dioxide  that was released
from Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun  settled
on the ground.  It travelled  rapidly  down the
slopes into populated  regions.  People  quickly
became  unconscious  and died of suffocation.
Carbon  dioxide  continues  to accumulate  at
the bottoms  of both lakes. An international
team of scientists  is developing  a plan to
release  this carbon  dioxide  by controlled
degassing.  They plan to insert long pipes deep
into both lakes and suck up some of the dense
bottom  water. This will create a pressure  differ-
ence and cause a fountain  of gas-rich  water to
jet from the pipes.

In World War I, a highly
irritating  gas called phosgene,
COCl,, was used against  the
Allied troops. Phosgene  is
about 3.4 times more dense
than air. In concentrations
above 50 ppm, it causes  the
lungs to fill up with fluid. This
results in diminished  lung
Capacity,  and subsequent  col-
lapse of the heart. Phosgene
can bring about death within

gases.  These objects  are filled with gases  that are less dense  than air. Therefore,  they
are able to float.
In the following  Sample  Problem,  you will use the ideal gas law to find
the density  of nitrogen  gas.
Finding  the Density  of Nitrogen  Gas
Problem
Nitrogen  gas makes  up almost  80% of our atmosphere.  What is the
density  of pure nitrogen  gas, in g/L, at 12.50°C  and 126.63 kPa?
What Is Required?
Find the density  of nitrogen  gas, in g/L, at 12.50°C
and 126.63  kPa pressure.
What Is Given?
P = 126.63 kPa
T = 12.50°C
Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Change  the temperature  to kelvins.  The temperature  in this
question  is given to two decimal  places.  Therefore,  use a
conversion  factor with two decimal  places:  + 273.15.
Step 2 Calculate  the molar mass (M) of nitrogen  gas, Nz, using the
molar  mass in the periodic  table.
Step3 Since the volume  is not given, set it as 1.00 L. Since the
pressure  is given in kilopascals,  use R = 8.314 kPa-L/mol-K.
Substitute  the numbers  and units for P, T, R, and V into the
ideal gas law equation.  Solve for n.

Step5 The mass of 1.00 L of nitrogen  gas is 1.494 g. By dividing  this
by the volume,  1.00 L, we obtain  a density  of 1.494 g/L.

When the units cancel out in the ideal gas equation,  mol remains.
When units cancel in the density  equation,  g/L remain.

Step2 Solve the ideal gas law for the number  of moles.  First change

kilopascals  and use R = 8.314 kPa-L/mol-K.  (You could also
use R = 0.08206  atm-L/mol-K.)
Step3 Find the molar mass (M) of the compound  by dividing  the
mass of the sample  (m) by the number  of moles (n) in the
sample.
Step 4 Compare  the molar mass of the unknown  gas with the molar
mass of the empirical  formula.  To find the molecular  formula,
multiply  the empirical  formula  by the ratio of the two molar
masses.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 Find the empirical  formula.  Assume  that the total mass of the
sample  is 100.0 g. Thus the mass of the carbon  in the sample
is 80.0% x 100.0 g = 80.0 g. The mass of the hydrogen  is
20.0% x 100.0 g = 20.0.

the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

Step1 Write a balanced  equation  for the chemical  reaction.
Step 2 Find the number  of moles of iron present.  Use this value,
along with the mole ratios from the balanced  equation,  to
find the number  of moles of gas produced.
Step3 Use the ideal gas law. You know the number  of moles of gas,
the temperature,  and the pressure.  (Do not forget to change
the temperature  to kelvins.)  Solve for the volume  of the gas.

Step 2 Find the number  of moles of iron, and the number
of moles of gas.
To find the number  of moles of iron, divide the mass by
the molar mass. You can find the molar mass of iron in
the periodic  table: 55.85 g/mol. Note: If the reactant  was a
compound,  such as FeCl,, you would  need to calculate  the
molar mass by adding  the molar masses  of all the atoms.

Including  Water  Vapour  Pressure  in Gas Calculations
You can collect  many gases by allowing  them to bubble  up
through  water into a container  that is filled with water. (See
Figure 12.16).  This is the method  your teacher  used to collect
the gas in Investigation  12-A. Unfortunately,  molecules  of water
vapour  mix with the gas sample.  To avoid error, the pressure  that
was contributed  by the water vapour  must be subtracted  when
finding  the pressure  of the gas.
As an example,  consider  hydrogen  gas, which  is often
collected  over water. The hydrogen  that is collected  is a mixture
of hydrogen  and water vapour.  As you learned  from Dalton’s  law
of partial  pressures  in Chapter  11, the pressure  of this mixture  is
Protal = Phydrogen  + Pwater vapour
To find the partial  pressure  of dry hydrogen,  subtract  the pressure
of the water vapour  from the total pressure. GETIEEPATS  This is an
efficient  and convenient  methodPh drogen — Protal _ Pwater vapourees P for collecting  hydrogen  gas.
The pressure  of the water vapour  is the same for any gas that is collected Unfortunately  molecules  of water
at a particular  temperature.  For example,  the pressure  of water vapour  at vapour  mix with the gas sample.
25°C is 3.17 kPa. Table 12.3 gives the pressure  of water vapour  at different
temperatures.
When  using the ideal gas law for a gas collected  over water, you
must correct  the pressure  before you substitute  it into the gas law. The
following  Sample  Problem  shows you how to do this.

Step2 Calculate  the number  of moles of magnesium  by dividing  the
mass given (m) by the molar mass of magnesium  (M). Use the
number  of moles of magnesium,  along with the mole ratio

Using the Ideal Gas Law for the Gaseous  Reactant  of a Reaction
So far, you have used the ideal gas law for reactions  with a gas product.
You can also use the ideal gas law for reactions  with a gas as a reactant.
The following  Sample  Problem  shows you how to do this.
Space Shuttle  Science:  Gas as a Reactant
Problem
When astronauts  travel in a space shuttle
(Figure 12.17), carbon  dioxide  must be removed
from the air they breathe.  One method  is to bubble
the air in the shuttle  though  a solution  of lithium
hydroxide.  The lithium  hydroxide  converts  any
carbon  dioxide  into lithium  carbonate.
2LiOH (aq) + CO2(g) > LigCOs(aq)  + H20()
(You learned  about a different  method  in
Chapter  7 using solid LiOH.) Air containing  25.0 L
of carbon  dioxide  is passed  through  1.5 mol/L LiOH
solution  over a 20 min period. The atmospheric
pressure  in the shuttle  is 0.85 atm, and the
temperature  is 28.3°C. What mass of lithium
carbonate  is produced?
Note: Although  the air is bubbled  through  an
aqueous  solution,  you do not need to consider  the
pressure  of the water vapour.  This is because  you
are dealing  with the reactant  not the product.

a PRSEX
e Before  beginning  this investigation,  check  that
there are no open flames (such as lit Bunsen
burners)  in the laboratory.
e The acid that you are using in this investiga-
tion is strong enough  to burn. Wear your safety
glasses  and lab apron at all times. Handle  the
acid carefully.  Wipe up any spills of water or
acid immediately.  If you accidentally  spill any
acid on your skin, wash it off immediately  with
large amounts  of cool water.
e When  you have finished  the investigation,  you
can safely  wash the products  down the sink.
You must dilute them, however,  by running
water down afterward.

2. Obtain  a piece of magnesium  ribbon  that is
about 6 to 7 cm long. Use steel wool to clean
the outside  of the ribbon.  Measure  the mass
of the ribbon.
3. Use the mass of the magnesium  and the
balanced  equation  to predict  the volume  of
hydrogen  gas that will be produced.  Show
your calculations  in your notebook.
4. Fill the beaker  (or bowl) about half full of
water at room temperature.  Measure  the
temperature  of the water. (You will use this
temperature  to approximate  the temperature
of the gas produced.)
5. Measure  and record  the barometric  pressure.
6. Add 15 mL of water to the graduated  cylinder.
Then, very carefully,  pour 10 to 15 mL of
6 mol/L  HCl into the graduated  cylinder.
Very slowly  and carefully,  pour water at room
temperature  down the sides of the cylinder
until the cylinder  is completely  filled. Your
objective  in pouring  the water this way is to
avoid mixing  it with the acid at the bottom  of
the cylinder. Normally  you should
avoid adding  water to an acid. Be particularly
careful  during  this step.
7. Attach  the magnesium  ribbon  to the copper
wire. Dangle  the magnesium  in the graduated
cylinder.  The magnesium  should  hang 1 to
2 cm below  the stopper.  Put the stopper  in
the cylinder.  Do not worry if a small amount
of water overflows  out of the cylinder.
8. Hold your gloved  finger over the holes in the
stopper.  Tip the cylinder  upside  down into
the 1 L beaker.  Be careful  that no air bubblesget into the cylinder.  Hold or clamp the tube
into place. Watch  the reaction  proceed.
Record  your observations  in your notebook.
9. Add water, at room temperature,  to the beaker
until the level of the water inside  the cylinder
is exactly  the same as the level of the water in
the beaker.  This equalizes  the pressure  of the
hydrogen  gas with the air pressure  outside  the
tube. Note: Another  way to equalize  the pres-
sure is to raise the graduated  cylinder  slightly
to align the water levels.
10. Record  the volume  of the trapped  gas.
11. All the magnesium  should  be used up by the
reaction,  since it is the limiting  reagent.  If any
magnesium  ribbon  does remain  after the reac-
tion, rinse it with water, dry it with a paper
towel, and measure  its mass. To find the mass
of the magnesium  used up by the reaction,
subtract  the final mass from the initial mass.
12. Empty  and clean all your apparatus.  Clean
your work space. Wash your hands.
Analysis
1. Calculate  the molar volume  of hydrogen.  Use
the volume  of the Hz gas, and the water tem-
perature.  Also, use the barometric  pressure
minus  the pressure  of the water vapour.
2. Use the combined  or ideal gas law to translate
the conditions  to STP. Redo the calculations.

ume of dry hydrogen  gas at STP? How close

radiation  from the Sun. The radiation  separates  the ozone into oxygen  gas,
O,, and an oxygen  atom. After passing  through  a few more steps, ozone
is re-formed  when molecules  of oxygen  gas combine  with oxygen  atoms.
By absorbing  energy  from the Sun in this way, ozone prevents  harmful
UV radiation  from reaching  Earth’s  surface.  Figure 12.19 illustrates  the
cycle that occurs  as ozone is formed,  absorbs  UV radiation,  and breaks  up.
Figure 12.20 shows  where ozone is located  in the atmosphere.Altitude (k

GEMISEEAEY  The ozone cycle: (A) Oxygen gas in the atmosphere  absorbs  energy  from
the Sun. Each oxygen  molecule  breaks up into two oxygen  atoms. (B) An oxygen  atom
combines  with a molecule  of oxygen  gas to form ozone. Another  molecule  is needed  to
absorb extra energy.  (C) Ozone absorbs  ultraviolet  radiation  and breaks up again into
oxygen  gas and an oxygen  atom.
Pollutants  in the Atmosphere
Gases from living and non-living  processes  on Earth’s  surface  interact
with the gases in the atmosphere.  For example,  oxygen  and carbon  diox-
ide in the air are involved  in animal  and plant respiration.  A forest fire
burns plants to produce  carbon  dioxide  gas. On a more damaging  level,
human  technology  and industrial  processes  produce  many polluting
gases. As you will learn in Chapter  14, burning  fossil fuels is a major
source of gas pollution  in the atmosphere.
Chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) are an important  class of polluting  gases
that are not usually  caused  by burning  fossil fuels. CFCs are stable and
harmless  near the ground.  When  they make their way up into the atmos-
phere, however,  they interact  and interfere  with atmospheric  processes.  In
particular,  these gases interfere  with the production  and reactions  of
ozone,  O03. You will learn more about CFCs later in this section.

pollutants.(See Figure 12.21.)
516 MHR-« Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
At this level, ozone is a pollutant  with a harsh odour. In humans  and
animals,  it causes  respiratory  problems,  including  coughing,  wheezing,
and eye irritation.  It retards  plant growth,  reduces  the productivity  of
crops, and damages  forests.  Concentrations  of ozone as low as 0.1 ppm
(parts per million)  can decrease  photosynthesis  by 50%. In addition,  it
damages  plastics,  breaks down rubber,  and corrodes  metals.
Environmental  Technician
Gases in the atmosphere  (such as carbon
dioxide  and methane)  allow heat from the Sun
to enter the atmosphere  and prevent  it from
leaving  again. This is called the greenhouse
effect. Thanks  to the greenhouse  effect, Earth
remains  fairly warm,  with an average  tempera-
ture of about 15.5°C.  Without  this effect, Earth’s
temperature  would be about —18°C.
Human  activities  over the last hundred
years have caused  the level of carbon  dioxide
and other gases in the atmosphere  to increase.
As a result, more heat is trapped  in Earth’s
atmosphere.  According  to Environment  Canada,
Canada’s  average  temperature  has risen by about
1°C over the last century.  This is causing  more
frequent  and more intense  winter  storms.
Change  from the Ground Up
How can we decrease  the production  of green-
house gases?  One way is to focus on the sources
of these gases. As global warming  increases,
chemists  who study atmospheric  processes  will
be more in demand.
Change  begins  with accurate  measurements.
Environmental  technicians  assess  and monitor
pollution  levels in air, water, and soil. To become
an environmental  technician,  you need a high
school diploma,  with advanced-level  credits  in
CFCs and Ozone Depletionmathematics,  English,  and science  (preferably
chemistry  or physics).  You also need a two- or
three-year  community  college  program  in
environmental  technology.
Environmental  technicians  gather  gas samples  from
smokestacks  and PCBs from transformers.  They also set
up equipment  in the field to create baseline  studies  and
monitor  changes  in the environment.
Make Career  Connections
Human  Resource  Development  Canada  has
offices  in every province.  It also has a web
site where  you can access  descriptions  and
requirements  for many careers,  including
that of environmental  technician.  What other
environmental  career  opportunities  can you
locate?  Prepare  a brief report of your findings,
and present  it to the class.
As you learned  earlier,  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) are chemicals  that
interfere  with the ozone cycle high up in the atmosphere.  CFCs are non-
toxic, nonflammable  compounds  that contain  atoms of chlorine,  carbon,
and fluorine.  These gases are human-made  compounds  that were released
into the atmosphere  primarily  from refrigeration  and aerosol  devices.
In 1928, Thomas  Midgley  invented  the first CFC compound.  Because
they were useful but safe, they were referred  to as “miracle  compounds.”
In particular,  dichlorodifluoromethane,  CCl,.F2,  also known  as Freon, was
discovered  to be an efficient  refrigerant.
Chapter  12 Exploring  Gas Laws» MHR_ 517
Because  of Freon,  household  refrigeration  became  common.  In fact, much
of our modern-day  life style first became  possible  because  of CFCs.
By 1974, millions  of tonnes  of CFCs had been produced  (see Figure 12.22).
At the University  of California,  chemists  F. Sherwood  Rowland  and Mario
Molina  began  to wonder  where all of these CFCs ended  up. They realized
that CFCs are chemically  very stable. However,  they began  to calculate
what happens  when CFCs are exposed  to high levels of radiation  far up in
the atmosphere.  As it turned  out, their fears were well-founded.  In 1985,
British  scientists  in the Antarctic  noticed  a large decrease  in the ozone
layer above the Antarctic.  A “hole” in the ozone layer was beginning  to
form. In 1995, Rowland  and Molina,  along with a third ozone scientist,
won the Nobel Prize for their work with CFCs.
How CFCs Attack  Ozone

GETIEREZ=]  The breakdown  of a CFC by ultraviolet  radiation  produces  single chlorine
atoms  that attack  and destroy  ozone. Because  the chlorine  atoms are released,  they
attack ozone again and again in a chain reaction.
Although  they are the most abundant  ozone-depleting  substance,  CFCs
are not the only culprits.  Other chemicals  that damage  the ozone layer
include  methyl  bromide,  CH3Br,  carbon  tetrachloride,  CCl,, and halons
such as carbon  trifluorobromide,  CF3Br.
518 MHR- Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  Chemistry
The Effects  of Ozone  Depletion
How do we know that CFCs and other ozone-destroying
molecules  are having  an effect on the atmosphere?  As
Figure 12.24 illustrates,  ozone levels over Canada  and
other parts of the world have decreased  significantly
since the late 1970s.
With reduced  ozone levels, more ultraviolet
radiation  from the Sun reaches  Earth. Among
humans,  UV-induced  skin cancer  and eye damage
are becoming  a serious  threat. The increased  levels
of radiation  also damage  phytoplankton  in fresh
and marine  ecosystems.  Since phytoplankton  are
the base of the aquatic  food chain, this damage
affects  all other water species.  As you learned
earlier,  the presence  of ozone close to Earth damages
crops and forests.  A lack of ozone in the atmosphere,
however,  also reduces  the yield of crops, such as barley
and canola,  and harms forests.

Much of the positive  activity  comes from an international  agreement
called the Montréal  Protocol.  This agreement  was signed  in Montréal,
Canada,  on September  16, 1987. It has been successful  in drastically
reducing  the use of CFCs worldwide.  The Montréal  Protocol  is particular-
ly significant  because,  for the first time, individual  countries  put a
common  planetary  goal ahead of their own economic  interests.
The Montréal  Protocol stated that the production  and consumption ud

524An Issue to
The Costs of
Getting  Around
Many people  blame the government  for not enforcing
sufficient  regulations  to protect  and clean up the envi-
ronment.  New, cleaner  technologies  have been devel-
oped by science.  Why don’t we use them? The fact is,
Canadians  are accustomed  to a comfortable  lifestyle,
and may not be willing  to change  it. How would  you
feel about stricter  government  regulations  that affected
your transportation  and recreation?
#
Background
People  have always  turned  to the cheapest  and
most efficient  technologies.  In the last few centuries,
fossil fuels such as coal and oil were discovered  in
large amounts.  These fuels were also very efficient,
producing  large amounts  of energy.  It is only recently
that we have become  aware of the environmental
consequences  of our use of fossil fuels.
Today,  we are attempting  to reduce  environmental
harm. Coal- and oil-burning  engines  have been
replaced  by cleaner  gas-burning  engines.  Many engines
are equipped  with “scrubbers”  that help remove  toxins
before  releasing  gases into the atmosphere.  Most envi-
ronmental  problems  have not been solved,  however.
Automobile  emissions  are one of our most serious
environmental  problems  today.
Automobiles  expel an enormous  amount  of
toxins into the air every day. Besides  harming  the
environment,  these toxins are also dangerous  to
MHR * Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric  ChemistryAnalyze
human  health.  It is estimated  that many cases of bron-
chitis, asthma,  and even early death could be eliminat-
ed, by removing  sulfur from fossil fuels before  burning
them. This process  is possible,  but it costs money.
Ultimately,  these additional  costs would  be paid by
the consumer—  you!
Often, Canadians  do not appreciate  or approve  of
government  efforts  to reduce  automobile  emissions.
Some people  were angry when, decades  ago, the gov-
ernment  asked them to switch  to unleaded  gasoline.
Even now, many people  remove  factory-installed,
pollution-reducing  resonators  and catalytic  converters
from their new cars. They do this in an effort to
increase  the power  of their vehicles.
Environment  Canada  has copious  amounts  of
research  suggesting  that reducing  automobile  emis-
sions would  improve  the health of Canadians.  The
restrictions  that would  make these improvements,
however,  have not yet been enforced.  For example,
motorboats  can be equipped  with motors  that are near-
ly silent and that do not dump oil into the water.
Because  these cleaner,  quieter  motors  are more expen-
sive, most boaters  still use the old cheaper  motors.
To what extent should  individuals  be allowed
to make such choices?  Should  the good of the
community  and the overall  environment  have a higher
priority  than personal  choice?
Plan and Present
As a class, you will debate  the following  proposal:
All vehicles  must meet strict environmentally-
friendly  emissions  standards.  Any vehicles,  new or
old, that do not meet these standards  must not be used
until they are upgraded  to the new emission  stan-
dards. Individual  owners  must pay for this upgrading.
Those  individuals  who cannot  afford to upgrade  their
vehicles  will be obliged  to rely on public  transportation.
There are many angles to this issue. You may wish
to consider  motorboat  engines,  private  vehicles,  com-
mercial  vehicles  such as transport  trucks,  and the
development  and availability  of public  transportation.
@ Before starting  your research,  make a journal entry
describing  what you think of the proposal.
@® Look at the people listed below. How would each
person  react to the proposal?  Why? For each
person,  write two comments  expressing  that
person’s  point of view.
(a) someone  your age who lives in a rural area
where  there is no public  transportation  at all
(b) someone  your age who lives downtown  in a city
with excellent  public  transportation
(c) a commercial  truck driver  who uses thousands  of
litres of fuel each week
(d) a used-car  salesperson
(e) an autoworker
) Write a counterpoint  or amendment  to the
resolution  in order to respond  to each of the
comments  in your answer  to question  2.
a Research  the facts behind this situation.  Before you
start, brainstorm  some specific  questions  to
research.  Some suggestions  are given below.

Look ahead to the end-of-unit
project,  “Consumer  Chemistry.”
Start thinking  now about  the
consumer  item that you would like
to investigate.  As you study this
unit, plan how you will investigate
the chemical  nature of the product
you have chosen.Think of what the world must have
been like 560 million  years ago.
Temperatures  were much warmer
than they are now. Lush green
vegetation  covered  much of the
North American  landscape.  Through
photosynthesis,  these ancient  plants
(like plants  today) stored energy
from the Sun as food. Abundant
marine  life filled the oceans.  Other
animals  thrived  on the land.
Humans  did not yet exist.
Today our society  relies heavily
on the remains  of ancient  forests
and long-dead  marine  life. From
these remains,  we manufacture
products  such as the gasoline  that
fuels cars and the plastic  wrap
that covers  the sandwich  in your
lunch. How does this incredible
transformation  take place?
In this unit, you will learn about
fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are carbon
compounds  that have been produced
over millions  of years from the
remains  of ancient  living things.
You will examine  the structures
and properties  of many hydrocarbon
compounds  that we obtain  from
fossil fuels. As well, you will find
out how these compounds  can be
refined  to produce  many useful
materials.
Later in this unit, you will
discover  how modern  society
obtains  energy  from hydrocarbons.
The Chemistry
of Hydrocarbons
D:. you know that you have bark from a willow tree in your medicine
cabinet  at home?  The model  at the bottom  right of the opposite  page
shows a compound  that is found naturally  in willow  bark. This chemical
is called salicin.  It is a source of pain relief for moose,  deer, and other
animals  that chew the bark. For thousands  of years, Aboriginal  people  in
Canada  and around  the world have relied on salicin’s  properties  for the
same pain-relieving  purpose.
The model at the bottom  left of the opposite  page shows a close
relative  of salicin.  Scientists  made, or synthesized,  this chemical  near the
end of the nineteenth  century.  It is called acetyl salicylic  acid (ASA).  You
probably  know it better  by its brand name, AspirinTM.
Chemists  refer to salicin,  ASA, and more than ten million  other
chemicals  like them as organic  compounds.  An organic  compound  is a
molecular  compound  of carbon.  Despite  the tremendous  diversity  of
organic  compounds,  nearly  all of them share something  in common.  They
are structured  from a “backbone”  that consists  of just two kinds of atoms:
carbon  and hydrogen.
Compounds  that are formed  from carbon  and hydrogen  are called
hydrocarbons.  In this chapter,  you will explore  the sources,  structures,
properties,  and uses of hydrocarbons—an  enormous  class of compounds.
As well, you will learn how scientists  and engineers  use the properties
of hydrocarbons  to produce  a seemingly  infinite  variety  of chemicals
and products.
How can just two
elements,  carbon
and hydrogen,
account  for 90% of
all the biological
matter  on Earth?Chapter  Preview

Cyanides  (containing  carbon
bonded  to nitrogen,  CN) and
carbides,  (such as calcium
carbide,  CaC2) are compounds
that contain  carbon,  but
scientists  classify  them as
inorganic.  The same is true of
carbonates,  such as sodium
hydrogen  carbonate,  NaHCO;
(baking soda). Why are car-
bonate compounds  inorganic,
rather than organic,
compounds?

Acetylsalicylic  acid (ASA) was
first produced  commercially
under the brand name
AspirinTM  by Frederick  Bayer
and Company  in 1897. The
word “aspirin”  comes  from
“a,” for acetyl, and “spir,” for
spirea. Spirea is a genus of
plants that is another  natural
source of salicylic  acid.Introducing  Organic  Compounds
As stated in the chapter  opener,  an organic  compound  is a molecular  com-
pound of carbon.  There are a few exceptions  to this definition,  however.
For example,  scientists  classify  oxides of carbon,  such as carbon  dioxide
and carbon  monoxide,  as inorganic.  However,  the vast majority  of carbon-
containing  compounds  are organic.
Organic  Compounds:  Natural  and Synthetic
Organic  compounds  abound  in the natural  world. In fact, you probably  ate
sugar or starch at your last meal. Sugars,  starches,  and other carbohydrates
are natural  organic  compounds.  So are fats, proteins,  and the enzymes
that help you digest  your food. Do you wear clothing  made from wool,
silk, or cotton?  These are natural  organic  compounds,  too. So are the
molecules  of DNA in the nuclei  of your cells.
Until 1828, the only organic  compounds  on Earth were those that
occur naturally.  In that year, a German  chemist  named  Friedrich  Wohler
synthesized  urea—an  organic  compound  found in mammal  urine—from
an inorganic  compound,  ammonium  cyanate.  (See Figure 13.1.) This was
a startling  achievement.  Until then, chemists  had assumed  that only living
or once-living  organisms  could be the source of organic  compounds.  They
believed  that living matter  had an invisible  “vital force.”  According  to
these early chemists,  this vital (life) force made organic  matter  fundamen-
tally different  from inorganic  (non-living)  matter.
Urea
(GGEEISRESS  When Friedrich  Wohler  (1800-1882)  synthesized  urea, he wrote  a letter
to his teacher.  In his letter, he said, “! must tell you that | can make urea without  the
use of kidneys...Ammonium  cyanate  is urea.” About 20 years earlier,  Wohler's  teacher,
Jons Jakob Berzelius  (1779-1848),  had invented  the system  that distinguishes  organic
substances  from inorganic  substances.
534. MHR-« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
During  the mid-1850s,  chemists  synthesized  other organic
compounds,  such as methane  and ethanol,  from inorganic  chemicals.
Eventually  chemists  abandoned  their vital-force  ideas. We still use the
terms “organic”  and “inorganic,”  however,  to distinguish  carbon-based
compounds  from other compounds.  For example,  sugar is an organic
compound  since it is carbon  based. Salt is inorganic  since it contains
no carbon.
During  the last century,  the number  of synthetic  (human-made)
organic  compounds  has skyrocketed.  Chemists  invent  more than 250 000
new synthetic  organic  chemicals  each year. With almost  endless  varia-
tions in properties,  chemists  can synthesize  organic  compounds  to make
products  as diverse  as life-giving  drugs, and toys. Nearly  all medicines,
such as painkillers,  cough syrups,  and antidepressants,  are based on
organic  compounds.  Perfumes,  food flavourings,  materials  such as rubber
and plastic,  and fabrics such as nylon, rayon, and polyester  are all organic
compounds  as well.

Why does society  depend  on
fossil fuels? What are they

Challenge  at the end of this
book, you will investigate  a
different  type of fossil fuel
from an imaginary  planet.The Origins  of Hydrocarbons  and Other Organic  Compounds
Most hydrocarbons  and other organic  compounds  have their origins  deep
below Earth’s  present  surface.  In the past, as now, photosynthetic  organ-
isms used energy  from the Sun to convert  carbon  dioxide  and water into
oxygen  and carbohydrates,  such as sugars,  starches,  and cellulose.  When
these organisms  died, they settled  to the bottom  of lakes, rivers, and ocean
beds, along with other organic  matter.  Bacterial  activity  removed  most of
the oxygen  and nitrogen  from the organic  matter,  leaving  behind  mainly
hydrogen  and carbon.
Over time, the organic  matter  was covered  with layers of mud and
sediments.  As layer upon layer built up, heat and tremendous  pressure
transformed  the sediments  into shale and the organic  matter  into solid,
liquid,  and gaseous  materials.  These materials  are the fossil fuels—coal,
oil, and natural  gas—that  society  depends  on today. (See Figure 13.2.)

Dr. Raymond  Lemieux
Raymond  Lemieux  was born into a carpenter’s
family in 1920 at Lac La Biche, Alberta.  He
obtained  a B.Sc. degree  at the University  of
Alberta  and a Ph.D. at McGill University  in
Montréal.  Lemieux  then worked  briefly  at Ohio
State University,  where he met Dr. Virginia
McConaghie.  They were married  and soon moved
to Saskatoon,  Saskatchewan.  There Lemieux
became  a senior researcher  at a National
Research  Council  (NRC) laboratory.
Raymond  Lemieux  (1920-2000)
In 1953, while at the NRC lab, Lemieux  conquered
what some have called “the Mount  Everest  of
organic  chemistry.”  He became  the first person
to completely  synthesize  sucrose,  or table sugar.
Sucrose  is a carbohydrate  with the chemical  for-
mula C42H22011.  It is the main sugar in the sap of
536 MHR-« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energyplants such as sugar beets and sugar cane.
Sucrose  is related  to glucose,  CgH120.¢,  and
other sugars.
Lemieux  continued  his research  at the
University  of Ottawa,  and then at the University
of Alberta  in Edmonton.  He was especially  inter-
ested in how molecules  “recognize”  each other
and interact  in the human  body. For example,
different  blood groups,  such as group A and
group B, are determined  by carbohydrate  mole-
cules that differ by only a single sugar. The body
is able to recognize  these specific  sugars  and
adapt its response  to foreign  substances,  such
as bacteria  and transplanted  organs.
Since it was hard to obtain natural  samples  of
the body sugars  that Lemieux  wanted  to study, he
found ways to synthesize  them. This was ground-
breaking  research.  Seeing  the practical  applica-
tions of his research,  Lemieux  was instrumental
in starting  several  chemical  companies.  Today
these companies  make products  such as antibi-
otics, blood-group  determinants,  and immunizing
agents  that are specific  to various  human  blood
groups.  They also make complex  carbohydrates
that absorb  antibodies  from the blood in order
to prevent  organ transplant  rejection.
Lemieux  and his wife had six children  and a
number  of grandchildren.  With all that he had
accomplished  in life, Lemieux  said, “My proudest
achievement  is my family.”  His autobiography,
titled Explorations  with Sugar:  How Sweet  It Was,
was published  in 1990.
Origin of Fossil Fuels
Coal is formed  mainly  from
the remains  of land-based
plants.Petroleum  (crude oil) is
formed  mainly  from the
remains  of marine-based
microscopic  plants,
plant-like  organisms,  and
animal-like  organisms.Natural  gas may form
under the same conditions
as petroleum.
GPT  Ancient  eras that had higher carbon dioxide  concentrations,  as well as
warmer  climates,  gave rise to abundant  plant and animal life on land and under water.
Over time, as these organisms  died, the organic  substances  that made up their bodies
were chemically  transformed  into the materials  known  today as fossil fuels.
Sources  of Hydrocarbons
Sources  of hydrocarbons  include  wood, the products  that result from
the fermentation  of plants,  and fossil fuels. However,  one fossil fuel—
petroleum—is  the main source of the hydrocarbons  that are used for
fuels and many other products,  such as plastics  and synthetic  fabrics.
Petroleum,  sometimes  referred  to as crude oil, is a complex  mixture
of solid, liquid, and gaseous  hydrocarbons.  To understand  the importance
of petroleum  in our society,  you need to become  better acquainted  with
hydrocarbons.  Your introduction  begins,  in the next section,  with
carbon—one  of the most versatile  elements  on Earth.

Representing  Structures  and Bonding
You have written  chemical  formulas  for inorganic  compounds  such as
ammonia,  NH3, and calcium  carbonate,  CaCO3.  As well, you have
represented  these compounds  using Lewis diagrams,  and perhaps  other
models.  Such compounds  are fairly small, so they are easy to represent
using these methods.  Many organic  compounds—such  as methane,  CH4,
and ethanol,  C,H,0—are  also fairly small. With patience,  you might even
figure out how to draw a Lewis diagram  for cholesterol,  C27H4g0!  Most
hydrocarbons  and other organic  compounds  are quite large, however.
They are also structurally  complex.  Therefore  chemists  have devised  other
methods  to represent  them, as explained  below.
Using Expanded  Molecular  Formulas  to Represent  Hydrocarbons
One method  that chemists  use to represent  a large molecule  is the
expanded  molecular  formula.  This type of formula  shows the groupings
of atoms, and it often gives an idea of molecular  structure.  For example,
the chemical  formula  for propane  is C3Hg. This formula  tells you that
propane  contains  three carbon  atoms and eight hydrogen  atoms. It gives
no clue, though,  about the way in which the atoms are bonded  together.
Propane’s  expanded  molecular  formula  is CH3;CH,CH3.  As you can see
from this formula,  the expanded  molecular  formula  gives a clearer  idea of
atomic arrangement.  It implies  that a CH; group is attached  to a CH
group, which is attached  to another  CH3 group.
Writing  expanded  molecular  formulas  becomes  more helpful  when
you are dealing  with larger hydrocarbons.  For example,  CgH;, is a
component  of gasoline.  It is also used as a solvent  for extracting  oils
from soybeans  and other edible oil seeds. Depending  on how the carbon
and hydrogen  atoms are bonded  together,  CsH;4 can have any of the five
structural  arrangements  shown  in Figure 13.5. Each arrangement  has a
different  name.Graph the data in the table
below. Note: Bond energy  is
the amount  of energy  that is
needed  to break a chemical

A structural  diagram  is a two-dimensional  representation  of the structure

called structural  formulas.)  There are three kinds of structural  diagrams:
complete  structural  diagrams,  condensed  structural  diagrams,  and line
structural  diagrams.  As you can see in Figure 13.8, each serves a specific
purpose  in describing  the structure  of a compound.

The name “aliphatic”
comes  from the Greek word
aleiphatos,  meaning  “fat.”
Early chemists  found these
compounds  to be less dense
than water and insoluble  in
water, like fats. “Aliphatic”
now refers to the classes  of
hydrocarbons  called alkanes,
alkenes,  and alkynes.Classifying  Hydrocarbons
Chemists  group hydrocarbons  and other organic  compounds  into the
categories  shown  in Figure 13.10. The International  Union  of Pure and
Applied  Chemistry  (IUPAC)  has developed  a comprehensive  set of rules
for naming  the compounds  within  each category.  Using these rules, you
will be able to classify  and name all the hydrocarbon  compounds  that you
will encounter  in this unit.
The names  that are based on the IUPAC  rules are called systematic
names.  During  your study of organic  chemistry,  you will also run across
many common  names  for organic  compounds.  For example,  the system-
atic name for the organic  acid CH3;CO2H  is ethanoic  acid. You are probably
more familiar  with its common  name: vinegar.

GFTISEERTY  This concept  map illustrates  a system  for classifying  organic  compounds.
In this chapter,  you will explore  only part of the family  of organic  compounds—the
aliphatic  hydrocarbons  shown by the boldface  type.
Alkanes
Alkanes  are hydrocarbon  molecules  that are joined  by single covalent
bonds. They are the simplest  hydrocarbons.  Methane,  CHg4, is the simplest
alkane.  It is the main component  of natural  gas. Alkanes  are aliphatic
hydrocarbons:  organic  compounds  in which  carbon  atoms form chains
and non-aromatic  rings.
Figure 13.11 on the next page compares  the structural  formulas  of
methane  and the next three members  of the alkane  family.  Notice  three
facts about these alkanes:
1. Each carbon  atom is bonded  to the maximum  possible  number  of
atoms (either  carbon  or hydrogen  atoms).  As a result, chemists  refer to

2. Each molecule  differs  from the next molecule  by the structural  unit
—CH>2-.  A series of molecules  like this, in which  each member  increases
by the same structural  unit, is called a homologous  series.
3. A mathematical  pattern  underlies  the number  of carbon  and hydrogen
atoms in each alkane.  All alkanes  have the general  formula  C,Ho2n+2,
where  n is the number  of carbon  atoms. For example,  propane  has
3 carbon  atoms. Using the general  formula,  we find that
2n+2=2(3)+2=8
Thus propane  should  have the formula  C3Hg, which  it does.

Properties  of Alkanes
Alkanes  (and all other aliphatic  compounds)  have an important  physical
property.  They are non-polar.  As you know from Chapter  8, non-polar
molecules  have fairly weak intermolecular  forces.  As a result,  hydrocar-
bons such as alkanes  have relatively  low boiling  points.  As the number
of atoms in the hydrocarbon  molecule  increases,  the boiling  point
increases.  Because  of this, alkanes  exist in a range of states under
standard  conditions.\N y,CHECKPOINT

Naming  Alkanes
The IUPAC  system  for naming  organic  compounds  is very logical  and
thorough.  The rules for naming  alkanes  are the basis for naming  the other
organic  compounds  that you will study. Therefore  it is important  that you
understand  how to name alkanes.
Naming  Straight-Chain  Alkanes
Recall that carbon  can bond to form long, continuous,  chain-like  struc-
tures. Alkanes  that bond in this way are called straight-chain  alkanes.
(They are also called unbranched  alkanes.)  Straight-chain  alkanes  are
the simplest  alkanes.  Table 13.2 lists the names  of the first ten straight-
chain alkanes.
Table 13.2 The First Ten Straight-Chain  Alkanes

The root of each name (highlighted  in colour)  serves an important
function.  It tells you the number  of carbon  atoms in the chain. The
suffix -ane tells you that these compounds  are alkane  hydrocarbons.
Thus the root and the suffix of one of these simple  names  provide  the
complete  structural  story of the compound.
546 MHR-» Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
Naming  Branched-Chain  Alkanes
The naming  rules for straight-chain  alkanes  can, with a few additions,
help you recognize  and name other organic  compounds.  You now know
that the name of a straight-chain  alkane  is composed  of a root (such as
meth-) plus a suffix (-ane). Earlier  in the chapter,  you saw the isomers  of
CgHi4. Figure 13.13 shows one of them, called 2-methylpentane.
CH CH;
| Figure 13.13  | 2-methylpentane
Notice  four important  facts about 2-methylpentane:
1. Its structure  is different  from the structure  of a straight-chain  alkane.
Like many hydrocarbons,  this isomer  of CgH,,4 has a branch-like
structure.  Alkanes  such as 2-methylpentane  are called branched-chain
alkanes.  (The branch  is sometimes  called a side-chain.)
2. The name of this alkane  has a prefix (2-methyl-)  as well as a root
and a suffix. Many of the hydrocarbons  you will name from now on
have a prefix.
3. This alkane  has a single CH3 unit that branches  off from the main
(parent)  chain of the compound.
4. There is another  CH; unit bonded  to a CH, unit at the right end of the
chain. This is not another  branch.  It is a bend in the parent  chain.
Before continuing,  refer to the ChemFact  on page 543. Make sure that
you understand  why the CH; unit is not another  branch.
Rules for Naming  Alkanes
The names  of branched-chain  alkanes  (and most other aliphatic  com-
pounds)  have the same general  format,  as shown  in Figure 13.14. This
format  will become  clearer  as you learn and practise  the rules for naming
hydrocarbons.  To start, read the steps on the next page to see how
2-methylpentane  gets its name.
2-methylpentane  is a simple  example  of a branched  hydrocarbon.
Later you will see more complicated  examples.CHECKP@INT
The root and the suffix of an
alkane name do not tell you
directly  about  the number  of

Drawing  Alkanes
As you learned  earlier  in this chapter,  three kinds of diagrams  can be used
to represent  the structure  of a hydrocarbon.  The easiest  kind is probably
the condensed  structural  diagram.  When you are asked to draw a con-
densed  structural  diagram  for an alkane,  such as 2,3-dimethylhexane,
you can follow  several  simple  rules. These rules are listed below. After
you have studied  the rules, use the Practice  Problems  to practise  your
alkane-drawing  skills.
Rules for Drawing  Condensed  Structural  Diagrams
1. Identify  the root and the suffix of the name. In 2,3-dimethylhexane,
for example,  the root and suffix are -hexane.  The -hex- tells you that
there are six carbons  in the main chain. The -ane tells you that the
compound  is an alkane.  Therefore  this compound  has single carbon-
carbon  bonds only.
2. Draw the main chain first. Draw it straight,  to avoid mistakes  caused
by a fancy shape. Do not include  any hydrogen  atoms. You will need
to add branches  before you finalize  the number  of hydrogen  atoms on
each carbon.  Leave space beside each carbon  on the main chain to
write the number  of hydrogen  atoms later.
Cc —c —Cc —C —C —C
3. Choose  one end of your carbon  chain to be carbon  number  1. Then
locate the carbon  atoms to which  the branches  must be added. Add
the appropriate  number  and size of branches,  according  to the prefix in
the name of the compound.  In this example,  2,3-dimethyl  tells you that
there is one methyl  (single carbon-containing)  branch  on the second
550 9 MHR« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
carbon  of the main chain, and another  methyl!  branch  on the third
carbon  of the main chain. It does not matter  whether  you place both
branches  above the main chain, both below, or one above and one
below. The compound  will still be the same.

Cc —Cc —C —C —C —C

4. Finish  drawing  your diagram  by adding  the appropriate  number  of
hydrogen  atoms beside each carbon.  Remember  that each carbon  has a
valence  of four. So if a carbon  atom has one other carbon  atom bonded
to it, you need to add three hydrogen  atoms.  If a carbon  atom has two
other carbon  atoms bonded  to it, you need to add two hydrogen  atomso
and so on.

Alkenes
Did you know that bananas  are green when they are picked?  How do they
become  yellow  and sweet  by the time they reach your grocer’s  produce
shelf or your kitchen?  Food retailers  rely on a hydrocarbon  to make the
transformation  from bitter green fruit to delicious  ripe fruit. The hydrocar-
bon is ethene.  It is the simplest  member  of the second  group of aliphatic
compounds:  the alkenes.
Alkenes  are hydrocarbons  that contain  one or more double  bonds.
Like alkanes,  alkenes  can form continuous  chain and branched-chain
structures.  They also form a homologous  series. As well, they are non-
polar, which  gives them physical  properties  similar  to those of alkanes.
Alkenes  are different  from alkanes,  however,  in a number  of ways.
First, their bonds are different,  as indicated  by their suffixes.  As you
will recall, the -ane ending  tells you that alkane compounds  are joined  by
single bonds. The -ene ending  for alkenes  tells you that these compounds
have one or more double  bonds.  A double  bond involves  four bonding
electrons  between  two carbon  atoms, instead  of the two bonding  electrons
in all alkane  bonds.  Examine  Figure 13.18 to see how the presence  of a
double  bond affects  the number  of hydrogen  atoms in an alkene.

552 MHR« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
The general  formula  for an alkene  is C,H2,. You can check  this against
the next two members  of the alkene  series. Propene  has three carbon
atoms, so you would expect  it to have six hydrogens.  Butene  has four car-
bon atoms, so it should  have eight hydrogens.  The formulas  for propene
and butene  are C3Hg and C4Hs, so the general  formula  is accurate.  Note,
however,  that the general  formula  applies  only if there is one double  bond
per molecule.  You will learn about alkenes  with multiple  double  bonds in
future chemistry  courses.
Properties  of Alkenes
The general  formula  for alkenes  implies  that at least two carbon  atoms
in any alkene compound  have fewer than four bonded  atoms.  As a result,
chemists  refer to alkenes  as unsaturated  compounds.  Unlike  saturated
compounds,  unsaturated  hydrocarbons  contain  carbon  atoms that can
potentially  bond to additional  atoms.
Unsaturated  compounds  have physical  and chemical  properties  that
differ from those of saturated  compounds.  For example,  the boiling  points
of alkenes  are usually  slightly  less than the boiling  points of similar-sized
alkanes  (alkanes  with the same number  of carbon  atoms).  This difference
reflects  the fact that the forces between  molecules  are slightly  less for
alkenes  than for alkanes.  For example,  the boiling  point of ethane  is
—89°C,  whereas  the boiling  point of ethene  is —104°C.  On the other hand,
both alkenes  and alkanes  have a low solubility  in water. Alkenes,  like all
aliphatic  compounds,  are non-polar.= -,

food pouches,  milk bottles,  motor oil bottles,  many toys, shrink-wrap,  and
plastic  bags are all based on the small ethene  molecule.  (See Figure 13.19.)
The ethene  in these products  undergoes  a process  called  polymerization.
In polymerization,  hundreds  of ethene  molecules  are reacted  and strung
together  to make long chains of molecules.  Another  alkene,  propene,
undergoes  a similar  process  and thus increases  the variety  of possible
polymers.
On the previous  page, you learned  that ethene  is used to ripen fruit.
How does this work? Whena fruit ripens,  enzymes  in the fruit begin to
produce  ethene  gas. The ethene  is responsible  for the colour  change,  as
well as the softening  and sweetening  that occur as the fruit ripens.  Food
chemists  have learned  that they can suppress  ethene  production  (and
delay ripening)  by keeping  fruits at a low temperature  as they are
transported.  Once the fruits reach their final destination,  ethene can be
pumped  into the fruit containers  to hasten  the ripening  process.  No
wonder  you can get such a variety  of fresh fruit at the supermarket!
In the next investigation,  you will use reactivity  to identify  saturated
and unsaturated  compounds  in some everyday  products.  Saturated  and
unsaturated  compounds  play an important  part in healthy  eating,  as you
will discover.

The names of alkenes  follow  the same format  as the names of alkanes:
prefix + root + suffix. The prefixes  and the steps for locating  and identify-
ing branches  are the same, too. The greatest  difference  involves  the double
bond. The suffix -ene immediately  tells you that a compound  has at least
one double  bond. The rest of the necessary  information—the  location  of
the double  bond, and the number  of carbon  atoms in the main chain—is
communicated  in the root. Follow  the steps below  to find out how to
name the compound  in Figure 13.20.

This ensures  that the double  bond
gets the lowest  possible  position
number.
To create  the prefix, identify  and
locate the branches  with numbers.m If there is more than one branch,
remember  to put the branches  in
alphabetical  order.
CH; m There are two carbons  in the
| branch that is attached  to the
number  2 carbon  of the main
chain. Therefore  the prefix is
2-ethyl-.  (Miake sure that you
understand  why -ethyl is used.)
Use the formula  prefix + root + suffix to put the name together.  The full
name of this compound  is 2-ethyl-1-butene.  Remember  that a hyphen  is
placed between  numbers  and letters,  and commas  are placed  between
consecutive  numbers.
556 =MHR- Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
In 2-ethyl-1-butene,  the double  bond and the branch  are near each other
on the carbon  chain. What happens  if the double  bond is close to one end
of the carbon  chain, but the branches  are close to the other end? For
example,  how would  you name the compound  in Figure 13.21?
The methyl  branch  is close to the right end of the main chain. The
double  bond is close to the left end of the main chain. Therefore  you
need to follow  the rule in step 2: the double  bond has the lowest  possible
position  number.  Now you can combine  the name as follows:
e The 5-carbon  main chain is numbered  from the left. The double  bond is
given the number  2 (because  2 is lower than 3). The root and the suffix
are -2-pentene.
e The prefix is 4-methyl-  since there is a 1-carbon  branch  on the fourth
carbon  of the main chain.
e The complete  name is 4-methyl-2-pentene.
Although  the compounds  you have just named  have different  structural
formulas,  they both have the same molecular  formula:  CsHi2. These
compounds  are both isomers  of CgHj2! You worked  with structural  iso-
mers earlier  in this chapter.  You have seen that isomers  can be made by
rearranging  carbon  and hydrogen  atoms and creating  new branches.  Now
you will learn that isomers  can also be made by rearranging  double  bonds.
Drawing  Alkenes
You draw alkenes  using the same method  you learned  for drawing
alkanes.  There is only one difference:  you have to place the double  bond
in the main chain. Remember  the valence  of carbon,  and be careful  to
count to four for each carbon  atom on the structure.  (Figure  13.22 gives
an example  of another  alkene,  2-methyl-2-butene.)  Be especially  careful
with the carbon  atoms on each side of the double  bond. The double  bond
is worth two for each carbon!  Now complete  the Practice  Problems  to
reinforce  what you have learned  about naming  and drawing  alkenes.

Partner to find out more about
cis-trans  isomers.Remember  these general  rules:
e To have a cis-trans  (geometric)  isomer,  each carbon  in the G—=C double
bond must be attached  to two different  groups.
e In a cis isomer,  the two larger groups  are attached  to each C=C double
bond on the same side.
e In a trans isomer,  the two larger groups  are attached  to each C=C
double  bond on opposite  sides.
Like all isomers,  cis-trans  isomers  have different  physical  and chemical

What do tires and chewing  gum have in
common?  They are both made of elastomers:
any substance  you can pull or flex. Elastomer
molecules  can be crosslinked,  or chemically
linked,  to produce  rubber  that retains  its shape.
You can find elastomers  and/or  rubber  in many
everyday  products,  such as running  shoes,
tires, underwear,  and bubble  gum.
Elastomers  are a type of polymer,  or giant
molecule.  To form a polymer  such as an elas-
tomer,  many small molecules  are connected  to
form a chain with thousands  of repeating  units.
Elastomer  technology  is useful  in medicine.
Muscles  and arteries  contain  giant molecules,
called elastin,  that make muscles  and arteries
contract.  Doctors  can give artificial  arteries  to
people  with severe  heart problems  or other
diseases.  Unfortunately  these artificial  arteries
do not last long enough.  Can they be replaced
by a new type of elastomer?
Judit Puskas
Dr. Judit Puskas  holds Canada’s  first Industrial
Research  Chair in Elastomer  Technology  at the
University  of Western  Ontario  in London,
Ontario.  She thinks that an elastomer  called
polyisobutylene,  along with some of its deriva-
tives, looks promising.  In the future,  it may be
used to make better artificial  arteries.  It may
also be useful for other implants,  since it can
imitate  the rubber-like  properties  of elastin.Although  elastomers  and rubber  have many
helpful  and useful properties,  they can also
cause problems.  For example,  rubber  is used to
make safe tires for cars, trucks,  and other vehi-
cles. These tires wear out and must be changed
regularly.  As a result, Canada  and the United
States accumulate  275 million  used tires every
year! What can be done with these used tires?
Scrap tires that are left in piles may catch
on fire. Since tires usually  burn with incom-
plete combustion,  many dangerous  and
polluting  gases are emitted  into the environ-
ment. In addition,  burning  tires can leak oil
and aromatic  hydrocarbons  into the soil.
Thus they can contaminate  drinking  water
in the area.
Tire manufacturers  try to reduce  waste
by making  tires that last longer. Unfortunately,
when these durable  radial tires break down,
they disintegrate  into small airborne  particles,
instead  of large pieces  as older tires do. This
“tire dust” contains  latex rubber,  which  is an
allergen.  As well, tire dust is small enough  to
be breathed  deeply  into the lungs. Tire dust
may be one reason  why asthma  is becoming
more common  in North America.
Since tires are made of hydrocarbons,  scrap
tires can be used as a fuel source.  Tire derived
fuel (TDF) is used in power  plants,  paper mills,
and cement  kilns. Environmentalists  are con-
cerned,  however,  that incomplete  combustion
may result in the release  of toxins.

GETIERERZ]  Alkynes  are linear
around  the triple bond, as these
examples  show.Alkynes
Carbon  and hydrogen  atoms can be arranged  in many ways to produce  a
great variety  of compounds.  Yet another  way involves  triple bonds in the
structure  of compounds.  This bond structure  creates  a class of aliphatic
compounds  called alkynes.  Alkynes  are aliphatic  compounds  that contain
one or more triple bonds.
Naming  and Drawing  Alkynes
Both double  and triple bonds are multiple  bonds.  Therefore  alkynes  are
unsaturated  hydrocarbons,  just as alkenes  are. To name alkynes  and draw
their structures,  you follow  the same rules that you used for alkenes.  The
only difference  is the suffix -yne, which  you need to use when naming
alkyne  compounds.  Also, remember  to count the number  of bonds for
each carbon.  An alkyne  bond counts  as three bonds.
As you might expect,  the presence  of a triple bond in alkynes  makes
their physical  and chemical  properties  different  from those of alkanes  and
alkenes.  A structure  with a triple bond must be linear around  the bond.
(See Figure 13.24.) This means  that the shapes  of alkynes  are different
from the shapes  of alkanes  and alkenes.  As well, the triple bond makes
the molecule  much more reactive—even  more so than the double  bond.
In fact, few alkynes  occur naturally  because  they are so reactive.
Alkynes  are similar  to both alkanes  and alkenes  because  they form a
homologous  series. Alkynes  have the general  formula  of C,H2n-2.  So, for
example,  the first member  of the alkyne  series, ethyne,  has the formula
C,H. (You may know this compound  by its common  name: acetylene.)
The next member,  propyne,  has the formula  C3H,.

Cyclic Hydrocarbons
You have probably  heard the term “steroid”  used in the context  of athlet-
ics. (See Figure 13.25.)  Our bodies  contain  steroids,  such as testosterone
(a male sex hormone)  and estrone  (a female  sex hormone).  Steroids  also
have important  medicinal  uses. For example,  budesonide  is a steroid
that is used to treat asthma.  One of the most common  steroids  is
cholesterol.  This compound  is essential  to your normal  body functions,
but it has been linked  to blocked  artery  walls and heart disease,  as well.
Steroids  have also been associated  with misuse,  especially  at the
Olympics  and other sporting  events. Some athletes  have tried to gain an
advantage  by using steroids  to increase  their muscle  mass.

GPTIEEEZ]  Steroids  are organic  compounds.  Our bodies make steroids  naturally.
Steroids  may also be synthesized  in chemical  laboratories.  What do the structures  of
these steroids  have in common?
What do steroids  have to do with hydrocarbons?  Steroids  are
unsaturated  compounds.  Although  they are complex  organic  molecules,
their basic structure  centres  on four rings of carbon  atoms.  In other words,
steroids  are built around  ring structures  of alkanes  and alkenes.
Hydrocarbon  ring structures  are called cyclic hydrocarbons.  They
occur when the two ends of a hydrocarbon  chain join together.  In order to
do this, a hydrogen  atom from each end carbon  must be removed,  just as
in the formation  of a multiple  bond. (See Figure 13.26 on the next page.)
Chapter  13 The Chemistry  of Hydrocarbons  * MHR 561
You should  have no trouble  recognizing  cyclohexane  as a member  of
the alkane  family.  Notice,  however,  that cycloalkanes,  such as cyclohexa-
ne, have two fewer hydrogen  atoms compared  with other alkanes.  Thus
they have the general  formula  C,,H2,. (This is the same as the general  for-
mula for alkenes.)
Naming  and Drawing  Cyclic Hydrocarbons
To draw the structure  of a cyclic hydrocarbon,  use a line diagram  in a
ring-like  shape, such as the one shown  in Figure 13.26. Each carbon-
carbon  bond is shown  as a straight  line. Each corner  of the ring represents
a carbon  atom. Hydrogen  atoms are not shown,  but they are assumed  to be
present  in the correct  numbers.

Because  of the ring structure,  the naming  rules for cyclic hydro-
carbons,  including  cycloalkanes  and cycloalkenes,  are slightly  different
from those for alkanes  and alkenes.  Below  are four examples  to illustrate
the naming  rules.
To draw cyclic hydrocarbons,  start with the rules you learned  for
drawing  other types of compounds.  To place multiple  bonds and branches,
you have the option  of counting  in either direction  around  the ring.
Naming  Cyclic Hydrocarbons
Example  1: You can still use the general  formula:  prefix + root + suffix. In
Figure 13.27, there are only single carbon-carbon  bonds.  There are also five
corners  (carbon  atoms)  in the ring, which is the main chain. Since there are
no branches,  the name of this compound  is cyclopentane.  Notice  the addi-
tion of cyclo-  to indicate  the ring structure.
Example  2: When naming  cyclic compounds,  all carbon  atoms  in the ring
are treated  as equal. This means  that any carbon  can be carbon  number  1.
In Figure 13.28, only one branch is attached  to the ring. Therefore  the
carbon  that the branch is attached  to is carbon number  1. Because  this
branch  automatically  gets the lowest  possible  position  number,  no positionCH3
| number is required in the name. Thus the name of this compound is
Figure 13.28 methylcyclohexane.
562} MHR-« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
Example  3: When two or more branches  are on a ring structure,  each must
have the lowest  possible  position  number.  Which  way do you count the
carbons  around  the ring? You can count in either direction  around  the ring. In
Figure 13.29, a good choice is to make the ethy! branch  carbon number  1 and
then count counterclockwise.  This allows  you to sequence  the branches  in CH, — CH;
alphabetical  order and to add the position  numbers  in ascending  order. So
the name of this structure  is 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclohexane. | Figure 13.29 |CH;
Example  4: In Figure 13.30, there is a double  bond, represented  by the
extra vertical  line inside  the ring structure.  You must follow  the same rules
as for alkenes.  That is, the double  bond gets priority  for the lowest  number.
This means  that one of the carbon  atoms,  on either end of the double  bond, CH;
must be carbon number  1. The carbon  atom at the other end must be carbon
number  2. Next you have to decide in which direction  to count so that the
branch  gets the lowest  possible  position  number.  In this compound,  the
carbon  atom on the bottom  end of the double  bond is carbon  number  1.
Then you can count clockwise  so that the methyl! group on the top carbon | Figure 13.30 |
of the ring has position  number  3. (Counting  in the other direction  would
give a higher  locating  number  for the branch.)  The name of this structure
is 3-methyl-1-cyclohexene.

(GETESREXZ]  This oil refinery  is in Clarkson,  Ontario.
Reliance  on hydrocarbons  has increased  substantially  since the nineteenth
century.  Our society  now requires  these compounds  for fuel, as well as for
the raw materials  that are used to synthesize  petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals  are basic hydrocarbons,  such as ethene  and propene,  that
are converted  into plastics  and other synthetic  materials.  Petroleum  is the
chief source of the petrochemicals  that drive our cars and our economy.
Petroleum  is not a pure substance,  however.  Rather,  petroleum  is a com-
plex mixture  of hydrocarbons—mainly  alkanes  and alkenes—of  varying
molecular  sizes and states. Because  petroleum  is a mixture,  its composi-
tion varies  widely  from region  to region  in the world.  An efficient  process
is essential  for separating  and collecting  the individual,  pure hydrocarbon
components.  Read on to learn about this process  in greater  detail.

Using Properties  to Separate  Petroleum  Components
Fractional  distillation  is a process  for separating  petroleum  into its
hydrocarbon  components.  This process  relies on a physical  property—
boiling  point. Each of the hydrocarbon  components,  called  fractions,  has
its own range of boiling  points.  At an oil refinery,  the separating  (refining)
of petroleum  begins  in a large furnace.  The furnace  vaporizes  the liquid
components.  The fluid mixture  then enters a large fractionation  tower.
Figure 13.35 outlines  how the various  hydrocarbon  fractions  are separated
in the tower. (Note: The temperatures  shown  are approximate
boiling  points for the hydrocarbon  fractions.)

tower
Perforated  plates,  which  are fitted with bubble  caps, are placed  at various
levels in the tower. As each fraction  reaches  a plate where  the temperature
is just below its boiling  point, it condenses  and liquefies.  The liquid
fractions  are taken from the tower by pipes. Other fractions  that are still
vapours  continue  to pass up through  the plates to higher  levels.
Several  plates are needed  to collect  each fraction.  Heavier  hydro-
carbons  (larger  molecules)  have higher  boiling  points.  They condense  first
and are removed  in the lower sections  of the tower. The lighter  hydrocar-
bons, with lower boiling  points,  reach the higher  levels of the tower
before  they are separated.Wee LINK

Cracking  and Reforming
Once the fractions  are removed  from the distillation  tower, they may
be chemically  processed  or purified  further  to make them marketable.
(See Figure 13.36.) There has been a tremendous  increase  in the demand
for a variety  of petroleum  products  in the early twentieth  century.  This
demand  has forced  the oil industry  to develop  new techniques  to increase
the yield from each barrel of oil. These techniques  are called cracking  and
reforming.

Cracking  was first introduced  in Sarnia,  Ontario.  This process  uses heat to
break larger  hydrocarbon  molecules  into smaller  gasoline  molecules.
Cracking  is done in the absence  of air and can produce  different  types of
hydrocarbons.  For example,  the cracking  of propane  can produce  methane
and ethene,  as well as propene  and hydrogen.  (See Figure 13.37.)

Reforming  is another  technique  that uses heat, pressure,  and catalysts  to
convert  large hydrocarbons  into other compounds.  Reforming  can produce
larger hydrocarbons  or a different  type of hydrocarbon,  called aromatic
compounds.  (See Figure 13.38.)  Aromatic  compounds  contain  special  ring

Bulletproof  vests used to be heavy, bulky, and
uncomfortable.  Stephanie  Kwolek  changed  that.
Now police officers,  police dogs, and soldiers,
can wear light, strong bulletproof  vests made of
a synthetic  fibre called KevlarTM.  Kwolek  (shown
above)  developed  KevlarTM  while working  for the
DuPont  chemical  company.  KevlarTM  first came
into general  use in 1971. It is five times stronger
than steel, gram for gram, but almost  as light as
nylon. It is flame resistant,  resists  wear and tear,
and does not conduct  electricity.  This versatile
material  is used not only in bulletproof  vests, but
also in other manufactured  items, including  hock-
ey helmets,  firefighters’  suits, spacecraft  shells,
and surgeons’  gloves.
Kwoluk’s  branch  of organic  chemistry—poly-

The whole world runs on energy—and  so do you! Fossil fuels provide
energy  to power  cars and heat buildings.  Food provides  energy  to keep
your body alive and warm. Both sources  of energy  come from organic
compounds,  such as hydrocarbons,  sugars,  and proteins.
Green plants,  algae, and plankton  trap the Sun’s energy  through  the
process  of photosynthesis.  After these organisms  die, they are broken
down by natural  processes.  Their remains  accumulate  on Earth’s  surface.
In some areas, these remains  build up in thick layers,  which  are eventual-
ly covered  by rock and soil. Under  certain  conditions,  over billions  of
years, pressure  changes  these layers into something  new: fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels (such as coal, natural  gas, and petroleum)  are fuels that are
made from fossilized  organic  materials.  The trapped  energy  from the Sun
is still present  in fossil fuels. To use this energy,  we need to extract  it.
Combustion,  or burning,  is the most common  way to extract  energy  from
fossil fuels.
In this chapter,  you will explore  the ways in which  our society  obtains
energy  from fossil fuels. You will get a chance  to measure  exactly  how
much energy  is obtained  from an organic  substance  by doing your own
combustion  reaction.  As well, you will learn how dangerous  incomplete
combustion  reactions  can be.

Combustion  Reactions
One of our most common  uses of hydrocarbons  is as fuel. (See Figure
14.1.) The combustion  of fossil fuels gives us the energy  we need to travel
and to keep warm in cold climates.  Fossil fuel combustion  is also an
important  source of energy  in the construction  and manufacturing  indus-
tries. As well, many power  plants  burn natural  gas when generating
electricity.  Even goldsmiths  use hydrocarbons,  such as butane,  as a heat
source  when crafting  gold jewellery.  At home, we often burn fossil fuels,
such as natural  gas, to cook our food.
How do we get energy  from these compounds?  In this section,  you
will learn how complete  and incomplete  combustion  can be expressed  as
chemical  equations.  Combustion  in the presence  of oxygen  is a chemical
property  of all hydrocarbons.  (In Chapter  13, you learned  about some
physical  properties  of hydrocarbons,  such as boiling  point and solubility.)

Chemistry  Bulletin
Abraham  Gesner  was born in 1797 near
Cornwallis,  Nova Scotia.  Although  Gesner
became  a medical  doctor,  he was much more
interested  in fossils.  Gesner  was fascinated  by
hydrocarbon  substances,  such as coal, asphal-
tum (asphalt),  and bitumen.  These substances
were formed  long ago from fossilized  plants,
algae, fish, and animals.
When Gesner  was a young  man, the main
light sources  available  were fire, candles,  and
whale oil lamps. Gesner  had made several
trips to Trinidad.  He began to experiment  with
asphaltum,  a semisolid  hydrocarbon  from
Trinidad’s  famous  “pitch  lake.” In 1846, while
giving  a lecture  in Prince  Edward  Island,  he
startled  his audience  by lighting  a lamp that
was filled with a fuel he had distilled  from
asphaltum.  Gesner’s  lamp fuel gave more light
and produced  less smoke  than any other lamp
fuel the audience  had ever seen used.
Gesner  needed  a more easily obtainable
raw material  to make his new lamp fuel. He
tried a solid, black, coal-like  bitumen  from
Albert  County,  New Brunswick.  This sub-
stance,  called albertite,  worked  better than
any other substance  that Gesner  had tested.
Making  Kerosene
One residue  from Gesner’s  distillation  process
was a type of wax. Therefore,  he called his
lamp fuel kerosolain,  from the Greek  word for
“wax oil.” He soon shortened  the name to
kerosene.  To produce  kerosene,  Gesner  heated
chunks  of albertite  in a retort (a distilling  ves-
sel with a long downward-bending  neck). As
the albertite  was heated,  it gave off vapours.
The vapours  passed  into the neck of the retort,
condensed  into liquids,  and trickled  down into
a holding  tank. Once Gesner  had finished  the
first distillation,  he let the tank’s contents  stand
for several  hours. This allowed  water and solid
to settle to the bottom.  Then he drew off the oil
that remained  on top.Gesner  distilled  this oil again, and then
treated  it with sulfuric  acid and calcium  oxide.
Finally  he distilled  the oil once more.
By 1853, Gesner  had perfected  his process.
In New York, he helped  to start the North
American  Kerosene  Gas Light Company.
Gesner  distinguished  between  three grades
of kerosene:  grades  A, B, and C. Grade C, he
said, was the best lamp oil. Grades  A and B
could also be burned  in lamps,  but they were
dangerous  because  they could cause explosions
and fires.
Although  Gesner  never knew, his grades
A and B kerosene  became  even more useful
than the purer grade C. These grades  were
later produced  from crude oil, or petroleum,
and given a new name: gasoline!
Gesner  laid the groundwork  for the
entire petroleum  industry.  All the basics of
later petroleum  refining  can be found in his
technology.

Complete  and Incomplete  Combustion
During  a typical  combustion  reaction,  an element  or a compound  reacts
with oxygen  to produce  oxides of the element  (or elements)  found in the
compound.  Figure 14.2 shows an example  of a combustion  reactions.
Hydrocarbon  compounds  will burn in the presence  of air to produce
oxides.  This is a chemical  property  of all hydrocarbons.  Complete
combustion  occurs  if enough  oxygen  is present. A hydrocarbon  that
undergoes  complete  combustion  produces  carbon  dioxide  and water
vapour.  The following  equation  shows the complete  combustion  of
propane.  (See also Figure 14.3.)

making  an effort to reduce  this

Go back to the equation  for the complete  combustion  of propane.  Notice
that the mole ratio of oxygen  to propane  for the complete  combustion
(5 mol oxygen  to 1 mol propane)  is higher  than the mole ratio for the
incomplete  combustion  (7 mol oxygen  to 2 mol propane,  or 3.5 mol oxy-
gen to 1 mol propane).  These ratios show that the complete  combustion
of propane  used up more oxygen  than the incomplete  combustion.  In
fact, the incomplete  combustion  probably  occurred  because  not enough
oxygen  was present.  You just learned  that incomplete  combustion  pro-
duces poisonous  carbon  monoxide.  This is why you should  never operate
a gas barbecue  or gas heater  indoors,  where there is less oxygen  available.
This is also why you should  make sure that any natural  gas or oil-burning
furnaces  and appliances  in your home are working  at peak efficiency,  to
reduce  the risk of incomplete  combustion.  Carbon  monoxide  detectors  are
a good safeguard.  They warn you if there is dangerous  carbon  monoxide
in your home, due to incomplete  combustion.

How do you write the balanced  equation  for the complete  combustion  of
acetylene  (ethyne)?  Complete  hydrocarbon  combustion  reactions  follow  a
general  format:
hydrocarbon  + oxygen  — carbon  dioxide  + water vapour
You can use this general  format  for the complete  combustion  of any
hydrocarbon,  no matter  how large or how small. For example,  both
acetylene  and propane  burn completely  to give carbon  dioxide  and water
vapour.  Each hydrocarbon,  however,  produces  different  amounts,  or mole
ratios, of carbon  dioxide  and water.
You have seen, written,  and balanced  several  types of reaction
equations  so far in this textbook.  In the following  sample  problem,  you
will learn an easy way to write and balance  hydrocarbon  combustion
equations.

Bond Breaking  and Bond Making
The formation  of acetylene  (ethyne)  gas from its elements  is an endother-
mic reaction.  The combustion  of acetylene,  however,  is exothermic.  In
fact, it releases  enough  heat energy  to cut steel! How can you explain

broken  and made? The answer  to this question  is fundamental  to your
understanding  of the energy  changes  that occur in chemical  reactions.

This illustration  shows bonds being broken  and made during a chemical
reaction.  If the bonds are strong,  there is a large change  in energy.  If the bonds are
weak,  there is a small change  in energy.
A chemical  bond is caused  by the attraction  between  the electrons  and
nuclei of two atoms. Energy  is needed  to break a chemical  bond, just like
energy  is needed  to break a link in a chain. On the other hand, making  a
chemical  bond releases  energy.  The strength  of a bond depends  on how
much energy  is needed  to break the bond. (see Figure 14.8.)
A specific  amount  of energy  is needed  to break each type of bond.
When the same type of bond is formed,  the same specific  amount  of
energy  is released.  The energy  that is absorbed  or released  when breaking
or making  a bond is called the bond energy.  Bond energy  is usually
measured  in kilojoules  (kJ). Table 14.1 shows some average  bond energies.
From the table, you can see that 347 kJ of energy  is needed  to break
one mole of C—C bonds in a sample  of propane  or any other carbon.
Similarly,  347 kJ of energy  is released  if one mole of C—C bonds forms in
a sample  of butane.
Every chemical  reaction  involves  both bond breaking  (reactant  bonds
are broken)  and bond making  (product  bonds are formed).  Since there are
different  types of bonds inside the reactant  and product  molecules,  the
bond breaking  and bond making  energies  are different.  This results  in a
net amount  of energy  for each reaction.
The next sample  problem  compares  bond breaking  and bond making

Problem
Consider  bond breaking  and bond making  to explain  why the
combustion  of acetylene  is exothermic.  Then write a thermochemical
equation  for the reaction,  using the following  balanced  equation:
What Is Required?
You need to describe  what happens  when the reactant  bonds are
broken  and what happens  when the product  bonds are formed.  You
need to compare  the energy  that is absorbed  when the reactant  bonds
are broken  with the energy  that is released  when the product  bonds
are formed.  Then you need to write a thermochemical  equation,
using the word “energy.”
What Is Given?
You know that energy  is absorbed  when bonds are broken  and
energy  is released  when bonds are formed.  You also know that the
equation  is exothermic.  (Overall,  energy  is released  in this reaction.)

Measuring  Energy  Changes
You have probably  had plenty  of experience  with heating  and cooling
materials  around  you. You know how to cool yourself  by taking  a cold
shower.  You know how to heat hot chocolate  on a stove. However,  have
you ever stopped  to think about what energy  changes  are occuring?
Where does the energy  come from, and where does it go?
Suppose  that you are very thirsty, but the tap water is not cold enough.
How can you get the water as cold as you want it to be? Your experience  tells you to add
ice to the water. How does the ice cool the water?
Any time that something  is cooled  or heated,  a change  in thermal  energy
occurs.  Thermal  energy  is the kinetic  energy  of particles  of matter.  In a
glass of tap water with ice (as shown  in Figure 14.9), the water started  out
warmer  than the ice. Energy  was transferred  from the water to the ice. As
the ice absorbed  the energy,  the ice melted.  As the water lost energy,  the
water cooled.
These examples  involve  heat. Heat is the transfer  of thermal  energy
between  objects  with different  temperatures.  In this section,  you will
study how to measure  the quantity  of thermal  energy  that is transferred
during  a process  involving  an energy  change.
Important  Factors  in Energy  Measurement
How can you measure  the change  in energy  when  you add ice to water?
Temperature  is a measure  of the average  kinetic  energy  of a system.  You
have already  had experience  using a thermometer  to measure  temperature.
By placing  a thermometer  in the water, you can monitor  the drop in
temperature  when the ice is added.  Temperature  is an important  factor
in heat energy  changes.  What other factors  are important?  Work through
the following  ThoughtLab  to find out.14.3

Two students  performed  an experiment  to
determine  what factors  need to be considered
when determining  the quantity  of thermal  energy
lost or gained by a substance  undergoing  an
energy  change.  They set up their experiment
as follows.
Part A
The students  placed  two different  masses  of
water, at the same initial temperature,  in separate
beakers.  They placed an equal mass of ice (from
the same freezer)  in each beaker.  Then they
monitored  the temperature  of each beaker.

2. Interpret  the students’  results  by answering
the following  questions.
(a) If ice is added  to two different  masses  of

(b) If ice is added  to two different  liquids,  how

Analysis
Think about  your interpretation  of the students’
experiment  and the discussion  prior to this
ThoughtLab.  What are three important  factors  to
consider  when measuring  the thermal  energy
change  of a substance?
The ThoughtLab  gave you some insight  into the factors  that are important
when measuring  energy  changes.  How can you use these factors  to calcu-
late the quantity  of heat that is transferred?  First you must examine  each
factor and determine  its relationship  to heat transfer.  You will begin with
the most obvious  factor: temperature.  Then you will look at how the mass
of a substance  affects  the quantity  of thermal  energy  it can store. Finally,
you will look at the type of substance  and how it affects  heat transfer.

Temperature
In the summer,  your body temperature  is fairly close to
the temperature  of your surroundings.  You do not need
to wear extra clothing  to keep warm. When winter  hits
with fierce winds and cold temperatures,  however,  dressing
warmly  becomes  a necessity.  The temperature  of your sur-
roundings  is now much colder  than your body temperature.
Heat is transferred  from your body to your surroundings,
making  you feel cold. The extra clothing  helps to minimize
heat loss from your body. (See Figure 14.10.)
Temperature  is directly  related  to heat transfer.  A large
change  in temperature  indicates  a large energy  change.
A small change in temperature  indicates  a small energy How do you con-

used is the change  in temperature.  This is symbolized  by AT.' a’
Mass of Substance
Did you know that 70% of Earth’s  surface  is covered  with water?  This
enormous  mass of water absorbs  and releases  tremendous  amounts  of
heat energy.  Water  makes our climate  more moderate  by absorbing  heat
in hot weather  and releasing  heat in cold weather.  The greater  the mass
of the water, the greater  the amount  of heat it can absorb  and release.
(Areas  without  much water, such as deserts,  experience  huge variations
in temperature.)  Therefore,  mass is directly  related  to heat transfer.  Mass
is a variable  in the calculation  of heat energy.  It is symbolized  by a
lower-case  m.

the students  have prevented  this error?
Much of the technology  in our lives is designed  to stop the flow of
heat. Your home is insulated  to prevent  heat loss in the winter  and heat
gain in the summer.  If you take hot soup to school  for your lunch, you
probably  use a ThermosTM  to prevent  heat loss to the environment.
Whenever  there is a temperature  difference  between  two objects,
thermal  energy  flows from the hotter object  to the colder  object.  When
you measure  the heat being transferred  in a reaction  or other process,
you must minimize  any heat that is exchanged  with the surroundings.

A polystyrene
(coffee  cup) calorimeter  usually
consists  of two nested poly-
styrene  cups with a polystyrene
lid, to provide  insulation  from the
surroundings.To measure  the heat flow in a process,  you need an
isolated  system,  like a ThermosTM.  An isolated  system  stops
matter  and energy  from flowing  in or out of the system.  You
also need a known  amount  of a substance,  usually  water. The
water absorbs  the heat that is produced  by the process,  or it
releases  heat if the process  is endothermic.  To determine  the
heat flow, you can measure  the temperature  change  of the
water. With its large specific  heat capacity  (4.184  J/ g-°C) and
its broad temperature  range (0°C to 100°C),  liquid water can
absorb  and release  a lot of energy.
Water, a thermometer,  and an isolated  system  are the
basic components  of a calorimeter.  A calorimeter  is a device
that is used to measure  changes  in thermal  energy.  (Figures
14.14 and 14.15 show two types of calorimeters.)  The techno-
logical  process  of measuring  changes  in thermal  energy  is
called  calorimetry.
How Calorimeters  Work
In a polystyrene  calorimeter,  a known  mass of water is inside the poly-
styrene  cup. The water surrounds,  and is in direct contact  with, the
process  that produces  the energy  change.  The initial temperature  of the
water is measured.  Then the process  takes place and the final temperature
of the water is measured.  The water is stirred  to maintain  even energy
distribution,  and the system  is kept at a constant  pressure.  This type of
calorimeter  can measure  heat changes  during  processes  such as dissolv-
ing, neutralization,  heating,  and cooling.

elim eames A bomb calorime-
ter is more sophisticated  than a
polystyrene  calorimeter.
602 MHR- Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and EnergyA bomb calorimeter  is used for the measurement  of heat
changes  during  combustion  reactions  at a constant  volume.
It works on the same general  principle  as the polystyrene
calorimeter.  The reaction,  however,  takes place inside an inner
metal chamber,  called a “bomb.”  This “bomb”  contains  pure
oxygen.  The reactants  are ignited  using an electric  coil. A
known  quantity  of water surrounds  the bomb and absorbs  the
energy  that is released  by the reaction.  You will learn more
about bomb calorimeters  later in this section.
The law of conservation  of energy  states that energy  can
be changed  into different  forms,  but it cannot  be created  or
destroyed.  This law allows  you to calculate  the energy  change
in a calorimetry  experiment.  However,  you need to make the
following  assumptions:
e The system  is isolated.  (No heat is exchanged  with the
surroundings  outside  the calorimeter.)
e The amount  of heat energy  that is exchanged  with the
calorimeter  itself is small enough  to be ignored.
e If something  dissolves  or reacts in the calorimeter  water, the
solution  still retains  the properties  of water. (For example,
density  and specific  heat capacity  remain  the same.)
The First Ice Calorimeter
A calorimeter  measures  the thermal  energy  that
is absorbed  or released  by a material.  Today  we
measure  heat using joules (J) or calories  (cal).
Early scientists  accepted  one unit of heat as the
amount  of heat required  to melt 1 kg of ice. Thus
two units of heat could melt 2 kg of ice.
The earliest  measurements  of heat energy
were taken around 1760, by a Scottish  chemist
named  Joseph  Black. He hollowed  out a chamber
in a block of ice. Then he wiped the chamber  dry
and placed  a piece of platinum,  heated  to 38°C,
inside. He used another  slab of ice as a lid. As the
platinum  cooled,  it gave up its heat to the ice. The
ice melted,  and water  collected  in the chamber.
When the platinum  reached  the temperature  of
the ice, Black removed  the water and weighed  it
to find out how much ice had melted.  In this way,
he measured  the quantity  of heat that was
released  by the platinum.
In 1780, two French  scientists,  Antoine
Lavoisier  and Pierre Laplace,  developed  the first
apparatus  formally  called a calorimeter.  Like
Black, they used the amount  of melted  ice to
measure  the heat released  by a material.  Theircalorimeter  consisted  of three concentric  cham-
bers. The object  to be tested  was placed  in the
innermost  chamber.  Broken  chunks  of ice were
placed in the middle  chamber.  Ice was also
placed in the outer chamber  to prevent  any heat
reaching  the apparatus  from outside.  As the
object in the inner chamber  released  heat, the ice
in the middle  chamber  melted.  Water  was drawn
from the middle  chamber  by a tube, and then
measured.
Lavoisier  made many important  contributions
to the science  of chemistry.  Unfortunately  his
interest  in political  reform led to his arrest during
the French  Revolution.  He was beheaded  after a
trial that lasted less than a day.

The original  calorimeter  used by Lavoisier  and Laplace
When  a process  causes an energy  change  in a calorimeter,  the change
in temperature  is measured  by a thermometer  in the water. If you know
the mass of the water and its specific  heat capacity,  you can calculate  the
change  in thermal  energy  caused  by the process.  See Figures  14.16 and
14.17 for examples.

The energy  change  in a calorimetry  experiment  can be summarized
as follows:
Heat lost by the process  = Heat gained  by the water
or
Heat gained  by the process  = Heat lost by the water
In the next Sample  Problem,  you will use what you have just learned  to
calculate  the specific  heat capacity  of a metal. This problem  is similar  to
the calculation  of the specific  heat capacity  of canola  oil in section  14.3.
Here, however,  a calorimeter  is used to reduce  the heat exchange  to the
environment.
Determining  a Metal’s  Specific  Heat Capacity
Problem
A 70.0 g sample  of a metal was heated  to 95.0°C  in a hot water bath.
Then it was quickly  transferred  to a polystyrene  calorimeter.  The
calorimeter  contained  100.0 g of water at an initial temperature  of
19.8°C.  The final temperature  of the contents  of the calorimeter  was
22.6°C.
(a) How much heat did the metal lose? How much heat did the
water gain?
(b) What is the specific  heat capacity  of the metal?
What Is Required?
(a) You need to calculate  the heat lost by the metal (Q,,) and the
heat gained  by the water (Q,).
(b) You need to calculate  the specific  heat capacity  of the metal.
What Is Given?
You know the mass of the metal, and its initial and final
temperatures.
Mass of metal (mm) = 70.0 g
Initial  temperature  of metal (T;) = 95.0°C
Final temperature  of metal (T;) = 22.6°C
You also know the mass of the water, and its initial and final
temperatures.
Mass of water (m,,) = 100.0 g
Initial temperature  of water (T;) = 19.8°C
Final temperature  of water (T;) = 22.6°C
As well, you know the specific  heat capacity  of water: 4.184 J/g-°C.

Plan Your Strategy
(a) You have all the information  that you need to find the heat gained
by the water. Use the heat equation  Q = mcAT. To find the heat
lost by the metal, assume  that Qn = —Qw.
(b) Calculate  the specific  heat capacity  of the metal by rearranging
the heat equation  and solving  for c.
It is very important  that you do not mix up the given information.
For example,  when solving  for the thermal  energy  change  of the
water, Qy, make sure that you only use variables  for the water. You
must use the initial temperature  of the water, 19.8°C,  not the initial
temperature  of the metal, 95.0°C.  Also, remember  that AT = T;— Tj.

The heat gained  by the water is a positive  value. The heat lost by the
metal is a negative  value. The heat is expressed  in joules. (Kilojoules
are also acceptable.)
The specific  heat capacity  of the metal is positive,  and it has the

Heat of Combustion
How much energy  is needed  for a natural  gas water heater,  like the one
shown  in Figure 14.18, to heat the hot water in your home?  It is probably
much more than you think! In the next Sample  Problem,  you will find
out. You will also calculate  the heat of combustion  of a hydrocarbon:  the
heat that is released  when combustion  occurs.
Calculating  Thermal  Energy
Problem
Many homes in North America  use natural  gas for general  heating
and for water heating.  Like calorimeters,  natural  gas water heaters
have an insulated  container  that is filled with water. A gas flame at
the bottom  heats the water. A typical  water heater  might hold 151 L
of water.
(a) How much thermal  energy  is needed  to raise the temperature  of
151 L of water from 20.5°C  to 65.0°C?  Note: Make the same three
assumptions  that you made for calorimeters.
(b) If it takes 506 g of methane  to heat this water, what is the heat of
combustion  of methane  per gram?
What Is Required?
(a) You need to calculate  the quantity  of thermal  energy  (Q) needed
to heat 151 L of water.
(b) You need to calculate  the heat released  per gram of methane
burned.
What Is Given?
(a) You know the initial and final temperatures  of the water. You also
know the volume  of the water.
Initial temperature  (Tj) = 20.5°C
Final temperature  (7;) = 65.0°C
Volume  = 151 L
As well, you know the specific  heat capacity  of water (c):
4.184 J/g-°C or 4.184 kJ/kg-°C.
(b) You know the mass of the methane.  Mass of methane  (m) = 506 g
Plan Your Strategy
(a) This problem  involves  thermal  energy  and a change  in tempera-
ture. You can use the heat equation  Q = mcAT. First calculate  the
mass of 151 L of water. (Remember  that the density  of water at
room temperature  is 1 g/mL, or 1 kg/L.) If you express  the mass of
the water in kilograms,  you must also use the appropriate  specific
heat capacity  of water: 4.184 kJ/kg-°C.
Note: To keep the calculation  simple,  assume  that the density  of
the water remains  the same when it is heated.  (This is not strictly
true.)

(b) Use the concept  of heat lost = heat gained.  Since a loss of heat
gives a negative  value, use the following  equation.
Qm = —Qw
To find the heat per gram, divide  the amount  of heat by the mass
of methane.
Act on Your Strategy
(a) Mass of water = Volume  x Density
= (151 L)(1 kg/L)
=151kg
Substitute  into Q = mcAT, and solve.
Q = mcAT
= (151 kg)(4.184  kJ/kg-°C)(65.0°C  — 20.5°C)
= 28 114 (kg)(kJ/kg-2e) (CE)
= 2.81 x 10* kJ
Therefore,  2.81 x 10* kJ, or 28.1 MJ (megajoules),  of energy  is needed
to heat the water. (This is a great deal of energy!)
(b) Qmn = —-Qw
= —2.81 x 10* kJ
Divide  the amount  of heat by the mass of methane  to find the
heat per gram.
—~ Qn Qm (per gram) = im,
_ —2.81 x 10*kJ
506 g
= -55.5 kj/g
This means  that 55.5 kJ of thermal  (heat) energy  is released
for each gram of methane  that burns.
Check  Your Solution
(a) The water gains heat, so the heat value is positive.
Heat is expressed  in kilojoules.  (Joules  are also acceptable.)
(b) The methane  loses energy,  so the heat value is negative.  Since
this value is the heat per gram, the unit is kJ/g.

A Closer Look at Bomb Calorimetry
Polystyrene  calorimeters  are reasonably  efficient  for measuring  heat
changes  during  physical  processes,  such as dissolving  and phase changes.
They can also be used to measure  heat changes  during  chemical  process-
es, such as neutralization.  A stronger  and more precise  type of calorimeter
is needed,  however,  to measure  the heat of combustion  of foods, fuels, and
other materials.  As you learned  earlier,  bomb calorimeters  are used for
this purpose.  (See Figure 14.19.)
acti acmaee Bomb calorimeters  give more accurate  measurements  than
polystyrene  calorimeters.
A bomb calorimeter  has many more parts than a polystyrene  calorimeter.
All of these parts can absorb or release  small quantities  of energy.
Therefore,  you cannot  assume  that the heat lost to the calorimeter  is small
enough  to be negligible.  To obtain  precise  heat measurements,  you must
know or find out the heat capacity  of the bomb calorimeter.  Heat capacity
is the ratio of the heat gained  or lost by a system  to the change  in tempera-
ture caused  by this heat. It is usually  expressed  in kJ/°C. Unlike  specific
heat capacity,  which  refers to a single substance,  heat capacity  refers to a
system.  Thus, the heat capacity  of a calorimeter  takes into account  the
heat that al/ parts of the calorimeter  can lose or gain. (See Figure 14.20.)

upper-case  C. It is usually  expressed  in the unit J/°C.aCe LINK

A bomb calorimeter  is calibrated  for a constant  mass of water. Since the
mass of the other parts remain  constant,  there is no need for mass units in
the heat capacity  value. The manufacturer  usually  includes  the heat
capacity  value(s)  in the instructions  for the calorimeter.
Heat calculations  must be done differently  when the heat capacity  of a
calorimeter  is included.  The next Sample  Problem  illustrates  this.

GETIEELZ ES Food contains
energy,  which is usually
measured  in Calories.Food as a Fuel
Food is the fuel for your body. It provides  you with the energy  you need
to function  every day. Unlike  the peanut  butter in the previous  problem,
the food you digest is not burned.  The process  of digestion,  however,  is
very similar  to burning.  In fact, people  often talk about “burning  off
Calories.”  When food is digested,  it undergoes  slow combustion  (without
flames!)  as it reacts with the oxygen  you breathe.  Eventually  this combus-
tion produces  the materials  that your body needs. It also releases  carbon
dioxide  and water vapour  as waste.
You have probably  noticed  that Calories  are used more often than
kilojoules  when discussing  the energy  in food (Figure  14.21). How are
these terms related?
For years, chemists  used the calorie  as a unit of energy.  One calorie  is
equal to 4.184 J. This is the amount  of energy  that is required  to heat 1 g
of liquid water by 1°C. The food Calorie  (notice  the upper-case  C) is equal
to one thousand  calories,  or one kilocalorie.  Therefore  one food Calorie  is
equal to 4.184 kj.
You will recall that in the last sample  problem,  16.0 g of peanut  butter
released  418 kJ of energy.  To translate  a value in kilojoules  into Calories,
multiply it by the fraction Cal _ For the Sample  Problem,pty y 4.184 kJ Pp
418 kJ x EW  = 100 Cal
Therefore,  16.0 g of peanut  butter  released  100 Cal of energy.  Table 14.3
gives energy  values in Calories  for some foods.

Which compound  releases  more energy  per

a carbohydrate  such as sugar (assume  glucose,
CeHi206s)),  or a protein  (assume  collagen,  molar

A sample  of glucose  is placed in a bomb
calorimeter,  along with oxygen.  The glucose  is
completely  burned.  The process  is repeated  with
a sample  of oleic acid and a sample  of collagen.
The following  results  are recorded:When  you take in food energy,  your body stores
excess food energy  in the form of fat. If your body
needs energy  later, it will use up some of this fat. This
is the secret  behind  hibernation.  Why is excess energy
in your body stored as fat? Why is it not stored as
protein  or carbohydrates?  The next ThoughtLab  will
examine  these questions.  You will do calculations  to
find out which  substance  releases  the most heat when
burned.
GEEEEZ 2] Many mammals  in the animal kingdom  rely on fat
that is stored in their bodies.  By surviving  on fat reserves  that are
stored during the autumn,  bears can hibernate  throughout  the

One of the substances  that you considered  in the last ThoughtLab  was
oleic acid. Oleic acid has a long hydrocarbon  chain in each molecule.
This hydrocarbon  chain is similar  to the hydrocarbon  chains  of fossil
fuels, such as octane. (See Figure 14.23.)

Then compare  the structures

combustion  of fossil fuels must be similar  to the heat of combustion  of fats.
What is the relationship  between  the chemical  bonds in a compound  and
the amount  of energy  that the compound  can store? You already  know
that the net energy  of a reaction  equals  the difference  between  the energy
absorbed  when the reactant  bonds are broken  and the energy  released
when the product  bonds are formed.  The size of the difference  reflects
the strength  of the bonds in the reactant  molecules  compared  with the
strength  of the bonds in the product  molecules.
Figure 14.24 shows an exothermic  reaction:  the combustion  of
methane.  The stored energy  of the products  is less than the stored energy
of the reactants.  Therefore,  a net amount  of energy  is released  by the
reaction.  In an endothermic  reaction,  the stored energy  of the products
is greater  than the stored energy  of the reactants.

Most of the energy  change  in a reaction  is due to a change  in the

made of the same elements:  carbon  and hydrogen.  They react to give the
same combustion  products.  As a result, the difference  in the quantity  of
heat energy  that is released  by any two hydrocarbons  is directly  related  to
the stored energy  in the bonds of these compounds.  The next ThoughtLab

The Combustion  of Candles
So far in this chapter,  you have focussed  on gaseous  hydrocarbons,  such
as methane  and acetylene.  You have examined  their heats of combustion
and various  processes  in which  they are used. In your everyday  life, you
may have encountered  another  type of hydrocarbon:  paraffins.  Paraffins
are long chain hydrocarbons.  They are semisolid  or solid at room
temperature.  One type of paraffin  has been a household  item for cen-
turies—paraffin  wax, C25Hs52(s),  better known  as candle  wax. (See Figure
14.25.)
Like other hydrocarbons,  the paraffin  wax in candles  undergoes  com-
bustion  when burned.  It releases  thermal  energy  in the process.  In the fol-
lowing  investigation,  you will measure  this thermal  energy.

See Figure 14.30 for some ideas.

Hydrocarbon  fuels have changed  the way we live. Our dependence  on
them, however,  has affected  the world around  us. The greenhouse  effect,

dioxide  by the combustion  of fossil fuels. Carbon  dioxide  is an important
greenhouse  gas. Greenhouse  gases trap heat in Earth’s  atmosphere  and
prevent  the heat from escaping  into outer space. Scientists  think that a
build-up  of carbon  dioxide  in the atmosphere  may lead to an increase  in
global temperature,  known  as global  warming.  The diagram  below shows
how these concepts  are connected  to fossil fuels.

Acid Rain
The combustion  of fossil fuels releases  sulfur and nitrogen  oxides.  These
oxides  react with water vapour  in the atmosphere  to produce  acid rain.
Some lakes in northern  Canada  are “dead”  because  acid rain has killed
the plants,  algae, and fish that used to live in them. Forests  in Québec
and other parts of Canada  have also suffered  from acid rain.
Oil Spill Pollution
Our society  demands  a regular  supply  of fossil fuels. Petroleum  is trans-
ported  from oil-rich  countries  to the rest of the world. If an oil tanker
carrying  petroleum  has an accident,  the resulting  oil spill can be
disastrous  to the environment.
Chapter  14 Energy  Trapped  in Hydrocarbons  * MHR_ 623
Oil Spill Advisor
Developed  nations,  such as Canada,  depend
heavily  on petroleum.  Our dependence  affects
the environment  in many ways. Oil spills are a
dramatic  example  of environmental  harm caused
by petrochemicals.  In the news, you may have
seen oceans  on fire and wildlife  choked  with tar.
What can we do?
Obviously  the best thing to do is to prevent  oil
spills from taking place. Stricter  regulations  and
periodic  inspections  of oil storage  companies
help to prevent  oil leakage.  Once an oil spill has
occurred,  however,  biological,  mechanical,  and
chemical  technologies  can help to minimize
harm to the environment.
Biological  methods  involve  helpful micro-
organisms  that break down, or biodegrade,
the excess  oil. Mechanical  methods  depend  on
machines  that physically  separate  spilled  oil
from the environment.  For example,  barriers
and booms  are used to contain  an oil spill and
prevent  it from spreading.  Materials  such as
sawdust  are sprinkled  on a spill to soak up the oil.
eeea LINK
www.school.mcgrawhill.ca/Two main chemical  strategies  are also used
to clean up oil spills. In the first strategy,  gelling
agents  are added to react with the oil. The reac-
tion results  in a bulky product  that is easier  to
collect  using mechanical  methods.  In the second
strategy,  dispersing  agents  break up oil into small
droplets  that mix with the water. This prevents
the oil from reaching  nearby  shorelines.
Dispersing  agents  work in much the same way
as a bar of soap!
The scientific  advisor  for an oil spill response
unit assesses  a spill and determines  the appropri-
ate clean-up  methods.  She or he acts as part of
a team of advisors.  Most advisors  have an M.Sc.
or Ph.D. in an area of expertise  such as organic
chemistry,  physical  chemistry,  environmental
chemistry,  biology,  oceanography,  computer
modelling,  or chemical  engineering.
Oil spill response  is handled  by private  and
public organizations.  All these organizations  look
for people  with a background  in chemistry.  In
fact, much of what you are learning  about
hydrocarbons  can be related  to oil spill response.
Hydrocarbon  chemistry  can lead you directly

pollution  from ships and tankers.  In total, three million  tonnes  of oil reach
the ocean each year. This is equivalent  to having  an oil spill disaster

A student  from Thornhill,  Ontario,  did a home experiment  to discover
how much oil remains  in “empty”  motor oil containers  that are thrown
out. He collected  100 empty oil containers  from  a local gas station.  Then
he measured  the amount  of oil that was left in each container.  He found
an average  of 36 mL per container.  Over 130 million  oil containers  are
sold and thrown  out in Canada  each year. Using these figures,  he
MEHR « Unit 5 Hydrocarbons  and Energy
calculated  that nearly  five million  litres of oil are dumped  into landfill
sites every year, just in “empty”  oil containers!
Once oil reaches  the environment,  it is almost  impossible  to clean up.
Oil leaking  from a landfill  site can contaminate  drinking  water in the area.
Because  oil can dissolve  similar  substances,  pollutants  such as chlorine
and pesticides,  and other organic  toxins,  mix with the oil. They are
carried  with it into the water system,  increasing  the problem.
Solutions  to Environmental  Problems
All of the problems  described  above hinge on our use of fossil fuels. Thus,
cutting  back on our use of fossil fuels will help to reduce  environmental
damage.  Cutting  back on fossil fuels, however,  depends  on the consumers
who buy petrochemicals  and use fossil fuels. In other words,  it depends
on you and the people  you know.
Corporations  that are looking  for profit have little incentive  to change
their use of fossil fuels. For example,  the technology  is available  to build
cars that can drive about 32 km on  a single litre of fuel. Because  this tech-
nology  is not financially  profitable,  cars are still being produced  that drive
about 8 km per litre of fuel. If consumers  demand  and purchase  more
fuel-efficient  cars, however,  car manufacturers  will have an incentive  to
produce  such cars. Tougher  government  standards  may also help to push
the vehicle  industry  towards  greater  fuel efficiency.
Governments  can also bring about change  by endorsing  the principle
of sustainable  development.  This principle  was introduced  at the 1992
Earth Summit  Conference.  Sustainable  development  takes into account
the environment,  the economy,  and the health and needs of society.
(See Figure 14.31.)
Hydrocarbon  fuels and products  can benefit  our society  if they are
managed  well. They can cause great environmental  damage,  however,
if they are managed  irresponsibly.  With enough  knowledge,  you can
learn to make informed  decisions  on these important  issues.  Here are
some suggestions  of ways you can reduce  your consumption  of petroleum
products.  Why not choose  one or more methods  to practice?  Or, brain-
storm with your classmates  to think of other ways to reduce  consumption.
e Contact  your local government  and local power  companies.  Suggest
using alternative  fuels, such as solar energy  and wind power.
e Ride a bicycle  or walk more.
e Express  your concerns  by writing  letters to the government  or
to newspapers.
e Become  more informed  by researching  issues that concern  you.
e Fix oil leaks in vehicles,  and avoid dumping  oil down the sink.
e If you are cold at home, put on an extra sweater  instead  of
turning  up the heat.
e Recycle  and re-use petrochemical  products,  such as plastic
shopping  bags.
e Repair  a broken  item rather  than buying  a new one.Economy

Section  Wrap-up
In this section,  you learned  about some of the risks and benefits  resulting
from our use of fossil fuels. We obtain  gasoline,  heating  oil, jet fuel, diesel
fuel, fertilizers,  and plastics  from the oil and petroleum  industry.  Burning
fossil fuels, however,  produces  carbon  dioxide  (a greenhouse  gas) and
other pollutants  that lead to acid rain. Transporting  oil also carries  the
risk of oil spills. Do the benefits  of fossil fuels outweigh  the risks?

Consumer  Chemistry
Background
As a consumer,  you are continually  being exposed  to
new products.  Some of these products  can be contro-
versial.  For example,  foods such as tomatoes  and
soybeans  are genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs).
As a citizen  of the world, it is your responsibility  to
become  informed.  You should  know what is in the
products  you use. You should  understand  how to use
them appropriately  and safely, and how to dispose  of
them in a responsible  manner.

27. You will often see numbers  on gas pumps  that
indicate  how efficiently  the fuel burns. A high-
er number  indicates  a more efficient  fuel. These
numbers  refer to the “octane  rating”  of the fuel.
There is a direct relationship  between  the
octane  rating and the degree  of branching  in
fuel hydrocarbons.  The presence  of branches
increases  the efficiency  of a fuel. Arrange  the
following  hydrocarbon  compounds  in order of
increasing  octane  rating: 2-methylhexane,
heptane,  and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.  Explain.

Planet  Unknown
I, is the year 3000, and space travel is common-
place. Nearly  one trillion  human  beings  inhabit
the Milky  Way galaxy  now. They reside on thou-
sands of planets  that have been made habitable.
You are part of a scientific  team that has been
sent to a newly discovered  planet.  Your team must
analyse  the resources  present  on the planet.  You
will also decide  on the technological  processes
needed  to make the planet  a safe place to live.
This will involve  removing  dangerous  toxins from
the environment,  and identifying  possible  sources
of fuel, oxygen,  water, and food.
The newly  discovered  planet  has an insulating
atmosphere  and temperature  range similar  to
Earth’s.  Each day on the planet  is 25 Earth hours
long. Every day contains  8 hours of bright sun-
636 MHR - Course  Challengelight. However,  the planet  has no ocean,  no
surface  water, and no atmospheric  water at all.
There is evidence  that plant life once existed
on this planet.  Without  surface  water, however,
there are no plants living on the planet’s  surface
at the present  time. A small population  of bacteria
may be present.
One side of the planet  contains  a dry and
rocky desert, covered  in part by a large crater.
A thick layer of rock covers  the other side of the
planet.  Under  this rocky surface  runs a wide net-
work of lava-tube  tunnels.  Scientists  hypothesize
that a very large meteor  may have struck  the
planet  at one time. The meteor  knocked  off a
chunk  of the planet.  This chunk  now orbits the
planet  as a moon.
CHECKP(Y&YINT
Choose a name for the planet
you will explore.
Scientists  believe  that the enormous  heat of
this collision  decomposed  all surface  water into
hydrogen  and oxygen  gases. This explains  the lack
of surface  water on the planet.  The heat also trig-
gered massive  volcanic  eruptions.  These eruptions
resulted  in the rocky surface  and lava tunnels  that
cover half the planet.
Fortunately,  organic  dirt deposits  still exist
underground,  in pockets  beneath  the lava rock.
These dirt deposits  would  be useful for growing
food. A sufficient  air supply,  plant nutrients,  and
light will also be necessary  in order to grow food.This challenge  comprises  five parts, each

Part 2: Growing  Food
In your explorations,  your team discovers  a particularly  large under- Preview
ground  cavern.  The cavern  has a steady  water source seeping  out of phos-
phate rock. This trickling  water picks up a weak concentration  of phos-
phate ions as it filters through  the rock. There is plenty  of soil in this cav-
ern, although  extra plant nutrients  will need to be added on a regular
basis as crops are grown  and harvested.  This cavern  may be an excellent
site for growing  vegetables  and other plants.  A source of light will be
needed.In Part 2, you will apply the skills

Life as we know it is impossible  without  water. Thus it is essential  to
establish  a good water source.  Although  there is no surface  water of
any kind, the planet  does have water—underground!  Since this water
is constantly  filtered  through  underground  rocks and soil, it contains
many dissolved  substances.  Some of these substances  may be dangerous
to human  health.  These materials  will have to be removed  in order to
obtain  clean water. How can you find out what substances  are present
in the water?

underground  water. Analyse  the chemical  composition  of the water sam-
ple. (Note that the sample  you have may not be the same as the samples  of

tunnel.  At point B, a small river flows into the larger  river. This
smaller  river contains  dangerous  levels of toxic nitrite ions (NO;).
To prevent  the smaller  river from contaminating  the larger one, you
have decided  to limit the flow of the small river. Safety standards  per-
mit a maximum  of 3.2 mg of nitrite per litre of water. The flow of the
larger river is 1.2 x 10* L/s. The concentration  of nitrite in the smaller
river is 51.2 ppm. What amount  of water (in L/s) can be allowed  to
enter the larger river from the smaller  river?
Part 4: Planetary  Gases
The atmosphere  of the planet  is composed  of the following  gases:
argon (49.2%) carbon  dioxide  (1.3%)
oxygen  (30.8%) ammonia  (0.9%)
nitrogen  (14.6%) dinitrogen  oxide (0.5%)
hydrogen  cyanide  (2.3%) hydrogen  sulfide (0.4%)
Although  the atmosphere  contains  oxygen,  it also contains  gases that are
toxic to humans.  Eventually,  you hope to build a settlement  inside a huge
synthetic  bubble  with its own safe atmospheric  mixture  of gases. First,
your team must find an alternate  source of oxygen  gas. On Earth, plants
supply  oxygen  through  the process  of photosynthesis.  This may be the
best method  of providing  a constant  supply  of breathable  air for the settle-
ment bubble  on the new planet.  But do plants give off pure oxygen,  or a
mixture  of gases? How much oxygen  does a certain  mass of plants give off?

You may want to investigate  a different  problem.  For example:
Unit 1
e Suppose  matter  on the new planet  were not composed  of electrons,
protons,  and neutrons.  Devise  a new atomic  theory  of your own. Explain
how it works in “real life” on the planet.  Make up a small, functional
periodic  table with new, imaginary  elements.
e Develop  rules that explain  the bonding  between  your new atoms.
How do these rules affect the reactivity  of your elements  and structure
of your compounds?
Unit 2
e Suggest  reactions  that may make life easier on the planet.  Research  and
perform  these reactions  in the laboratory.  Write balanced  equations,  and
calculate  percent  yields in moles and in grams.  Explain  the purpose  of
these reactions  in the settlers  lives.
Unit 3
e Suggest  one or more substances  that may already  be dissolved  in the
water on the newly-discovered  planet.  Test the solubility  of the sub-
stance and plot solubility  curves for the solute in water. Explain  why
the substance  is in the water, and how the substance  will affect the life
of the settlers.  For example,  is it safe to drink?  How can it be removed
from the water?  Once extracted,  can it be used for anything  else?
Unit 4 ,
If you have time, work as
e Choose  a reaction  producing  a gas that may be useful  to settlers  on the a class to create a web
new planet.  Research  the reaction,  then carry it out in the laboratory. site based on this Course
Collect  the gas produced  and determine  its molar volume. Challenge.  Create a virtual
; tour of your planet's  resources,
Unit 5 projected  living spaces,  and
¢ Choose  three of these compounds:  NaOH, anhydrous  CaCl,, LiBr, HCl, scientific  adaptations.  Share
anhydrous  Na,SO4,  AgNO3,  KI, NH4sNO3,  NazCO3-10H,O,  and KMnOg. your findings with other grade
Desi . vgs . eleven classes  in youresign an investigation  to measure  and compare  the heats of solution nrovince  over the Internet
per mole of these chemicals.  Choose  one chemical  based on its heat of
solution,  and its safety  for everyday  use. Come up with a plan or device
that uses the heating  or cooling  effect produced  by this process  to help
the planet’s  settlers  remain  comfortable.
Your presentation  After preparing  lab reports  on one or more sections
of this Course  Challenge,  you will share your results  in a class presenta-
tion. Assume  this presentation  is being made to the Canadian  Minister
of Emigration,  the Canadian  Minister  of the Economy,  and a group of
business  people  who may wish to invest in the development  of the planet.
e Provide  your audience  with solutions  to the different  scenarios  and
problems  you investigated.  Be prepared  to respond  to other possible
questions  and problems  your audience  (your class and teacher)
may raise.
e To enhance  your presentation,  try to include  two or more of the
following:  posters,  brochures,  drama,  music,  lab demonstrations,  video
or audio clips, charts or graphs,  surveys,  models,  multimedia,  or web
pages with links.

Expanding  the
Model  of the Atom
In science,  theoretical  models  and experimental  evi-
dence are always  linked.  For example,  early scientists
believed  that rotting  meat generated  maggots.  This
seemed  reasonable,  since exposed  meat becomes  infest-
ed with maggots.  Experiments  proved,  however,  that if
the meat was protected  from flies, no maggots  appeared.
Thus, rotting  meat didn’t  generate  maggots;  flies did.
When a model  fails to explain  experimental  evidence,
scientists  must discard  or modify  that model.  The
model  of the atom is no exception.
Emission  Spectra
In Chapter  2, you used  a diffraction  grating  to observe
the spectra  of various  elements.  These elements  were
sealed  in gas discharge  tubes. The spectra  resulted  from
electrons  in atoms moving  from higher  energy  levels to
lower energy  levels and releasing  energy  as light.
Each wavelength  of visible  light is associated
with a colour.  When white light is shone through  a gas
discharge  tube, it produces  a line spectrum.  A line
spectrum  is a series of narrow  lines having  specific
colours  (energy),  separated  by colourless  spaces.  Each
element  produces  a different  and characteristic  emission
spectrum.  You can see several  examples  of these spectra
in Figure  D.1. Scientists  who were thinking  about how
to describe  the atom needed  to take the emission  spectra
into account.
400 nm 500 nm 600 nm 700 nm
400 nm 500 nm 600 nm 700 nm
GETEX]  The top spectrum  is the continuous  spectrum
of white light. The others  are emission  spectra  for hydrogen,
mercury,  and neon. Each element  has its own distinct
spectrum,  which is like a “fingerprint”  for that element.
656 MHR « Appendix  DBohr's Model of the Atom
In 1913, the Danish  physicist  Niels Bohr developed  a
model of the atom that explained  the hydrogen  emission
spectrum.  In Bohr’s  model,  electrons  orbit the nucleus
in the same way that Earth orbits the Sun, as shown  in
Figure  D.2. The following  three points of Bohr’s  theory
help to explain  hydrogen’s  emission  spectrum.
1. In Bohr’s  model,  atoms have specific  allowable
energy  levels. He called these energy  levels
stationary  states. Each of these levels corresponds
to a fixed, circular  orbit around  the nucleus.
2. An atom does not give off energy  when its electrons
are in a Stationary  state.
3. An atom changes  stationary  states by giving  off or
absorbing  a quantity  of light energy  exactly  equal to
the difference  in energy  between  the two stationary
states.
GETS)  In Bohr's atomic model, electrons  move around
the nucleus  with fixed, circular  orbits.
Bohr’s  model  was revolutionary,  because  he proposed
that the energy  absorbed  or emitted  by an atom needed
to have specific  values.  The energy  change  was
quantized,  rather  than continuous.  When something
is quantized,  it means  that it is limited  to discrete
amounts  or multiples  of discrete  amounts.  Two great
scientists  paved  the way for this surprising  idea.
German  physicist  Max Planck  had already  suggested
that energy  in general  was quantized,  meaning  that it
exists in “packets.”  Building  on this idea, Einstein
proposed  that light could behave  as particles,  which
he called  photons.
The energy  associated  with the light in a line
spectrum  corresponds  with the change  in energy  of an
electron  as it moves  up or down an energy  level. For
example,  when electrons  in hydrogen  atoms that have
been excited  to the third energy  level subsequently  drop
to the second  energy  level, they emit light that has a
specific  energy.  They emit photons  of red light that have
a wavelength  of 656.3 nm. These photons  cause the red
line on the line spectrum  for hydrogen,  which  you can
see in Figure  D.1.
Why a New Model?
So what was the problem?  Bohr’s  model  worked
beautifully,  correctly  predicting  the line spectrum  for
hydrogen.  It also worked  fine for ions with one electron,
such as He’, Li**, Be**, etc. The model failed, however,
when it was applied  to the emission  spectra  of atoms
that had more than one electron.  Bohr’s  model  needed
to be modified,  because  it was too simple  to explain  the
experimental  evidence.
Sublevels
The spectra  of many-electron  atoms suggested  that a
more complex  structure  was needed.  Notice  in Figure
D.1 that spectra  for these more complex  atoms have
groups  of lines close together.  The groups  are separated
by spaces.  The large spaces  represent  the energy  differ-
ences between  energy  levels,  while the smaller  spaces
represent  energy  differences  within  the levels.
If the electrons  are changing  energy  within  the
levels, this suggests  that there are sublevels  within  each
level, each with its own slightly  different  energy.  The
idea of energy  levels 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. remains,  but each
energy  level is split up into sublevels  called s, p, d,
and /f. Examine  Table D.1 to see how electrons  are
arranged  in sublevels  for energy  levels 1 to 4.

GETISIEX]  This figure shows  the relative  energies  of

But where do you find the electrons  in this new model?
How are the sublevels  oriented  in space?  Several
theories  enabled  scientists  to describe  what the newly
conceived  atom “looked  like.”
Particles  with Wave-Like  Properties
In 1924, Louis de Broglie, a young  physics  student,
suggested  that all matter  had wave-like  properties.  This
seemed  to follow  from Planck  and Einstein’s  idea that
electromagnetic  radiation  has matter-like  properties.
De Broglie  developed  an equation  that allowed  him to
calculate  the wavelength  of the matter  wave associated
with any object, from a bowling  ball to an electron.
Objects  that we can see and can interact  with have
calculated  wavelengths  that are smaller  than electrons.
Their wavelengths  are so tiny compared  to their size
that they do not have any measurable  effect on the
motion  of the objects.
For very tiny moving  particles,  however,  such as
electrons,  the wavelength  becomes  very significant.
In fact, an electron  moving  at an average  speed has a
wavelength  even larger than the size of the entire
hydrogen  atom!
De Broglie’s  theory  was proven  by experiment
when streams  of electrons  produced  diffraction  patterns
similar  to those produced  by electromagnetic  radiation,
which  was already  known  to travel in waves.
Orbitals
In 1926, Erwin Schrodinger  used de Broglie’s  idea that
matter  has wavelike  properties.  Schrédinger  proposed
what is now known  as the quantum  mechanical  model
of the atom. In this new model,  he abandoned  the
notion  of the electron  as a small particle  orbiting  the
nucleus.  Instead,  he took into account  the particle’s
wavelike  properties,  and described  the behaviour  of
electrons  in terms of wave functions.
The imprecise  nature of Schrédinger’s  model  was
supported  shortly  afterwards  by a principle  proposed  by
Werner  Heisenberg,  in 1927. Heisenberg  demonstrated
that it is impossible  to know both an electron’s  path-
way and its exact location.  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty
principle  is a mathematical  relationship  that shows  that
you can never know both the position  and the momen-
tum of an object  beyond  a certain  measure  of precision.
The momentum  of an object  is its mass multiplied  by its
velocity.  An object's  momentum  is directly  related  to the
amount  of energy  it has.
Expanding  the Model of the Atom * MHR_ 657
Heisenberg  also showed  that if you could know either
velocity  or position  precisely,  then the other property
would  be uncertain.  Therefore,  when talking  about
where electrons  are found in an atom, you cannot  talk
in terms of certainties,  but only in terms of probabilities.
Schrédinger  used a mathematical  wave equation
to define  the probability  of finding  an electron  within  an
atom. There are multiple  solutions  to this wave
equation  and Schrédinger  called these solutions  wave
functions,  or orbitals.  Each solution  provides  informa-
tion about the energy  and location  of an electron  within
an atom. Each orbital  has a specific  energy  associated
with it, and each contains  information  about where,
inside  the atom, the electrons  would  spend most of
their time. The actual paths of the moving  electrons
cannot  be determined.  However,  the solutions  can be
used to show where,  for each orbital,  there is a high
probability  of finding  an electron.
Imagine  you were able to take many exact measure-
ments of the position  of an electron  in the 1s sublevel
at fixed intervals.  At each second,  you would  mark the
electron’s  position  on a graph. After a while, your graph
might look something  like the first diagram  in Figure
D.4. If someone  tried to use your graph to determine
where  the electron  was, they would  not be able to state
its position  exactly.  They would,  however,  be able to
see that the probability  of finding  the electron  would  be
greater  near the nucleus  and would  decrease  farther
away from the nucleus.
The probability  graph is “fuzzy,”  because  the proba-
bility of finding  an electron  anywhere  in a 1s sublevel
is never zero. The probability  becomes  extremely  small
when it is far away from the nucleus,  but it never quite
reaches  zero. Therefore,  to obtain an exact shape for
an orbital,  you need to choose  a level of probability.
For example,  drawing  a contour  that encompasses
95 percent  of the probability  graph results  in a spherical
shape, like the third diagram  in Figure  D.4. In other
words,  at any time, there is a 95 percent  chance  of
finding  the electron  within  the spherical  contour.
These three figures  represent  the probability
of finding  an electron  at any point in a hydrogen  atom.
The two-dimensional  drawing  on the left shows  that the
electron  spends  most of its time fairly close to the nucleus.
The circle around  the cloud in the centre encompasses
95 percent  of the two-dimensional  cloud.  The diagram  on
the right shows  the 95 percent  probability  contour  in three
dimensions.
658 MHR - Appendix  DShapes  of Orbitals
The shapes  of the probability  graphs  from Schrédinger’s
wave functions  are the shapes  of the orbitals  in which
electrons  reside in atoms. You can visualize  orbitals  as
electron  clouds.  The shape of each cloud is based on
probability—it  tells you where the electron  spends
most of its time.
Examine  Figure  D.5. The s orbitals  are spherical  in
shape, as described  above. Each of these spherical  shells
contains  two electrons.  There are three p orbitals  for
each sublevel,  each with a capacity  for two electrons.
Each orbital  is shaped  something  like a dumbbell.  For
each sublevel,  the p orbitals  are oriented  along the x, y,
and z axes. Therefore,  the three p orbitals  in each sub-
level are sometimes  designated  with subscripts  to show
this. For example,  the 2p orbitals  may be designated
2px, 2Py, 2Pz-
2s
2py 2p
GETTAEX]  This figure shows  the shapes  of the 2s and 2p
orbitals.
The d and f orbitals  are quite complex  in shape. Each d
sublevel  contains  five d orbitals,  while each f sublevel
contains  seven  f orbitals.
Filling  the Orbitals
Why is it that each orbital  can contain  only two
electrons?  A hypothesis  suggests  that electrons  spin
around  their own axes as they move around  the nucle-
us, generating  magnetic  fields. They can spin either in
a positive  direction  or in a negative  direction.  In 1925,
Wolfgang  Pauli proposed  that only two electrons  of
opposite  spin could occupy  an orbital.  This idea became
known  as the Pauli exclusion  principle.
How do electrons  fill orbitals  within  atoms?  They do
so in such a way as to minimize  the potential  energy  of
the atom.
1. They will fill orbitals  with the lowest  energy  first.
The 1s orbital  will fill before  the 2s orbital,  which
will fill before  the 2p orbitals.
2. When occupying  two or more orbitals  with the same
energy  (for example,  any of the three 2p orbitals),
electrons  will half fill each orbital  until all are half
filled before adding  a second  electron  to each one.
This is called  Hund’s  rule.
You can show how electrons  fill orbitals,  using
superscripts.  For example,  a boron atom contains
five electrons.  Here’s  how you show the electron
configuration:
1s?2s?, 2px!
How would  you show the electron  configuration  of a
nitrogen  atom? Remember  Hund’s  rule:
1s”, 2s?, 2p,', 2py', 2pz'
Using the Model
The quantum  mechanical  model of the atom is useful
for explaining  phenomena  in addition  to emission
spectra.  For example,  in Chapter  2, you learned  about
trends  in ionization  energy.  You learned  that, in general,
ionization  energy  increases  across  a period.  Figure  D.6
shows the ionization  energy  as a function  of atomic
number  for the first 18 elements.  In most cases, the
ionization  energy  follows  the trend. There are some
exceptions,  however,  such as oxygen,  boron,  and sulfur.
You can use the quantum  model  of the atom to explain
these discrepancies.

(a) A completely  filled sublevel  is favourable  in terms
of energy.
(b) When removing  electrons  from the same sublevel,
it is easier  to remove  an electron  from  a filled orbital
than from  a half-filled  orbital. In spite of their
opposite  spins,  the negative  charges  of electrons
together  in a filled orbital repel each other more
than those in half-filled  orbitals.

Expanding  the Model of the Atom * MHR_ 659
Math and Chemistry
In chemistry,  quantities  and values are often very, very
large or very, very small. One mole of H,O contains  a
huge number  (602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000) of
molecules.  The mass of each molecule  is minuscule
(0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9 g). To calculate
the mass of one mole of H,O using the above data, you
multiply  the number  of molecules  in a mole by the mass
of an individual  molecule.  Imagine  doing this by hand:
602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000
x 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9g
18.0062045501  g
There is another  problem  with writing  all these zeros:
It implies  that they are all significant  digits. Yet the non-
final zeros to the right of the decimal  point in the mass
of an H,O molecule  are used as placeholders.  They are
not significant  digits. There are only three
significant  digits in
0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0299 g
Scientific  Notation
To simplify  reporting  large numbers  and doing calcula-
tions, you can use scientific  notation.  As you learned  in
an earlier  mathematics  course,  scientific  notation  works
by using powers  of 10 as multipliers.
The number  of particles  in one mole of a substance
(the Avogadro  constant)  is often rounded  down to
602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000. When performing
calculations,  however,  this number  is still too unwieldy.
To simplify  it, you can express  it as a number  between
1 and 10, multiplied  by factors  of 10. To do this, move
the decimal  point behind  the left-most  non-zero  digit,
counting  the number  of places  that the decimal  point
moves.  The number  of places  moved  is the exponent  for
the base 10.

first multiply.

This gives 18.0 x 10° g/mol. In scientific  notation,
however,  there must be only one digit before the deci-
mal place. Here the decimal  place must be moved  one
place to the left: 1.80 x 10’ g/mol.
Figure  E.3 shows  how to do this calculation  with a
scientific  calculator.  When you enter an exponent  on a
scientific  calculator,  you do not have to enter (x 10) at
any time.

(2.37 x 10% g) x (1.89 x 107 g)
= (2.37 x 1.89) x 10(7 +“)
= 4.4793 x 10° g > 4.48 x 10° g
e When dividing,  exponents  are subtracted
algebraically.
(9.23 x 10° L) = (4.11 x 107 L)
= (9.23 + 4.11) x 10(°~*)

e When adding  or subtracting  numbers  in scientific
notation,  the numbers  must be converted  to the same
power  of 10 as the measurement  with the greatest
power  of 10. Once the numbers  are all expressed  to
the same power  of 10, the power  of 10 is neither
added  nor subtracted  in the calculation.
(8.22 x 10* cm) + (5.66 x 10° cm)

Logarithms
Calculators  have made multiplication  and division  as
easy as adding  and subtracting.  Before calculators  were
invented,  however,  what did people  do? In 1614, John
Napier  (1550-1617)  invented  logarithms  to help people
multiply  and divide  large numbers.
Why do logarithms  make multiplication  and
division  easier?  Recall,  from the power  laws, how you
multiply  and divide  powers.  To multiply  powers  with
the same base, you add the exponents.  To divide  powers
with the same base, you subtract  the exponents.
Logarithms  are exponents.  Therefore,  to multiply
large numbers  using logarithms,  you simply  add the
logarithms.  To divide  large numbers  using logarithms,
you subtract  the logarithms.
Find the log (for “logarithm”)  key on your calcula-
tor. Enter 1000 or 10° into your calculator,  then press
the log key. The number  3 will be in the display.  Now
enter 10 000 or any other power  of 10. Press the log
key. What is displayed  for the log of the number?
(The logarithm  of any power  of 10 is just the exponent.)
How do you multiply  one million  by one billion,
or 10° x 10°, using logarithms?  You add the exponents,
or logarithms,  of these two numbers:  6 + 9 = 15. The
answer  is 10’°, a power of 10. This power is called the
antilogarithm  of the logarithm  15.
Logarithms  may not seem like a major discovery,
but John Napier  also evaluated  logarithms  for numbers
such as 2, 3, 5, and 764. (Table E.1 has more examples
of logarithms.)  Enter 2 into your calculator,  and press
the log key. The display  will show 0.3010,  to four
significant  digits. This means  that 10°%°!°  = 2. Repeat
to find the log of 3. The display  will show 0.4771.  This
means  that 10°77! = 3.
You know that 2 x 3 = 6. If you add 0.3010  to
0.4771,  you get 0.7781.  What is 10°778'?  Enter 0.7781
into your calculator.  Find the 10* key. (Usually  it is
above the log key, as a second  function.)  Press the 10*key. If you round  the answer  in the display,  you will
get 6.
Find the log of 8 and the log of 4. You know
that 8 + 4 = 2. Subtract  the log of 4 from the log of
8: 0.9031  — 0.6021 = 0.3010.  This answer  is the log
of 2: 199-9931  + 199-6021  _ 199-3010  = 2. Evaluate  199-3010
on your calculator  by typing  in 0.3010  and using the
10* key.
Technology LINK
Logarithms  were used for 350 years to do many complex
calculations.  Even today, calculators  are programmed  to
do mathematical  manipulations  with logarithms.  So, indi-
rectly, we are still using John Napier’s  invention.
Table E.1 Some Numbers  and Their Logarithms

Notice  that numbers  above 1 correspond  to logarithms
whose  value is positive;  numbers  below 1 correspond
to logarithms  whose  value is negative.  Over the years,
scientists  have found logarithms  convenient  for more
than calculations.  Logarithms  can be used to express
values  that span a range of powers  of 10, such as pH.
In Chapter  10, section  10.2, concentrations  of acids
are discussed.  The pH of an acid solution  is defined
as —log[H;0*].  (The square  brackets  mean “concentra-
tion.”) For example,  suppose  that the hydronium
ion concentration  in a solution  is 0.0001 mol/L
(10* mol/L).  The pH is —log(0.0001).  To calculate  this,
enter 0.0001 into your calculator.  Then press the log
key. Since the logarithm  is negative,  press the key.
The answer  in the display  is 4. Therefore  the pH of
the solution  is 4.
As stated above,  there are logarithms  for all
numbers,  not just whole  multiples  of 10. What is the pH
of a solution  if [H,0*] = 0.00476  mol/L?  Enter 0.00476.
Press the log key and then the key. The answer  is
2.322. Remember  that the concentration  was expressed
to three significant  digits. The pH to three significant
digits is 2.32.
What if you want to find the [H;0*] from the pH?
You would need to find 10-P#. For example,  what is the
[H;O*] if the pH is 5.78? Enter 5.78, and press the
key. Then use the 10* function.  The answer  is 10~°’”®.
Therefore,  the [H;0*] is 1.66 x 10 mol/L.
Remember  that the pH scale is a negative  log scale.
Thus, a decrease  in pH from pH  7 to pH4 is an increase
of 10%, or 1000, in the acidity  of a solution.  An increase
from pH 3 to pH  6 is a decrease  of 10°, or 1000, in
acidity.

Linear Graphs
Suppose  that you conduct  a Boyle’s  law experiment.
(See Chapter  11, section  11.2.) You obtain data that are
similar  to the data in Table E.2.
Table E.2 Boyle’s  Law Data
1/Pressure  (kPa) | Volume (mL)

6.13 x 10° 30.7
Looking  at the data does not tell you much about the
relationship  between  the two variables:  the volume  (V)
and the inverse  pressure  G). What if you graph the
data? Put W (the independent  variable)  on the x-axis.
Put V (the dependent  variable)  on the y-axis. The scale
for 7 should go from 0 to at least 0.01. The scale for V
should  go from 0 to at least 50.0. To plot each point, go
662 MHR - Appendix  Ealong the x-axis until you reach the value of 3 (such as
0.01). Then go up from this point to the corresponding
value of V (50.0). After you have plotted  all the points,
draw the line of best fit through  the points. (See Figures
E.4A and E.4B).

Examine  the graph in Figure  E.4B. You can see that the
points  form  a straight  line that goes through  the origin,
(0,0). You can also see that there is a linear relationship
between  the volume  and the inverse  pressure.
Mathematically,  this means  that the volume  is
directly  proportional  to the inverse  pressure,  or V « +
To remove  the proportionality  sign and replace  it with
an equal sign, V must be multiplied  by a proportionality
constant,  k.

What happens  if the data do not give a line that goes
through  the origin?  The data in Table E.3 came from
an experiment  to determine  the density  of an unknown
liquid. The student  forgot to measure  the mass of the
container  that was used to hold the various  volumes
of the liquid.

|FigureE.5 |These data are plotted,  as shown  in Figure  E.5, with
the volume  on the x-axis and the mass on the y-axis.
The equation  of this line is in the form y = mx + b,
where  m is the slope of the line and  b is the y-intercept.
(The y-intercept  is the value of y where  the line crosses
the y-axis. This value occurs  when x = 0.) Thus, the
relationship  here is m = kV + b, where  the k is the slope
of the line. As before,

Therefore,  the equation  of the line is m = 0.668V  + b.
If there is no liquid,  both the mass and the volume  of
the liquid are zero. Notice,  however,  that there is still a
value for mass on the graph. This is the value of b, the
y-intercept,  which  is 43.8 g. It represents  the mass of
the container.  Therefore,  the final equation  is
m = 0.668V  + 43.8.
Consider  one more example.  Two different  sets of
data for Charles’  law experiments  are given in Table E.4.
Table E.4 Charles’  Law Data

The linear graphs  of both sets of data are given in
Figure  E.6, on the same pair of axes. Since two different
samples  of gas were used, there are two different  lines
in the form y = mx + b. Notice  that the lines intersect  at
—273°C,  or 0 K, the theoretical  lowest  temperature  possi-
ble. (The linear  graphs  for the temperature  and volume
of all gases go through  this point.)  If the y-axis was
moved  to this point and a new origin was established
here, then the equations  for the lines would  be in the
form y = mx. This is what happens  when you convert
temperatures  to the Kelvin  scale.

The Unit Analysis
Method  of Problem  Solving
The unit analysis  method  of problem  solving  is
extremely  versatile.  You can use it to convert  between
units or to solve simple  formula  problems.  If you forget
a formula  during  a test, you may still be able to solve
the problem  using unit analysis.
The unit analysis  method  involves  analyzing  the
units and setting  up conversion  factors.  You match and
arrange  the units so that they divide out to give the
desired  unit in the answer.  Then you multiply  and
divide  the numbers  that correspond  with the units.
664 MHR= Appendix  ESteps for Solving  Problems
Using Unit Analysis
Step 1 Determine  which data you have and which  con-
version  factors  you need to use. (A conversion
factor is usually  a ratio of two numbers  with
units, such as 1000 g/1 kg. You multiply  the given
data by the conversion  factor to get the desired
units in the answer.)  It is often convenient  to
use the following  three categories  to set up your
solution:  Have, Need, and Conversion  Factors.
Step 2 Arrange  the data and conversion  factors  so that
you can cross out the undesired  units. Decide
whether  you need any additional  conversion  fac-
tors to get the desired  units in the answer.
Step 3 Multiply  all the numbers  on the top of the ratio.
Then multiply  all the numbers  on the bottom  of
the ratio. Divide  the top result by the bottom
result.
Step 4 Check  that the units have cancelled  correctly.
Also check  that the answer  seems reasonable,
and that the significant  digits are correct.

What mass of oxygen,  Oz, can be obtained  by the
decomposition  of 5.0 g of potassium  chlorate,
KC1O3?  The balanced  equation  is given below.

What Is Required?
You need to calculate  the amount  of oxygen,  in
grams, that is produced  by the decomposition  of
5.0 g of potassium  chlorate.
What Is Given?
You know the mass of potassium  chlorate  that
decomposes.
Mass = 5.0 g
From the balanced  equation,  you can obtain the
molar ratio of the reactant  and the product.

Use the molar ratio to find the number  of moles of
