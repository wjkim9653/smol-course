Scientists have been able to gather information about atoms without actually seeing
them. Perform the following activity to get an idea about the structure of the atom.
Take an onion. It looks solid. Peel off a layer, and you will find another layer
underneath. Layer after layer surfaces as the onion is peeled off. Keep on peeling
to its core.
Analysis
1. How do you compare this with the atomic model?
2. What do the layers represent in the atomic model?
3. What does the core represent in the atom?
Two thousand years ago, ancient Greek philosophers developed a theory of matter
that was not based on the experimental evidences. A notable Greek philosopher,
namely, Democritus, believed that all matter was composed of very tiny, indivisible
particles. He called them atomos. Hence, the word ‘atom’ came from the Greek word
atomos, which means uncuttable or indivisible.
Aristotle was part of the generation that succeeded Democritus. He did not believe in
atomos. Aristotle thought that all matter was continuous. That is, if one proceeded on
breaking down a substance, it would be impossible to reach to the last indivisible
particle. In other words, 1t would continue to divide infinitely. His opinion was
accepted for nearly 200 years.
The early concept of atoms was simply a result of thinking and reasoning on the part
of the philosophers, instead of experimental observations. In 1803, however, John
Dalton proposed a completely different theory of matter. His theory was based on
scientific experimental observations and logical laws. These scientific assumptions were

very closely related to what is presently known about the atom. Due to this, John
Dalton is often referred to as the father of modern atomic theory.
Dalton also worked on the relative masses of atoms and gave symbols to some
elements as illustrated in Figure 1.1.
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ describe Dalton’s atomic theory;
¢ describe modern atomic theory; and
* compare and contrast Dalton’s atomic theory with modern atomic theory.
Activity 1.1
Form a group and discuss the following idea: Dalton’s contribution was different from that
of the ancient Greeks who postulated the existence of atoms. Point out the differences
between the two ideas. Present your discussion to the class.
Even though the idea of the existence of atoms and atomic theory dates back to
classical times, as discussed earlier, only Dalton's atomic theory ideas were the basis
for the new era of science.
British physicist and chemist John Dalton is best known for
developing the atomic theory of elements and molecules, the
foundation of modern physical science. While pondering the
nature of the atmosphere during a meteorological study in the
early 1800s, Dalton deduced the structure of carbon dioxide and
proposed that an exact number of atoms constitute each
molecule. He held that all atoms of a given element are identical
and different from the atoms of every other element. The first to
John Dalton
classify elements according to their atomic weights, Dalton set
the stage for a revolution in scientific thought.
@ chemisteyrave9
In 1804, John Dalton developed the first modern theory of atoms and proposed their
existence. Dalton's atomic theory was based directly on the ideas of elements and
compounds, and on the three laws of chemical combination. The three laws are:
i) The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor
destroyed. This law is also called the law of indestructibility of matter. It means
that the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the mass of the products in
any chemical reaction. A chemical reaction involves only the separation and union
of atoms.
ii) The law of definite proportions states that a pure compound is always
composed of the same elements combined in a definite ratio by mass. For
example, water (H,O) is composed of hydrogen and oxygen only. These elements
are always in the proportion of 11.19% hydrogen to 88.81% oxygen by mass
and in the proportion 2 : 1 by volume.
iii) The law of multiple proportions states that when two different compounds are
formed from the same elements, the masses of one of the elements in the two
compounds, compared to a given mass of the other element, is in a small whole-
number ratio. For example, carbon and oxygen form two compounds: carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide contains 1.3321 g of oxygen
for each | g of carbon, whereas carbon dioxide contains 2.6642 g of oxygen
for each 1g of carbon. Hence, carbon dioxide contains twice the mass of oxygen
as does carbon monoxide.
Activity 1.2
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Using two chemical compounds as an example, describe the difference between the law
of definite proportions and the law of multiple proportions.
Dalton proved that these laws are entirely reasonable if the elements are composed of
tiny particles, which he called atoms. An atom is the smallest fundamental particle of
an element.
The basic postulates of Dalton’s Atomic Theory are summarized as follows:
1. All elements are made up of small particles called atoms.
2. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.
3. All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and in all other properties.
4. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.
5. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine.
6. In a given compound, the relative numbers and types of atoms are constant.
srRUCTUREOFTHEATOM
Although some of these postulates, like postulate number 2 and number 3, have been
shown to be incorrect by later work, Dalton's theory was a brilliant and logical
explanation of many experimental discoveries and laws that were known at that time.
Activity 1.3
Form a group. Discuss the following laws and present to the class.
Use Dalton’s atomic theory to explain:
a_ The law of conservation of mass
b The law of definite proportions
c_ The law of multiple proportions.
Towards the end of the 19th century, various experimental discoveries revealed the
existence of subatomic particles, isotopes, and so on. In light of these findings,
Dalton's Atomic Theory was modified.
The Modern Atomic Theory can be summarized as follows:
1. Atoms are the smallest particles of all elements that can take part in a chemical
reaction.
2. An atom is divisible. It can be subdivided into electrons, protons, and neutrons.
An atom is also indestructible i.e., atoms can neither be created nor destroyed
during ordinary chemical reactions.
3. Atoms of the same element may not be identical in mass because of the existence
of isotopes.
4. Atoms of the same elements have identical chemical properties.
Atoms of different elements have different chemical properties.
6. Atoms of two or more elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form
compounds.
Exercise 1.1
Name the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory.
2. Compare and contrast Dalton’s atomic theory with modern atomic theory.

Activity 1.4
Form a group and discuss the following ideas. Present your discussion to the rest of the
class.
1. In your grade 7 chemistry lesson, you have learned that atoms consist of three
fundamental subatomic particles. What are these? Where is their location in the atoms?
What are their charges?
2. What were the consequences of the discoveries of subatomic particles on Dalton’s
atomic theory?
In the late 1880’s, John Dalton thought atoms were indivisible. However, a series of
investigations and astounding discoveries clearly demonstrated that atoms are made up
of smaller particles, called subatomic particles. The three fundamental subatomic
particles of an atom are electrons, protons, and neutrons.
Do you think that there is a similarity between cathode rays and electrons?
The electron was the first subatomic particle to be identified. In 1879, William
Crooke studied electrical discharges in partially evacuated tubes called
discharge tubes.
Two electrodes from a high-voltage source are sealed into a glass tube from which air
has been evacuated. The negative electrode is the cathode and the positive one is the
anode. When the high-voltage current is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenish
light and a beam of light is seen at the anode. These rays flow from the cathode
towards the anode in a straight line. They are called cathode rays. Later on, in 1897,
J.J. Thomson found that the beam was deflected by both electrical and magnetic
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM umm
fields. In an electric field, they bend toward the positive plate. From this he concluded
that the cathode rays are made up of very small negatively charged particles, which he
named electrons. He concluded that electrons are constituents of all matter, because
he obtained the same results when he changed the gas and the electrode in the tube.

Cathode rays possess the following properties:
I. An object placed between the cathode and the opposite end of the tube,
casts a shadow on the glass. This shows that the cathode rays travel in a
straight line.
2. A paddle wheel placed in the path of cathode rays rotates. This indicates that
cathode rays are of particle nature-the particles strike the paddle and therefore
move the wheel.

3. When an electric or magnetic field is applied in the path of cathode rays, they
are deflected towards the positive plate. This shows that cathode rays are
negatively charged.
@ cHemistaveraDES
4. The properties of cathode rays (like charge to mass ratio, e-/m ratio) do not
depend on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube or on the material of the
cathode. This shows that electrons are present in the atoms of all elements.
Thus, cathode-ray experiments provided evidence that atoms are divisible into small
particles, and that one of the atom’s basic constituents is the negatively charged
particle called electron.
PROJECT WORK
Produce a model of cathode ray tube from simple and locally available materials
such as glass tube, copper wire and rubber stoppers. Using your model show how
cathode rays are generated and explain their properties.
Charge and Mass of an Electron
J.J. Thomson studied the deflection of cathode rays under the simultaneous application
of electric and magnetic fields, that are applied perpendicular to each other. His
experiment led to the precise determination of the charge-to-mass ratio (e7/m) of an
electron, and this ‘e-/m’ value was found to be 1.76 x 10% coulomb/g. Coulomb is a
unit of electric charge.
Activity 1.5
Form a group and discuss how J.J Thomson's determination of the charge-to-mass ratio of
the electron led to the conclusion that atoms were composed of sub atomic particles.
Present your findings to the class.
In 1909, Robert Millikan determined the charge of an electron (e-), using the oil drop
experiment. He found the charge of an electron to be 1.60 x 10-!° coulombs.
Combination of e/m and e~ values are used to determine the mass of an electron,
which is found to be 9.11 < 1073! kg.
From Thomson’s experiment, e-/m = 1.76 x 10° C/g
From Millikan’s experiment, e~ = 1.60 x 10°! C

From the above discussion, it follows that:
An electron is a fundamental particle of an atom carrying a negative charge and having
a very small mass. The mass of an electron is approximately 1837 times the mass
of a hydrogen atom.

Exercise 1.2
1. Explain how the electron was discovered.
2. Give explanation on the works of J.J. Thomson and R. Millikan.
Radioactivity
In 1895, the German physicist, Wilhelm R6ntgen noticed that cathode rays caused
glass and metals to emit very unusual rays. This highly energetic radiation penetrated
matter, darkened covered photographic plates, and caused a variety of substances to
fluoresce. Since these rays could not be deflected by a magnet, they could not contain
charged particles as cathode rays do. R6ntgen called them X-rays.
Not long after R6ntgen’s discovery, Antoine Becquerel, a professor of physics in
Paris, began to study fluorescent properties of substances. He found that exposing
thickly wrapped photographic plates to a certain uranium compound caused them to
darken, even without the stimulation of cathode rays. Like X-rays, the rays from the
uranium compound were highly energetic and could not be deflected by a magnet.
Also, these rays were generated spontaneously. One of Becquerel's students, Marie
Curie, suggested the name radioactivity to describe this spontaneous emission of
particles and/or radiation. Consequently, any element that spontaneously emits
radiation is said to be radioactive.
Further investigation revealed that three types of rays are produced by the “decay”, or
breakdown of radioactive substances such as uranium, polonium, and radium. These
are alpha, beta, and gamma rays.
Alpha () rays consist of positively charged particles called a-particles. They are
deflected by positively charged plates. Beta ({) rays or {-particles are electrons of
nuclear origin that are deflected by negatively charged plates. The third type of
radioactive radiation consists of high-energy rays called gamma (y) rays. Like X-rays,
y-rays have no charge and are not affected by an external electric or magnetic field.
Activity 1.6
Form a group and discuss the following ideas. Present your discussion to the class.
Scientists discovered the three subatomic particles (electrons, protons and neutrons).
Compare and contrast these fundamental sub atomic particles with alpha particles, beta
particles and gamma rays in terms of the nature of the particles.
More details about the structure of an atom were provided in 1911 by Ernest
Rutherford and his associates, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The scientists
@ cemisteyrave9
bombarded a thin gold foil with fast moving alpha particles. Alpha particles are positively
charged particles with about four times the mass of a hydrogen atom. Geiger and
Marsden assumed that mass and charge were uniformly distributed throughout the atoms
of the gold foil. Therefore, they expected the alpha particles to pass through the gold foil
with only a slight deflection. However, when the scientists checked for the possibility of
wide-angle deflections, they were shocked to find that roughly 1 in 8000 of the alpha
particles had actually been redirected back toward the source.
After thinking about the observations for two years, Rutherford finally came up with
an explanation. He reasoned that the rebounded alpha particles must have
experienced some powerful force within the atom. He concluded that the source of
this force must occupy a very small amount of space because very few of the total
number of alpha particles had been affected by it. He also concluded that the force
must be caused by a very densely packed bundle of matter with a positive electric
charge. Rutherford called this small, dense, positrve bundle of matter the nucleus.

Rutherford’s Conclusion
1. Since most of the o-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected, most of
the space in an atom is empty.
2. Some of the c-particles were deflected by small angles. This indicated the presence
of a heavy positive centre in the atom, which Rutherford named the nucleus.
3. Only a few particles (1 in about a million) were either deflected by a very large
angle or deflected back. This confirmed that the space occupied by the heavy
positive centre must be very small.
Activity 1.7
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Predict what Rutherford might have observed if he had bombarded copper metal instead
of gold metal with alpha particles.
From the angles through which alpha particles are deflected, Rutherford calculated
that the nucleus of an atom has a radius of about 10-! m. The radius of the whole
atom is about 10-!° m. Therefore, the nucleus is about 1/10,000 (one ten-thousandth)
of the size of the atom as a whole. Thus, if we magnified an atom to the size of a
football stadium (about 100 m across), the nucleus would be represented by a pea
placed at the centre of the pitch.
Rutherford suggested that the negatively charged electrons surrounding the positively
charged nucleus are like planets around the sun revolving. He could not explain,
however, what kept the electrons in motion around the nucleus.
In 1932, an English scientist, James Chadwick, identified the existence of neutrons.
He bombarded a thin foil of beryllium with o-particles of a radioactive substance. He
then observed that highly penetrating rays, consisting of electrically neutral particles of
a mass approximately equal to that of the proton, were produced. These neutral
particles are called neutrons.
A neutron is a subatomic particle carrying no charge and having a mass of 1.675 x
10-*4 g. This mass is almost equal to that of a proton or of a hydrogen atom.
Exercise 1.3
1. Which experimental evidence indicates that:
i) electrons are negatively charged particles?
ii) electrons are the constituents of all atoms?
2. In Rutherford’s experiment, most of the alpha particles passed through the
gold foil undeflected. What does this indicate?
3. In Rutherford’s experiment, some of the c-particles were deflected by small
angles. What does this indicate?
What was determined from Millikan’s oil drop experiment?
5. Three particles are fired into a box that is positively charged on one side and
negatively charged on the other side. The result is shown in Figure 1.5.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. It is the fuel for the sun and
other stars. It is currently believed that there are roughly 2,000 times more hydrogen
atoms than oxygen atoms. There are also 10,000 times more hydrogen atoms than carbon
atoms.

All atoms have two regions. The nucleus is a very small region located at the center of
an atom. Except for the nucleus of the simplest type of hydrogen atom, all atomic
nuclei are made of two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons. Surrounding the
nucleus, there is a region occupied by negatively charged particles called electrons.
This region is very large compared with the size of the nucleus. A proton has a
positive charge, which is equal in magnitude to the negative charge of an electron.
Atoms are electrically neutral because they contain equal numbers of protons and
electrons.

A proton has a mass of 1.673 x 10-2” kg, and a neutron has a mass of 1.675 x 10°
kg. Hence, protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass. Most of the
mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus, assuming the mass of an electron to
be negligible or almost zero.

Physicists have identified other subatomic particles. But particles other than
electrons, protons, and neutrons have little effect on the chemical properties of
matter. Table 1.1 gives a summary of the properties of electrons, protons, and
neutrons. (The relative electric charge, relative mass, and actual mass are discussed in
the next section.)

It is convenient to think of the region occupied by the electrons as an electron cloud,
a cloud of negative charge. The radius of an atom is the distance from the center of
the nucleus to the outer portion of this electron cloud. This is about 107!° m = 100
pm = 0.1 nm. Because atomic radii are so small, they are expressed using a unit that
is specifically convenient for the sizes of atoms. This unit can be picometer, nanometer,
micrometer, etc. The abbreviation for the
picometer is pm (1 pm = 107! m = 107! cm)
nanometer is nm (1 nm = 10° m = 1077 cm)
micrometer is um (lum = 10° m = 10% cm)

All atoms are composed of the same basic particles. Yet all atoms are not the same.
Atoms of different elements have different number of protons. Atoms of the same
element have the same number of protons.
The Atomic Number (Z) of an element is equal to the number of protons in the
nucleus of an atom. It is also equal to the number of electrons in the neutral atom.
Z=p or Z=e (ina natural atom)
For different elements, the nuclei of their atoms differ in the number of protons they
contain. Therefore, they differ in the amount of positive charge that their atoms
possess. Thus, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines the identity
of an atom.
Each atom of an element is identified by its atomic number. In the periodic table, the
atomic number of an element is indicated below its symbol. Notice that the elements
are placed in order of increasing atomic number. Hydrogen, H, has atomic number 1,
hence, atoms of the element hydrogen have one proton in the nucleus. Next is helium,
He, which has two protons in its nucleus. Lithium, Li, has three protons. Beryllium,
Be, has four protons, and so on.
Mass Number (A) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of
an atom. Collectively, the protons and neutrons of an atom are called its nucleons.
Mass Number (4) = Number of protons + Number of neutrons
The name of an element, its atomic number and mass number can be represented by
a shorthand symbol. For example, to represent neutral atoms of magnesium with 12
protons and 12 neutrons, the symbol is Mg. The atomic number is written as a
subscript to the left of the symbol of magnesium. The mass number is written as a
superscript to the left of the symbol. This method can be represented in general by
the following illustration, in which X stands for any chemical symbol.
Mass Number x or A 4
Atomic Number Z,
24 . . 25
Mg can be read as “Magnesium-24”, and “Magnesium-25” represents Mg. In a
12 12
23
similar manner, Na can be read as “Sodium-23”.
The number of neutrons in an atom is found by subtracting the atomic number from
the mass number. For example, the number of neutrons for a silver atom (')SAg) is:
Mass number — Atomic number = Number of neutrons
108 — 47 = 61
The number of neutrons is 61.
Example 1
How many protons, electrons, and neutrons are found in an atom of bromine-80
if its atomic number is 35?
Solution:
Atomic number of bromine is 35.
Mass number of bromine is already given as 80. Now we can write bromine,
Br in the form of:
7X as 3Br = Br
Mass number — Atomic number = Number of neutrons
80 — 35 = 45 neutrons
For a neutral atom: number of protons = number of electrons = atomic number.
Number of protons = Number of electrons = 35

The simplest atoms are those of hydrogen. Each hydrogen atom contains one proton
only. However, hydrogen atoms contain different numbers of neutrons.
Three types of hydrogen atoms are known. The most common type of hydrogen is
called protium. It accounts for 99.985% of the hydrogen atoms found on Earth. The
nucleus of a protium atom consists of one proton only, and it has one electron moving
around it. The second form of hydrogen atom is called deuterium, which accounts for
0.015% of the Earth's hydrogen atoms. Each deuterium atom has a nucleus containing

one proton and one neutron. The third form of hydrogen atom is known as tritium,
and it is radioactive. It exists in very small amounts in nature, but it can be prepared
artificially. Each trittum atom contains one proton and two neutrons. Protium,
deuterium and tritium are the three isotopes of hydrogen.
Isotopes are the atoms of the same element that have the same atomic number but different
masses number. The isotopes of a particular element have the same number of protons and
electrons but different number of neutrons. Isotopes of an element may occur naturally, or
they may be made in the laboratory (artificial isotopes). Since isotopes have the same
number of protons and electrons, they have the same chemical properties.
Designating Isotopes
Isotopes are usually identified by specifying their mass number. There are two
methods for specifying isotopes. In the first method, the mass number is written
with a hyphen after the name of the element. Tritium, for example, is written as
Hydrogen-3. We will refer to this method as hyphen notation. The second method for
@ cHemistaysraDes
designating an isotope is by indicating its isotopic nuclear composition. For example,
Hydrogen-3 is written as *H. The following table illustrates this designation of
isotopes for hydrogen and helium.

Relative Atomic Masses
Actual masses of atoms, measured in grams, are very small. An atom of oxygen-16,
for example, has a mass of 2.657 x 10-*3g. For most chemical calculations, it is more
convenient to use relative atomic masses. In order to set up a relative scale of atomic
mass, one atom has been arbitrarily chosen as the standard and assigned a relative mass
value. The masses of all other atoms are expressed in terms of this defined standard.
The standard used by scientists to determine units of atomic mass is the carbon-12
atom. It has been arbitrarily assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units, or 12
a.m.u. One atomic mass unit, or | a.m.u, is exactly 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12
atom, or 1.660 x 10°*4 g. The atomic mass of any atom is determined by
comparing it with the mass of the carbon-12 atom. The hydrogen-1 atom has an
atomic mass of about 1/12 of that of the carbon-12 atom, or about 1 a.m.u. The
precise value of the atomic mass of a hydrogen-1 atom is 1.007 a.m.u. An oxygen-
16 atom has about 16/12 (or 4/3 the mass of a carbon-12 atom). Careful
measurements show the atomic mass of oxygen-16 to be 15.994 a.m.u. The mass
of a magnesium-24 atom is found to be slightly less than twice that of a carbon-12
atom. Its atomic mass is 23.985 a.m.u.
srUCTUREe OFTHE ATOM
The masses of subatomic particles can also be expressed on the atomic-mass scale.
The mass of an electron is 0.0005486 a.m.u, that of the proton is 1.007276 a.m.u,
and that of the neutron is 1.008665 a.m.u. Note that the proton and neutron masses
are close to 1 a.m.u but not equal to 1 a.m.u. You have learned that the mass number
is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. You can now
see that the mass number and relative atomic mass of a given nucleus are quite close
to each other. They are not identical because the proton and neutron masses deviate
slightly from 1 a.m.u.

Present your model to the class.
Average Atomic Masses of Elements
Most elements occur naturally as mixtures of isotopes, as shown in the examples in
Table 1.3. The percentage of each isotope in the naturally occurring elements is nearly
always the same, no matter where the element is found. The percentage at which each
isotope of an element occurs in nature is taken into account when calculating the
average atomic mass of the element. Average atomic mass is the weighted average of
the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of an element.

The average atomic mass of an element is calculated by summing up the products of
relative atomic mass and percentage abundance of each isotope and dividing by 100.

Activity 1.16
Discuss the following concept in groups and present your conclusion to the class. Have
you heard the word “model” in your everyday life? Car makers produce different models as
time passes. What is your understanding about the atomic model?
Atoms are too small to be observed directly. Hence, it is better to develop a tentative
mental picture (mode!) of the atomic concept. The ideas about atoms have changed
mx€
many times. But, at present we can reduce these ideas into five models: Dalton’s
Model, Thomson’s Model, Rutherford’s Model, Bohr’s Model, and the Quantum
Mechanical Model.
1) Dalton’s Atomic Model
This model of atoms was accepted for 100 years without serious challenge. He
thought of atoms as solid indestructible spheres. He called it the billiard ball model.
Figure 1.7 Dalton’s model of an atom.
ii) Thomson Model
After learning that atoms contain electrons, Thomson proposed a new model of the
atom, which is shown in Figure 1.8. It is sometimes called the plum-pudding model. In
his model of an atom, Thomson proposed thought that electrons were embedded
inside a positively charged sphere, just like plums in a pudding. Today we might call
Thomson’s model the chocolate chip ice-cream model.

Activity 1.17
Perform the following tasks in groups and present your findings to the class.
1. Draw a sketch diagram of a carbon atom using Thomson's atomic model.
2. What was incorrect about Thomson's model of the atom?
tii) Rutherford Model
Why was Thomson’s model of atom discarded and replaced by
Rutherford’s model?
srRUCTUREOFTHEATOM
By 1911, evidence was collected that allowed scientists to modify Thomson’s model
of an atom. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), a former student of Thomson, performed
one of the classic experiments of scientific history. As indicated earlier in this unit, he
bombarded different types of matter with high-energy, positively charged alpha
particles. Based on the Thomson’s model of an atom, Rutherford hypothesized that
the alpha particles should go through very thin metal foils undeflected. However, after
performing an experiment on gold leaf, he found that a small but significant number of
the alpha particles were deflected through large angles by the gold atoms. These
results showed Rutherford that the Thomson model of the atom was not valid. A
uniform positive charge with embedded negatively charged electrons would not
interact with the alpha particles in such a manner.
The Rutherford model of the atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus
around which electrons whirl at high speeds and at relatively long distances from it.
He compared the structure of an atom with the solar system, saying that the nucleus
corresponds to the sun, while the electrons correspond to the planets. This picture of
the atom is also called the planetary atom. In other words, Rutherford gave us the
nuclear model of the atom.
Even though Rutherford showed that the atom has a nucleus, he did not know how
the electrons were arranged outside the nucleus. This was the major drawback of
Rutherford’s model of an atom.
Figure 1.9 Rutherford model.
A Nobel Prize winner, Niels Bohr, was known not only for his
own theoretical work, but also as a mentor to younger physicists
who themselves made important contributions to physical
theory. As the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at
the University of Copenhagen, Bohr gathered together some of
the finest minds in the physics community, including Werner
Heisenberg and George Gawow. During the 1920's, the Institute
was the source of many important works in quantum mechanics
and in theoretical physics in general.
Niels Bohr
md _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
iv) Bohr Model
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) proposed an atomic model in
which the electrons moved around the nucleus in circular paths called orbits. He
assumed the electrons to be moving around the nucleus in a circular orbit as the
planets move around the sun. Based on the Rutherford's atomic model, Bohr made
the following modifications.
¢ The electrons in an atom can exist only in a restricted number of stable orbits
with energy levels in which they neither absorb nor emit energy. These orbits
designated by a number called the principal quantum number, n. The principal
quantum number has the values of 1, 2, 3, . . . The energy levels are also called
shells. They are represented by K, L, M, . . . etc. The K-shell is the first shell,
the L-shell is the second shell, the M-shell is the third shell, etc.
¢ When an electron moves between orbits it absorbs or emits energy. When an
electron jumps from lower to higher states it absorbs a fixed amount of energy.
When an electron falls from a higher (excited) state to a lower (ground) state it
emits a fixed amount of energy.
¢ The electrons move around the nucleus in energy levels.
Figure 1.10 The first six energy levels in the Bohr model of an atom.
¢ According to Bohr, for each element, the number of energy levels or shells is
fixed. Also, each different energy level or shell of an atom can only accommodate
a certain number of electrons. The maximum number of electrons that the main
energy level can have is given by the general formula 2n’, where n is equal to
the main energy level.
Therefore, the maximum number of electrons in each shell in the Bohr model is:
first energy level (n = 1) is 2(1)* =2 electrons
second energy level (nm = 2) is 2(2)* = 8 electrons
third energy level (n = 3) is 2(3)* = 18 electrons
fourth energy level (n = 4) is 2(4)* = 32 electrons
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM >
It can also be summarized in the form of Table 1.4.
Table 1.4 Energy levels and electrons for the first four main energy levels.

L M N
2 8 18 32
¢ When electrons fill the various energy levels in an atom, they first occupy the
Shell with the lowest energy level. When the lowest energy level is filled, according
to the 27° rule, then the electrons enter the next higher energy level.
The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than eight electrons, even
if it has the capacity to hold more electrons. This is because having more than eight
electrons in the outermost shell makes the atom unstable.
For example, let us write the electron configuration of magnesium that has 12
electrons. The first 2 electrons occupy the K-shell (the first energy level). The L-shell
(the second energy level) is occupied with 8 electrons. The remaining 2 electrons
enter the M-shell (the third energy level). Hence, the electron configuration of
magnesium atom becomes * § %.

Note that p = proton, 7 = neutron, and @ = electron.

)etas Nitrogen (atomic number = 7)
mo Sulphur (atomic number = 16)
OQ Potassium (atomic number = 19)
noi Calcium (atomic number = 20)
v) The Quantum Mechanical Model
During the 1920’s, the discovery of the wave-like properties of electrons led to the
wave-mechanical model or quantum-mechanical model of atoms. In this model, the
electrons are associated with definite energy levels, but their locations cannot be
pinpointed. Instead, they are described in terms of the probability of being found in
certain regions of space about the nucleus. These regions of space are called orbitals.
An orbital is a particularly shaped volume of space where the probability of finding an
electron is at a maximum.
According to this model, the electrons in an atom are in a series of energy levels or
shells. Each energy level or shell is described by a number called the principal
quantum number, ”, which is related to the size of the energy level. The larger the
energy value of 1, the farther the electrons are found from the nucleus.
The quantum mechanical model introduces the concept of sublevel for each main
energy level. For atoms of the known elements, there are four types of sublevels
designated by the letters s, p, d, and f The number of sublevels within each energy
level or shell is equal to the numerical value of 7.

6 P 6 (s,p,d,f,g,h) 72
Any orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. Accordingly,
s-sublevel has only | orbital and can hold a maximum of 2 electrons,
p-sublevel has 3 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 6 electrons,
d-sublevel has 5 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 10 electrons, and
J-sublevel has 7 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 14 electrons.
Electron Configurations
The arrangement of electrons in an atom is known as the electron configuration of the
atom. Because atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons, a
distinct electronic configuration exists for the atoms of each element. Like all systems
in nature, electrons in atoms tend to assume arrangements that have the lowest
possible energies. The lowest energy arrangement of the electrons in an atom is called
the ground state electron configuration. A few simple rules, combined with the
quantum number relationships discussed below, allow us to determine these ground-
state electron configurations.
The quantum mechanical model is designated by the following notation: a coefficient
which shows the main energy level, a letter that denotes the sublevel that an electron
occupies, and a superscript that shows the number of electrons in that particular
sublevel.
The designation is explained as follows
2 <——— Number of electrons
1s
te steve

@ cHemistaveraDES
For example, the electron configuration of lithium (2 Li) is: 1s?2s'.
This indicates that there are 2 electrons in the first s-sublevel and 1 electron in the 2TM4
s-sublevel.
The configuration for sodium (7 Na) atom is: 1s*2s*2p°3s'. This indicate that there
are 2 electrons in the first s-sublevel, 2 electrons in the second s-sublevel, 6 electrons

Rules Governing Electron Configuration
Most ofthe electronic configuration of an atom can be explained in terms ofthe building-up
principle, or also known as the Aufbau principle. According to the Aufbau principle, an
electron occupies the lowest energy orbital available before entering a higher energy orbital.
The atomic orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy. The orbital with the lowest energy
is the 1s orbital. The 2s orbital is the next higher in energy, then the 27 orbitals, and so on.
Beginning with the third main energy level, n=3, the energies ofthe sublevels in the different
main energy levels begin to overlap.
In Figure 1.12, for example, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel.
Therefore, the 4s orbital is filled before any electrons enter the 3d orbitals. Less energy is
required for two electrons to pair up in the 4s orbital than for asingle electron to occupy a3d
orbital. Which sublevel will be occupied after the 3d sublevel is fully occupied?
The electrons are arranged in sublevels according to Aufbau principle which is also known as
the diagonal rule. The diagonal rule is a guide to the order of filling energy sublevels. It is
particularly helpful for atoms with atomicnumbers higher than 18. This is because for atoms
with higher atomic numbers their sublevels are not regularly filled.
YS
Figure 1.12 Diagonal rule for writing electron configuration.
If you list the orbitals following the direction of arrows, you can obtain the electron
configuration of most atoms. Therefore, the order of filling the sublevels is given as:
1s? 2s* 2p° 3s? 3p° 4s? 3d!° 4p° 5s? 4d!9 Sp® 6s? 4f14 5d) 6p%...
The outermost occupied energy level of an atom is called the valence shell and the
electrons that enter into these energy levels are referred to as valence electrons.
Example 1
What is the electron configuration of magnesium, * Mg?
Solution:
5 Mg = Is? 2572p° 357 = in sublevel

From this, we can write the configuration of elements by using a noble gas as
a core and the electrons outside the core. Note that noble gases have complete
outer electron shells, with 2 or 8 electrons. Therefore, the above electron
configuration can be written as follows:

The Greek philosopher Democritus proposed what we consider as the first atomic
theory. He believed that all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles. He
named the particles atoms (meaning uncuttable or indivisible).
John Dalton’s work in atomic theory marked the start of modern chemistry. His
concept of an atom was far more detailed and specific than Democritus’.
Dalton did not try to describe the structure or composition of atoms — he did not
know what an atom really looked like. But he did realize that the different properties
shown by elements such as hydrogen and oxygen can be explained by assuming that
hydrogen atoms are not the same as oxygen atoms.
In our current view of atomic theory, atoms consist of smaller particles — electrons,
protons, and neutrons. The structure of an atom is basically a cloud of electrons
@& cHemistaveraDES
surrounding a small, dense region, called the nucleus. An electron is a negatively
charged particle with negligible mass.
The nucleus was discovered by Ernest Rutherford. Rutherford suggested that the
charge and mass of an atom are concentrated in its nucleus, and that the nucleus has
positive charge.
In current views, the nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons. Protons have
positive charge, and neutrons have no charge. Each element has a unique number of
protons in its atoms. This number is the atomic number of the element, and is
designated by Z. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom
is the mass number of the element. Mass number is designated by 4. Atomic number
and mass number for an atom of an element, X, is designated by:
AZé
For a neutral atom,
¢ the number of protons = the number of electrons = atomic number.
¢ the number of protons + the number of neutrons = mass number.
Over centuries, scientists have developed these main atomic models:
¢ Dalton’s Model: an atom is a solid, indestructible sphere.
¢ Thomson’s Model: an atom is a sphere with a uniform positive charge. Negatively
charged electrons are embedded in the positive charge.
¢ Rutherford’s Model: Rutherford discovered that atoms are mostly empty space
with a dense, positive nucleus.
¢ Bohr’s Model: in an atom, electrons follow circular orbits around the nucleus.
The Bohr Model was the first quantum mechanical model of the atom.
¢ The Quantum Mechanical Model: in an atom, the orbits of electrons around
the nucleus are elliptical. This theory is a modification of the Bohr model.
The quantum mechanical description of an atom is the electron configuration of the
atom — the arrangement of electrons in the atom. The maximum number of electrons in
a main energy level is 2n*, where n is the principal quantum number.
The quantum mechanical model is governed by this principle:
The Aufbau principle is a guide to the order of filling energy levels and sublevels.
According to this principle lower energy sub levels are completely filled before
electrons enter higher energy sublevels.

the class.
What was the basis for the early attempts in classifying the elements? Outline the
contributions of some scientists you have read about in classfying the elements.
Before the beginning of the 18" century, it was easy to study and remember the
properties of the elements because very few were known. However, in the middle of
the 19" century, many more elements were discovered. Scientists then began to
investigate possibilities for classifying the known elements in a simple and useful
manner. After numerous attempts, the scientists were ultimately successful. They
grouped elements with similar properties together. This arrangement is known as the
classification of elements.
Early Attempts in classifying the elements
What is meant by the term periodicity? Can you give some periodic events in
nature?
Early attempts to classify elements were based merely on atomic mass. Then scientists
began to seek relationships between atomic mass and other properties of the
elements.
i) Dobereiner's Triads: One of the first attempts to group similar elements was
made in 1817 by the German chemist J. Dobereiner. He put together similar
elements in group of three or triads. According to Dobereiner, when elements in
a triad are arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses, the middle element
had the average atomic mass of the other two elements. For example, because
the atomic mass of bromine is nearly equal to the average atomic mass of
chlorine and iodine, he considered these three elements to constitute a triad when
arranged in this order: chlorine, bromine, iodine see Table 2.2.

Do you think that this classification works for all elements?
@ cHemistaveraDes
ii) Newlands's Law of Octaves: In 1864, John Newlands, an English chemist,
reported the law of octave, which is also known as the law of eight. He stated
that when elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic masses,
every eighth element had similar properties to the first element.
Newlands first two octaves of eight elements are shown below:
Li Be B C N O F
Na Mg Al Si P S Cl
K Ca
However, the law of octaves could not be applied beyond calcium.

While attempting to group the elements according to their
chemical properties and atomic weights, Dimitri Mendeleev
developed the periodic table and formulated the periodic law.
Because his classification revealed recurring patterns (periods) in
the elements, Mendeleev was able to leave spaces in his table for
elements that he correctly predicted would be discovered.
Dimitri Mendeleev
@ cHemistayeraDes
(2.2.1 The Periodic Law
A. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law
In 1869, the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev and the German scientist Luthar
Meyer independently published periodic arrangements of the elements based on
increasing atomic mass.
Mendeleev observed that, when elements are arranged according to increasing atomic
mass, the chemical and physical properties of the elements recur at regular intervals.
This periodic variation and the recurrence of the properties of the elements led to the
formulation of the Periodic Law.
Mendeleev's periodic law states that the properties of the elements are periodic
functions of their atomic masses. Only 63 elements were known when Mendeleev
constructed his table in 1871. Mendeleev organized his table in columns, with each
column containing elements that have similar chemical properties. Accordingly,
elements in the same column gave family or groups of elements.
How did Mendeleev know where to leave gaps for undiscovered elements in his
periodic table?
Mendeleev left blank spaces for the undiscovered elements and also predicted masses
and other properties of these unknown elements almost correctly. For example,
neither gallium nor germanium were discovered when Mendeleev constructed his
periodic table. But he predicted the existence and properties of these unknown
elements.
Mendeleev left two blank spaces for these two elements in the table, just under
aluminium and silicon. He called these unknown elements 'eka-aluminium' and 'eka-
silicon." (‘eka' means 'first'). What he meant by 'eka-aluminium' is "a currently known
element (galium) following aluminium".
Later on, in 1874, the element Gallium (eka-aluminium in Mendeleev's system) was
discovered. In 1886, the element Germanium (eka-silicon) was discovered. The
observed properties of these elements were remarkably very close to those in
Mendeleev’s predictions. Table 2.3 shows the properties of eka-silicon predicted by
Mendeleev and compares them to the observed properties of Germanium.

Defects in Mendeleev's periodic table
1. Position of isotopes: The isotopes were not given separate places in Mendeleev's
periodic table. Since elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses,
the isotopes belong to different groups (because isotopes have different masses).
2. Wrong order of atomic masses of some elements: When certain elements are
grouped on the basis of their chemical properties, some elements with higher
atomic masses precede those with lower atomic masses. For example, argon,
with atomic mass of 39.95, precedes potassium with atomic mass of 39.1.
B The Modern Periodic Law
What was Mosley's contribution to the modern form of the Periodic Table?
In 1913, the English physicist Henry Mosley determined the atomic number of each of
the elements by analyzing their X-ray spectra. He observed that when each element
was used as a target in an X-ray tube, it gave out X-rays with a characteristic
wavelength. The wavelength depends on the number of protons in the nucleus of the
atom and was constant for a given element. By arranging the elements in order of
decreasing wavelength, Mosley was able to assign atomic number to each element.
The atomic number of every element is fixed, and it clearly distinguishes one element
from another. 'No two elements can have the same atomic number.' For example,
atomic number 8 identifies the element oxygen. No other element can have atomic
number 8.
@ cHemistaveraDES
Therefore, the atomic number of an element is the fundamental property that
determines the chemical behavior of the element. The discovery of atomic number led
to the development of the modern periodic law. The modern periodic law states that:
“the properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers.” This
means that when elements are arranged according to increasing atomic number,
elements with similar physical and chemical properties fall in the same group.
Many different forms of the periodic table have been published since Mendeleev's
time. Today, the long form of the periodic table, which is called the modern periodic
table, is commonly in use. It is based on the modern periodic law. In the modern
periodic table, elements are arranged in periods and groups.
What are the basis for classifying the elements into groups and periods?
What are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of S
and Cl?
Periods: The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods or
series.
Elements in a period are arranged in increasing order of their atomic numbers from left
to right.
There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table, and each period is represented by
an Arabic numeral: 1, 2... and 7.
e Elements in the same period have the same number of shells.
¢ Periods 1, 2, and 3 are called short periods while periods 4, 5, and 6 are
known as long periods.
¢ Period | contains only 2 elements, hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and period 3
contain 8 elements each.
¢ Period 4 and period 5 contain 18 elements each. Period 6, the longest period,
has 32 elements. Period 7, which is an incomplete period, contains more than
24 elements.Period 7 element is radioactive and/or an artificial element.
¢ Except for the first period, all periods start with an alkali metal and ends with a
noble gas.
ERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THEELEMENTS

1 1s 2
2 2s, 2p 8
3 3s, 3p 8
4 4s, 3d, 4p 18
and so on
The position of an element in a given period can be determined by the number of
shells occupied with its electrons. Accordingly, the number of shell is equal to the
number of period to which the element belongs.
Example
Electronic configuration of 73Na = 1s°2s’2p%3s! (2, 8, 1). Sodium has 3 main
shells. Hence, sodium is found in period 3.
What are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of F
and Cl?
Groups or families: are the vertical columns of elements in the periodic table. There
are 18 columns or groups in the modern periodic table.
¢ Group numbers are usually designated with the Roman numerals I to VIII each
followed by the letter A or B.
These are: IA.2.. e.e. VIII A Main groups (A groups)
IB... 2... VIIIB Sub groups (B groups)
¢ Elements in a given group have the same number of outermost shell electrons.
¢ Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties.
¢ For the main group elements the group number equals the number of valence
electrons.
Example
Electronic configuration of 7?Cl = 1s?2s?2p°3s?3p° (2, 8, 7). The number of
valence electrons of chlorine is 7. Hence chlorine is found in Group VIIA.

Elements in a periodic table can be classified into three distinct categories based on
their electron configuration and the type of sub-level being filled. These are the
representative elements, the transition elements, and the rare-earth elements.
1. Representative Elements: s-and p-block elements
These are elements in which valence electrons are filling the s- or p-orbitals.
Representative elements are also known as Main Group Elements. They include
elements in groups IA through VIIA.
s-block elements are elements in which the last electron enters the s-orbital of the
outermost shell. Their general valence shell configuration is ms' and ns’, where n
represents the outermost shell. They are found on the left side of the periodic table
@ cremistevcraves
and contain the first two groups: Group IA and Group IIA. These two groups
contain very reactive metals.
p-block Elements are elements in which the last electron enters the p-orbital of the
outermost shell. They have the general valence shell electron configuration of ns*np'—
ns-np®. p-block elements are located at the right hand side of the periodic table and
they include six groups-Group IIIA to VIIIA. Most of these elements are non-metals.

Why is helium classified as a noble gas?
2. Transition Elements: d-block elements
These elements are found in the periodic table between the s-block and p-block
elements. In these elements, the valence electrons are being added to the d-orbital of
the outermost shell. They are also known as d-block elements. They are designated
as 'B' group, and they consist of groups IB — VIIIB. The transition elements are found
in periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. They include common elements such as iron, gold, and
copper. d-block elements are also called transition metals.
3. Rare-Earth Elements: f-block elements
These elements are also known as inner-transition elements. They are elements in
which the last electrons are being added to the forbital of the outermost shell. The
inner transition elements are in periods 6 and 7. The period 6 inner transition series
fills the 4forbitals. It is known as the Lanthanide series because it occurs after the
element lanthanum and its elements are similar to it. The period 7 inner transition
series fills the 5/orbitals and appears after the element actinium. Its elements are
similar to actinium, thus it is known as the Actinide series.
Figure 2.1 presents a scheme to show the basic structure of the periodic table. On the
basis of the electron configuration of the elements the table is divided into s, p, d and
f-blocks.

Activity 2.4
Refer any chemistry book and look up values for atomic size, ionization energy,
electronegativity and other properties of elements. Enter the values in the periodic table,
and see if there any obvious trends in the properties as you go across a period or down a
column of the table. Report your findings to the class.
In the periodic table the properties of the elements such as atomic size, ionization
energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity show a regular variation with in a group
or across a period.
Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and also
exhibit similar chemical properties. For example, group IA elements have 1 valence
electron; those in Group IIA have 2 valence electrons, and so on. Generally, it is
possible to conclude that the number of valence electrons determines the group
number of an element.

Cs 2, 8, 18, 18, 8, 1 1
The periodic properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of nuclear
charge and effective nuclear charge.
Nuclear charge (Z): is the total positive charge in the nucleus of an atom.
Effective Nuclear charge (Z,,): In an atom, the outermost shell electrons (or
valence electrons) are attracted to the nucleus and simultaneously repelled by the inner
shell electrons. The attraction of the nucleus for the valence electrons is also reduced
because inner electrons shield (or screen) the valence electrons. As a result, these
PERICLASOSIFICATIOND OF THEELEIMENTS —C
inner electrons reduce the attraction of the nuclear charge. The resulting net-positive
nuclear charge attracting the valence electrons is called effective nuclear charge, Z.,..
Effective nuclear charge relates the nuclear charge to the number of shells (size) of the
atom.
The effective nuclear charge is the difference between the nuclear charge (Z) and the
inner electrons (S) that shield the valence electrons. The effective nuclear charge is
always less than the actual nuclear charge.
Zo = ZS
Let us consider the sodium atom with its 11 electrons: 1s72s’2p°3s' (2, 8, 1). The 10
inner electrons of sodium completely cancel the 10 units of nuclear charge on the
nucleus. In this way, the inner electrons shield the valence electrons from the full
attractive force of the nucleus and leave an effective nuclear charge of + 1 (Z,,.=+ 1).
The fact that the inner electrons shield or screen the outer electrons from the full
charge of the nucleus is known as shielding or screening effect.
Activity 2.5
Form a group and perform the following task:
Draw Bohr's model for the following elements and indicate the shielding shells, shielding
electrons and effective nuclear charge:
a beryllium, magnesium and calcium;
b lithium, carbon and fluorine.
Present your findings to the class.
The following properties of elements vary in a regular periodic manner.
1. Nuclear Charge
On moving down a given group of the periodic table, nuclear charge progressively
increases, but effective nuclear charge remains nearly constant.
2. Atomic Size/Atomic Radius
Where in a group do you find atoms with the largest atomic radius? Why?
It is difficult to measure the size of an atom directly. The electron cloud enveloping the
nucleus does not have a clear boundary because its electrons do not have fixed
distances from the nucleus. Therefore, atoms do not have definite outer boundaries.
The size of an atom is defined in terms of its atomic radius. For metals, atomic radius
is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of the two adjacent atoms. For
@ cHemistaveraDES
elements that exist as diatomic molecules (such as chlorine), atomic radius is equal to
one-half of the distance between the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule. Figure 2.2
illustrates the atomic radius of chlorine in a chlorine molecule.

In moving down a group, atomic radius of the elements mainly depends on the
number of shells.
Activity 2.6
Form a group and perform the following task; present your findings to the class.
The following values are given for atomic radii (in A) of group IA elements:
1.54, 1.34, 2.35, 2.16 and 1.96
Based on the given information;
1. fill the following table with the number of shells and the appropriate values for atomic
radii corresponding to the symbols of the elements.

3. Ionization Energy
In which region of the periodic table do you find elements with the:
a lowest tendency to lose electrons, and
b highest tendency to lose electrons?
Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove the outermost shell
electron from an isolated gaseous atom or ion.
ERIOCLADSSIFICATIOIN OFTHEELCEMENTS —
Ionization energy is represented by the following equation (where M denotes any
metal).
M (g) + energy ——> M* (g) +&
The electrons in an atom can be successively removed, one after another. Thus, the
first ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the first valence electron, the
second ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the second valence electron,
and so on.
M (g) + energy ——> M?* (g) + & => First ionization energy
M* (g) + energy ——> M** (g) +e == Second ionization energy
For a given element, the second ionization energy is higher than the first one.
Ionization energy is always a positive value (and therefore is an endothermic process)
because energy is required to remove an electron from an atom. Ionization energy is
measured in electron volts (eV) or kiloJoules per mole (kJ/mol).
Ionization energy is a measure of the tendency of an atom to lose an electron. Metals
easily lose electrons and thus have low ionization energy. Non-metals have high
ionization energy because they do not easily lose electrons.
Activity 2.7
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Rank each set of the following elements in order of decreasing ionization energy and
explain the trend in ionization energy of the elements down a group.
i) Ca, Sr, Mg, Be
ii) K, Li, Rb, Na
iii) Cl, F, |, Br
Generally, ionization energy is affected by the following factors:
i) Atomic size: As atomic size increases, the valence electrons are less tightly
held by the nucleus. Thus, less energy is required to remove these electrons.
For example, the energy needed to remove an electron from a cesium atom is
lower than from a lithium atom.
ii) Effective nuclear charge: The smaller the effective nuclear charge of an atom,
the lower is the energy needed to remove an electron from the atom.
iii) Types of electrons: The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the more difficult
it is to remove the electron. In a given energy level, s-electrons are closer to
@ cHemistaveraDES
the nucleus than p-electrons. Similarly, p-electrons are closer than d-electrons,
and d-electrons are closer than /electrons. Hence, ionization energy
decreases in the order of: s>p>d>f
Screening effect by the inner electrons: As described earlier, inner shell
electrons shield the valence electrons from the nuclear charge. The more inner
electrons there are, the higher the screening effect, and therefore the easier it
is to remove the valence electrons. Screening decreases ionization energy.
Electron configuration (stability): It is easier to remove electrons from unstable
sublevels than from stable ones. Half-filled (p°*, @, £7) and completely-filled
(d'°, p°®, f') sublevels are more stable. For example, more energy is
required to remove ap’ electron than a p’ electron. As a result of it, the first
ionization energy of nitrogen is higher than that of oxygen.
Generally, with the increasing atomic number, the first ionization energy decreases
down the same group.
Activity 2.8
After studying the given information, identify the elements represented by X, M, and Y;
discuss the findings in your group, and then share your conclusion with the other groups.
Element X
* has a relatively high ionization energy.
* generally forms an ion with a — 2 charge.
* has an outermost electron configuration of 3573p*.
Element M
* reacts with oxygen to form M,O.
¢ has a very low ionization energy.
¢ is in the fourth period of the periodic table.
Element Y
* is a transition element.
* is used in Ethiopian coinage.
¢ has 10 electrons in the 3d orbital
4, Electron Affinity (E,)
To which group it is easier to add electrons; alkali metals or halogens?
Non-metals gain electrons and therefore form negative ions. The tendency of an atom
to form a negative ion is expressed in terms of electron affinity (£,).
PERICLASOSIFICATIOND OF THEELEIMENTS —C
Electron affinity is defined as the energy released in kilojoules/mole, when an electron
is added to an isolated gaseous atom to form a gaseous ion. It is a measure of the
attraction or ‘affinity’ of the atom for the extra added electron.
X(g) + e —— X (g) + energy
Since energy is liberated during the process, electron affinity is expressed as a
negative value. For example, when an electron is added to a fluorine (F) atom, 328
kJ/mol of energy is released to produce a fluoride ion (F°), and E, is — 328 kJ/mol.
F(g) + © ——> F (g) + E, =— 328 kJ/mol
Electron affinity is a measure of the strength of an atom to attract an additional
electron. The smaller is the atomic size of an element, the stronger is the tendency to
form negative ions, and consequently the higher the electron affinity. Generally,
electron affinity depends on atomic size and effective nuclear charge of the elements.
Activity 2.9
Form a group and discuss the following concepts.
1. Why does the electron affinity of Cl is higher than that of F?
2. Explain why noble gases have extremely low (almost zero) electron affinities?
3. Explain why halogens have the highest electron affinities?
Present your findings to the class.
5. Electronegativity
Where do you find the most electronegative element in the periodic table?
Electronegativity is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract the shared electrons
in the chemical bond. The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901-1994) developed
the most widely used scale of electronegativity values based on bond strength. The
Pauling scale ranges from 0.7 to 4.0. Fluorine, the most electronegative element, is
assigned a value of 4.0, and the least electronegative element, cesium, has an
electronegativity value of 0.7. The electronegativity values for all the rest elements lie
between these extremes.
The electronegativity of an atom is related to its ionization energy and electron affinity.
@ cHemistaveraDES
An atom with high ionization energy and high electron affinity also tends to have a high
electronegativity value because of its strong attraction for electrons in a chemical
bond.
Activity 2.10
Form a group and perform the following task:
Arrange each set of the given elements in order of decreasing electronegativity and
explain the observed trend.
a Ba, Mg, Be, Ca
b C, Pb, Ge, Si
Cc Cl, F, |, Br
Present your findings to the class.
6. Metallic Character
In which region of the periodic table do you find metals and non-metals?
Metals have the tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions. As a result, metals
are called electropositive elements.
In moving down a group, atomic size increases progressively, and it becomes easier
for elements to lose their valence electrons and form positive ions. Therefore, metallic
character increases down a group.
In the periodic table, metals and non-metals are separated by a stair step diagonal
line, and elements near this border line are called metalloids. Metals are found on the
left side of the line and nonmetals on its right side.
Activity 2.11
Form a group, perform the following task and present your findings to the class:
1. The members of group IVA of the periodic table are: Ge, Sn, C, Pb and Si.

Part IT: Give short answers for the following
4. What is screening effect? How does it relate to effective nuclear charge?

Activity 2.12
Form a group and draw a rough sketch of the periodic table (no details are required). Based
on this, perform the following activities and present your findings to the class.
1. Indicate the regions where metals, non-metals, and metalloids are located in the
periodic table. (Use different colours).
2. Where do you find the most active metal and the most active non-metal? .
As we move from left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons of the
elements increases. But the number of energy levels or main shells remains the same
in a given period and electrons are filling the same energy level until stable noble gas
configuration is achieved. The additional electrons from Li (2, 1) to Ne (2, 8) are
added to the second shell. In fact, the period number equals the number of energy
level being filled.

Let us now consider periodic properties of elements across a period.
1. Atomic Size: From left to right in a given period, nuclear charge or atomic
number progressively increases by one for every succeeding element. However,
increasing number of valence electrons is being added to the same shell. This
results in an increase in effective nuclear charge.
Activity 2.13
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
The following values are given for atomic radii (in A) of period 2 elements:
0.77, 1.34, 0.69, 0.75, 0.73, 0.82, 0.90, and 0.71.

1. fill the table given below with the appropriate values for atomic radii of the
elements.
2. explain the reason for the observed trend.

2. Ionization Energy: Two factors account for the general trend in ionization
energy across a given period. These are nuclear charge and atomic size.

The following table lists ionization energy values of period 3 elements

1. Explain why there is a general increase in the first ionization energy across
the period from Na to Ar.
2. Explain why the first ionization energy of:
i) aluminium is lower than that of magnesium.
ii) sulphur is lower than that of phosphorus.
(Hint: Use sublevel configurations for the elements).
Electron Affinity: The variation in electron affinity of elements in the same
period is due to changes in nuclear charge and atomic size of the elements.
A cross a period from left to right, electron affinity increases due to an increase
in effective nuclear charge. The elements show a greater attraction for an extra
added electron.
Electronegativity: Across a period, a gradual change in nuclear charge and
atomic size determine the trends in the electronegativity of the elements.
Activity 2.15
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
The following values are given for electronegativity of period 3 elements:
2.1, 0.9, 1.5, 3.0, 1.8, 2.5 and 1.2
Based on the information given;
1. Draw a table of period 3 elements and fill with the appropriate electronegativity
values corresponding to the symbols of the elements.
2. Explain the reason for the observed trend.
5. Metallic character: From left to right in a period, metallic character of the
elements decreases. Elements on the left end of a period have a higher tendency
to form positive ions. Those at the right end have a greater tendency to form
negative ions. In any period, elements on the left side are metals and those on
the right side are nonmetals.
Consider the following period-3 elements and observe how the elements become
more non-metallic on moving from left to right in the periodic table:

¢ describe the advantages of periodic classification in studying chemistry.
Activity 2.16
Form a group and discuss the importance of the periodic table for predicting the atomic
size and ionization energy of the elements. Share your idea with the class.
Why do we need the classification of elements?
The main advantages of using the periodic table are:
1. The periodic table is useful for predicting the formulas of compounds. The
elements in a given group form compounds with the same atomic ratio
@ cHemistayeraDes
because of their similar electron configuration. For example, if the chemical
formula of sodium oxide is Na,O, then we can predict the formulas of the
other oxides of alkali metals. These are Li,O, K,O, Rb,O, and Cs,O.
2. The periodic table is useful for predicting the physical and chemical properties
of elements. For example, radium is a rare and radioactive element and
therefore difficult to handle in many experiments. Since its properties can be
predicted from the general trends of group IIA elements, sometimes we do
not need to analyze it directly.
3. The periodic table is also useful for predicting the behaviour of many
compounds. For example, oxides of the elements become more acidic across
a period and more basic in character down a group. The trends in the oxides
of period-3 elements vary from strongly basic oxides to amphoteric and then
acidic oxides as we move across a period.

How do you account for the unexpected resemblance of the properties of
the following sets of elements: Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si?
In addition to the group and period relationships, the elements of s and p block
also exhibit diagonal relationship. On moving diagonally across the periodic table, the
elements show certain similarities. Though clear upon examination, these diagonal
relationships are far less pronounced than the similarities within a group.
Diagonal relationship is particularly noticeable in the elements of second and third
periods of the periodic table. The following illustrations show the diagonal relationship
between Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si.

Early attempts of classification of the elements were made by Dobereiner and
Newlands.
Mendeleev’s law states that properties of the elements are periodic functions of
their atomic masses.
Mendeleev arranged the elements based on increasing atomic mass.
Modern periodic law states that the properties of the elements are periodic
function of their atomic numbers.
Periods are horizontal rows, and groups are vertical columns of the elements in
the periodic table.
Elements in the same group show similar chemical properties.
Elements are classified as representative, transition, and rare-earth elements.
This classification is based on the type of sub-level (s, p, d, or /) being filled.
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost shell electron
from an isolated gaseous atom.
Electron affinity of an element is the energy released when an electron is added
to an isolated gaseous atom to form a gaseous ion.
Metallic character is the tendency to lose electrons and form positively charged
ions.
Electronegativity of an element 1s its ability to attract electrons.
Trends in atomic size determine the trends in ionization energy, electron affinity,
electronegativity, and metallic character of the elements in the periodic table.
Atomic size itself is determined by the number of energy levels, nuclear charge,
and effective nuclear charge.
Periodic properties of elements, such as ionization energy, electron affinity,
electronegativity, etc. show regular variation within a group or period.
Part I: Identify whether each of the following statements
is true or false. Give your reasons when you
consider a statement to be false.
I. Metallic properties of the elements increase from left to right within a period.

Objective of the Activity
Scientists have identified different types of attractive forces between atoms in forming
bonds. The strength of the forces relies on the types of bonds. For instance, in
covalent bonds, the strength of the bonds depends on whether the bonds are
single, double or triple bonds.

of bonds.

Activity 3.1
Most of the elements are not found free in nature. Why do the elements exists in
combined form ? Discuss in group and present your findings to the class.
A chemical bond is the attractive force that binds atoms together in a molecule, or a
crystal lattice.
After the periodic table and the concept of electron configuration were developed,
scientists began to develop ideas about molecules and compounds. In 1916,
GN Lewis concluded that atoms combine in order to achieve a more stable electron
configuration resulting in molecules or compounds.
Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875 - 1946), introduced the theory of the
shared-electron-pair chemical-bond formation in a paper
published in the journal of the American chemical society. In
honor of this contribution, we sometimes refer to “electron-dot”
structures as “Lewis structures”
G.N. Lewis

As independent particles, atoms are at relatively high potential energy. Nature, favors
arrangements in which potential energy is minimized. Most individual atoms exist in a
less stable state than in their combined form.
When atoms form bonds with each other, they attain lower potential energy states.
This decrease in atomic energy generally results in a more stable arrangement of matter.
When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, only their outer regions are in contact.
In the process of the interaction, atoms achieve stable outermost shell configuration.
For this reason, when we study chemical bonding, we are concerned primarily with
the valence electrons. As described in Unit 2, valence electrons are electrons that exist
in the outermost shell of an atom.
Activity 3.2
Form a group and discuss the following:
The following table shows elements of group VIIIA and their atomic numbers. In the space
provided fill the valence shell electron configuration and number of valence electrons for

it has only 2 valence electrons.

Share your discussion with the rest of the class.
Noble gas atoms with eight electrons (except for, He) in the outermost shell are stable.
Thus, the ns*np° electronic valence structure has maximum stability. Atoms containing
less than eight electrons in their outermost shell are unstable. To attain stability, these
atoms tend to have eight electrons in their valence shells. This leads to the explanation
of the octet rule. The rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose or share electrons until
there are eight electrons in their valence shell.
The type or characteristic of the resulting arrangement depends largely on the type of
chemical bonding that exists between the atoms. These are ionic, covalent, and metallic
bonds.

Activity 3.3
Form a group and discuss each of the following concepts. Share your ideas with the class.
1. Why do some atoms easily lose electrons and others do not?
2. Sodium chloride, NaCl is a good conductor in the form of liquid state, but a non
conductor in the form of solid state.
When an atom either loses or gains electrons, it becomes an ion. An ion is an electrically
charged particles. Two different types of ions exist. These are the positive ions called
cations and the negative ions called anions.
The chemical properties of metals differ from those of non-metals. A metal has 1, 2,
or 3 electrons in its outermost shell. Metals tend to lose these electrons and become
positively charged ions. For example, if a metal (M) loses one electron, it becomes an
ion with a charge of +1.
mx€
However, if it loses two electrons it becomes an ion with a charge of +2:
A non-metal may have 4, 5, 6, or 7 electrons in its outermost shell. Non-metals tend
to gain electrons to form negatively charged ions. For example, if a non-metal (X)
gains one electron, it becomes an ion with a charge of —1.
Note that hydrogen can form both a cation, H* (Aydrogen ion) as in HCl, or an anion
H” (hydride ion) as in NaH.
Metals in Group IA, the alkali metals, tend to lose one electron when they combine
with other elements, producing cations of +1 charge. For example, Na and K each
lose one electron to form ions of +1 charge.
Na > Na* + e
sodium atom sodium ion
K > Kt + e
potassium atom potassium ion
On the other hand, Group VIIA elements, the halogens, usually gain one electron and
produce an ion with —1 charge. For example, each Cl and Br atom accepts one
electron to produce an ion with —1 charge.
Cl + @& — Cl-
chlorine atom chloride ion
Br + @& > Br
bromine atom bromide ion

Tonic Bond formation
When two atoms combine, one of the atoms gains electrons and becomes an anion
and the other loses electrons to form a cation. When a cation and an anion are brought
close to one another, an electrostatic force of attraction is set up between them. This
force of attraction between oppositely charged ions is called an ionic bond. It is also
called an electrovalent bond. The bond is produced when electrons are transferred
from the outermost shell of a metal atom to the outermost shell of a nonmetal atom.
To illustrate ionic bonding, let us consider the formation of the bond between sodium
and chlorine. A sodium atom has | valence electron. In order to attain the electron
configuration of the nearest noble gas (Ne), it has to lose its valence electron and
form a sodium ion (Na‘). Chlorine has 7 valence electrons. By gaining | electron,
chlorine attains the electron configuration of argon (Ar) and form a chloride ion (CI).
mx
In general, an ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electron from a metal to a
nonmetal- for example, sodium and chlorine. Atoms that are bound together by an
ionic bond form ionic compounds. For example, Na’ and Cl ions form sodium
chloride, NaCl. The transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine and the formation
of the ionic bond in sodium chloride is shown with the following shell diagrams.

Electron-dot notation is often used to represent the outermost shell electron
configurations of the elements. These formulas, also called Lewis formulas, consist of
the symbol of the element plus dots equal to the number of valence electrons in the
atom or ion. Since valence shells contain a maximum of eight electrons, electron-dot
symbols contain a maximum of eight dots. Electron-dot formulas of sodium and chlorine

Many molecules are formed when outermost shell or valence electrons are shared
between two atoms. This sharing of electrons creates a covalent bond.
Covalent bond formation can be illustrated by the sharing of electrons between two
hydrogen atoms to form a molecule of hydrogen.

Figure 3.6 Sharing of electrons between hydrogen atoms in H, molecule.
In the hydrogen molecule, each hydrogen atom attains the stable electron configuration
of helium.
In a covalent bond, each electron in a shared pair is attracted to the nuclei of both
atoms as shown in Figure 3.6. The shared electrons spend most of their time between
the two nuclei. The electrostatic attraction between the two positively charged nuclei
and the two negatively charged electrons hold the atoms in the molecule together. This
mm
attractive force between positively charged nuclei of atoms and the shared electrons in
a molecule is known as covalent bond.

the two atoms. Each atom in the molecule attains a stable electron configuration.

Figure 3.7 Hydrogen and chlorine share a pair of electrons in HCI.
The concept of Lewis formula representation can also be extended to covalent bonds.
The Lewis structure for a covalent compound shows the arrangement of atoms in a
molecule and all the valence electrons for the atoms involved in the compound. It is
conventional to represent the non-bonding (lone pair) electrons by dots and the pair
of electrons that are shared between atoms by a dash. For example, consider the
hydrogen molecule:
The electron-dot formula of the hydrogen molecule is:
He + eH + H8H
The covalent bond in hydrogen molecule is also written as H — H.
The formation of the covalent bond in hydrogen chloride is shown by the following
electron-dot formula. This formula must satisfy the octet rule (for chlorine) and the
doublet rule (for hydrogen). As shown in the illustration, these requirements are satisfied.
The shared pair belongs to both of the atoms (hydrogen and chlorine) in the hydrogen
chloride molecule. The resulting valence electron configuration provides two valence
electrons to hydrogen and eight to chlorine.
The chlorine atom in the molecule has three pairs of electrons, which are not used for
bonding. Pairs of electrons that is not used for bonding are called lone-pair electrons.
Pairs that are used for bonding are called bonding-pair electrons.

@ chewstryorave9
Consider the fluorine molecule, F,. The electron configuration of fluorine is 2, 7. Thus
each fluorine atom has seven valence electrons. Accordingly, there is only one unpaired
electron on fluorine. Therefore, the formation of the fluorine molecule is represented as
oe ee
Lone pairs sF 3 Fs Lone pairs
!
Bond pair
Note that only two valence electrons participate in the formation of fluorine molecule.
The others are non-bonding electron (lone pairs). Thus each fluorine atom in fluorine
molecule has three lone-pairs of electrons. The resulting molecule is a diatomic molecule.
A diatomic molecule consists of two atoms. All the other members of the halogen
family form diatomic molecules in the same way as fluorine does.
The maximum number of covalent bonds that an atom can form can be predicted
from the number of electrons needed to fill its valence shell. For example, each member
of Group IVA elements has four electrons in its valence shell, and it needs four more
electrons to achieve stable noble-gas electron configuration. Thus, it forms four covalent
bonds for carbon in methane, CH, as shown below:

Atoms can form different types of covalent bonds. These are single bonds, double
bonds and triple bonds.
In a single bond two atoms are held together by one electron pair.
um
How are the covalent bonds in H, Cl, and HCI formed?
Many covalent compounds are held together by multiple bonds. Multiple bonds are
formed when two or three electron pairs are shared by two atoms. If two atoms
share two pairs of electrons, the covalent bond is called a double bond. For example,
double bonds are found in molecules of carbon dioxide (CO,) and ethene (C,H,).

Activity 3.9
Form a group and discuss the following idea:
The covalent bonds are formed by sharing of electrons. Compare covalent bonds formed
between atoms of the same elements and those formed between atoms of different
elements. (Example: H, and HCl).
Present your conclusion to the class.
A covalent bond is formed when electron pairs are shared between two atoms. In
molecules like H,, in which the atoms are identical, the electrons are shared equally
between the atoms. A covalent bond in which the electrons are shared equally between
the two atoms is called a non-polar covalent bond.
H-H
In other words, a non-polar bond is a covalent bond in which bonding electrons are
shared equally between identical atoms, resulting in a balanced distribution of electrical
charge.
In contrast, in the covalently bonded HCI molecule, the H and Cl atoms are of different
elements; therefore, they do not share the bonding electrons equally.
© CHEMICAL BONDING ANDINTERMOLECULARFORCES
A chemical bond in which shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of one
atom than the other is called a polar covalent bond, or simply a polar bond.
Polarity of bonds is caused by differences in the electronegativity of the two atoms
forming the bonds. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract the shared
electrons in a chemical bond toward itself.
Elements with high electronegativity have a higher tendency to attract electrons than
elements with low electronegativity. For example, in the case of HCI, the electronegativity
of the chlorine atom is higher than that of the hydrogen atom. The shared pair of
electrons is more strongly attracted to the nucleus of the chlorine atom. As a result,
the chlorine atom acquires a partial negative charge (0-) whereas the hydrogen atom
acquires a partial positive charge (5°). The delta is read as "partial" or "slightly."
If a molecule has a positive end and a negative end, it is said to be polar and posses
a dipole. Dipole means 'two poles’.
Experimental evidence indicates that, in the HCI molecule, the electrons spend more
time near the chlorine atom. We can think of this unequal sharing of electrons as a
partial electron transfer or a shift in electron density as shown below:
This unequal sharing of the bonding electron pair results in a relatively higher electron
density near the chlorine atom and a correspondingly lower electron density near
hydrogen.

a single bond, b double bond, and c triple covalent bond?
2. Draw Lewis structures for:

3. Draw Lewis structures for each of the following molecules:

A covalent bond in which one atom donates both electrons of the bond is called a
coordinate covalent bond. It is also called a dative bond. Such a bond is hypothetically
represented as:
@ chemistrycrave9
oN
As+ B — ASB
Once formed, a coordinate covalent bond has the same properties as any other covalent
bond. The atom that contributes both electrons for the bond is the donor atom, and
the atom that shares the electron pair is the acceptor atom.
For an atom to act as a donor, it must contain lone pair of electrons in its valence
Shell and the acceptor atom must have at least one vacant orbital.
For example, the ammonium ion, NH;, is formed by a coordinate covalent bond in
which the two non-bonding electrons on NH, bond with a hydrogen ion, H", which
has no electrons to contribute.

2. As compared to ionic compounds, covalent compounds have relatively lower
melting points and boiling points.
3. They do not conduct electric current when molten or in aqueous solution, because
they consist of molecules rather than of ions.

a Metals are solids. They contain large number of atoms in their crystals. What kind of
force do you think holds these metal atoms together?
lf How do you account for the properties of metals, such as conductivity, malleability, and
ductility in terms of the bonds in metals?
The highest energy orbitals of most metals are occupied by very few electrons. In
s-block metals, for example, one or two valence electrons occupy s orbitals in the
outermost levels (for example Na and Mg). Furthermore, the p orbitals of the outer
most level are also occupied partially in p-block metals (example Tl, Pb and Bi).
The d-block metals contain partially filled (7—1)d levels in their atomic states or principal
oxidation states. The bonding in metals is different from that in other types of crystals.
The valence electrons of metals are not held by individual atoms. Rather, they are
delocalized and mobile (free to move throughout the structure).
The valence electrons form a sea of electrons around the metal ions and these metal
ions are organized as a crystal. Metallic bonding results from the attraction between
the metal ions and the surrounding sea of electrons.
For example, as illustrated in Figure 3.8, a sodium metal crystal is a lattice-like array
of Na* ions surrounded by a sea of mobile bonding valence electrons.

The bonding valence electrons move freely throughout the entire crystal. This freedom
of movement is responsible for the electrical conductivity of metals.
Properties of Metallic Bonding
Have you ever visited a goldsmith workshop? Why are metals easily shaped into
thin sheets and drawn into wires?
The freedom of movement of bonding valence electrons is responsible for the high
electrical and thermal conductivity that characterizes the metals. Other properties of
metallic bonding contribute to unique properties of metals. For example, most metals
are easy to shape due to their malleability and ductility.
Malleability allows a substance such as a metal to be reshaped. By hammering and
bending some metals, you can create thin sheets. Ductility allows a substance to be
drawn or pulled out into long thin pieces, such as wires.
Metals are malleable and ductile because metallic bonding is the same in all directions
throughout the solid.
When we apply a force to metal, its cations swim freely within the sea of electrons
without breaking the crystal structure. For example, when you hammer, bend, or pull
on a metal to reshape it, you shift its cations around. The force you apply moves the
atoms around, for example, around corners in the lattice. This is the basis for malleability
and ductility of metals, which allows you to change its shape.
Model of a Metallic Crystal
Put about one hundred balls (for example, marble balls or balls made from other locally
available materials) into a rectangular glass trough. Shake the trough. Allow the balls to

Activity 3.12
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon: Why do covalent compounds
usually exist as gases and liquids?
Share your views with the rest of the class.
Inter-molecular forces are relatively weak forces of attraction that occur between
molecules. Inter-molecular forces vary in strength but are generally weaker than the
bonds that join atoms in molecules, ions in ionic compounds, and metal atoms in solid
metals. Inter-molecular forces acting between molecules include: dipole-dipole forces,
London dispersion forces and hydrogen bonding. Dipole-dipole attractions and
London forces are collectively called Van der Waal's forces.
A Dipole-Dipole Forces
Dipole-dipole forces are strong inter-molecular forces between polar molecules. A dipole
is created by equal but opposite charges separated by a short distance. A polar molecule
acts as a tiny dipole because of its uneven charge distribution.
A dipole is represented by an arrow with a head pointing toward the negative pole
and crossed tail situated at the positive pole. The dipole created by a hydrogen chloride
molecule, which has its negative end at the more electronegative chlorine atom, is as
shown below:
Figure 3.9 Dipole-dipole interactions in HCI molecules.
@ GhemstrycravES
The negative end in one polar molecule attracts the positive end in an adjacent molecule
in a liquid or solid. Dipole-dipole forces occur in molecules such as ethyl alcohol and
water.
B London Dispersion Forces
All molecules, including those without dipole moments, exert forces on each other. We
know this because all substances, even the noble gases, change from liquid to solid
state under different conditions.
Induced dipole
Induced dipole-induced dipole forces
Figure 3.10 Induced dipole-induced dipole forces between non-polar molecules.
London dispersion forces act between all atoms and molecules. They are the only
forces that exist between noble gas atoms and non-polar molecules. This fact is reflected
in the low boiling points of noble gases and non-polar molecules. Because dispersion
forces result from temporary redistribution of the electrons causing induced dipole-
dipole interactions, their strength increases with the number of electrons in the interacting
atoms or molecules. Hence, dispersion forces increase with atomic number or molar
mass. This trend can be seen by comparing the boiling points of gases (helium, He,
and argon, Ar), (hydrogen, H,, and oxygen, O,), and (chlorine, Cl,, and bromine,
Br,).
As an illustration, the boiling points of the noble gases are presented in Table 3.4.
Table 3.3 Boiling points of noble gases.
As you look down the column of noble gases, you note that boiling point increases.
This is because the induced dipole-dipole interaction increases.
C Hydrogen Bonding
Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of intermolecular force arising when a hydrogen
atom is bonded to highly electronegative elements, fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen.
Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of dipole-dipole interactions between polar
compounds. In such compounds, large electronegativity differences between the hydrogen
and the fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atoms make the bonds connecting them highly
polar. This polarity gives the hydrogen atom a positive charge. Moreover, the small
size of the hydrogen atom allows the atom to come very close to an unshared pair of
electrons on an adjacent molecule. Hydrogen bonding is responsible for the unusual
high boiling points of some compounds such as hydrogen fluoride (HF), water (HO)
and ammonia (NH,).
Hydrogen bonds are usually represented by dotted lines connecting the hydrogen atom
to the unshared electron pair of the electronegative atom to which it is attracted. For
example, the hydrogen bond in hydrogen fluoride, HF, results when the highly
electronegative F atom attracts the H atoms of an adjacent molecule.

A chemical bond is the attractive force that binds atoms together to form a
molecule (or a crystal lattice), an ionic or metallic crystal lattice.
An ionic bond is the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions
(cations and anions).
A covalent bond is formed by a shared pair of electrons.
A covalent bond in which one pair of electrons is shared is known as a single
bond; for example, H, written as H — H.
Atoms can also share more than one pair of electrons to form a multiple bond.
The sharing of three pairs of electrons forms a triple bond - for example, N,,,
written as N=N.
A dative or coordinate covalent bond is a bond in which one of the atoms
supplies both of the shared electrons to the covalent bond.
A metallic bond is the electrostatic attraction between positive metal ions and
delocalized electrons.
CHEMBONDING AIND INTERMCOLECULARFAORCES L
Inter-molecular forces are forces of attraction between covalently bonded
molecules. These include: London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and hydrogen
bonding.
London forces are forces of attractions between nonpolar molecules.
Dipole-dipole forces are the attractions between dipoles of polar molecules.
Hydrogen bonding is the attraction of covalently bonded hydrogen to lone pairs
on N, O, or F atoms in other molecules or in the same molecule (if the molecule
is large enough).

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND SToIcHIOMETAY
Chemical reactions are the basis of chemistry. Chemical reactions occur around us all
the time. For example, the burning of fuel, the souring of milk, metabolic processes of
our body and the decay of plants are some familiar chemical reactions in daily life.
A chemical reaction is the process in which reacting substances, called reactants, are
converted to new substances, called products. The characteristics of the products are
completely different from those of the reactants. The conversion process is a chemical
change.
Reactants — Products
For example, if you burn magnesium with oxygen, the magnesium and oxygen are
completely converted to magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is a soft, white,
crumbling powder. These characteristics of magnesium oxide are completely different
from the characteristics of the original substances, magnesium and oxygen. Magnesium
and oxygen are no longer present in the elemental form.
In summary, a chemical reaction has occurred in which the reactants, magnesium and
oxygen, underwent a complete chemical change, giving the product magnesium oxide.
All chemical reactions include three types of changes in the original substances. These
are changes in composition, properties and energy.
Activity 4.2
Form a group and perform the following task.
List some chemical processes that occur in your daily life. Identify the reactants and
products in each of these chemical processes.
Present your findings to the class.
Note that, in daily life, we use different terms for the same process of chemical
change. For example “the souring of milk” occurs due to the process of fermentation.
In scientific discussion we generally have a single term for each process.
Competencies

¢ state the law of conservation of mass and illustrate the law, using examples;

¢ state the law of definite proportion and illustrate it, using examples;
¢ demonstrate the law of definite proportion, using a simple experiment; and
¢ State the law of multiple proportion and illustrate it, using examples.
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. When wood burns, the ash weighs
much less than the original wood. Where did the “lost mass” go? How can you estimate
the mass of the wood that is no longer present?
Present your conclusion to the class.
While investigating the quantitative relations between substances in chemical reactions,
scientists formulated the three basic laws of chemical combination. These are:
i) The law of conservation of mass
ii) The law of definite proportions
iii) The law of multiple proportions
i) The Law of Conservation of Mass
In 1774, the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier performed an experiment in which he
heated a sealed glass container that held a sample of tin in air. He measured the mass of
the substances before and after heating and found them to be the same. This and other
similar experimental observations became the basis of the law of conservation of mass.
French chemist Antoine Lavoisier is considered the founder of
modern chemistry. He found that the amount of matter before a
chemical reaction is equal to the amount of matter afterwards, even
« though the matter may change in its form. Lavoisier also
experimented with the role of oxygen in combustion and
_ respiration in both plants and animals.
Antoine Lavoisier
The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a
chemical reaction. In other words, the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the
mass of the products, within the limits of experimental error. This law is also known as
the law of indestructibility of matter.
Mass of reactants = Mass of products
There is no loss or gain of substances during a chemical reaction, and mass is
conserved.
For example, consider the decomposition of mercury (II) oxide. When 100 g of
mercury (II) oxide decomposes by heat, 92.6 g of mercury and 7.4 g of oxygen are
formed. Note that the total mass of mercury and oxygen after decomposition is 100 g:

ii) The Law of Definite Proportions
The law of definite proportions states that a compound always contains the same
elements in the same proportion by mass. This means that all pure samples of a
compound have the same composition regardless of the source of sample. This law is
also known as the law of constant composition. For example, sample of water could
be obtained from different sources, such as from a river, the ground, or the ocean.
But whatever the original source, all forms of pure water contains 11.2% hydrogen
and 88.8% oxygen by mass. These percentages represent a ratio of 1.0 to 8.0 (1:8),
by mass, of hydrogen to oxygen.
This ratio is constant (fixed) for water. In other words, a compound with a different
ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is not water.
Similarly, in forming the compound ZnO, 65.0 g of zinc combines with 16.0 g of
oxygen. This is 80.2% zinc and 19.8% oxygen, by mass. As is the case for water,
the composition of ZnO is constant. In forming ZnO, zinc combines with oxygen in a
definite proportion.

iii) The Law of Multiple Proportions
The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements combine to form more
than one compound, the masses of one element combined with a fixed mass of the
second element are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This law can be illustrated by
the two oxides of carbon. The two oxides of carbon are carbon monoxide (CO) and
carbon dioxide (CO,). In CO,, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 2.67 g of oxygen;
whereas in CO, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 1.33 g of oxygen. By comparing
2.67 g of oxygen with 1.33 g of oxygen, it is found that the masses of oxygen in the
two compounds that combine with the same mass of carbon are in the simple whole
number ratio, 2:1.

Activity 4.5
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1. What is the difference between a chemical equation and a chemical reaction?
2. Which law is satisfied when a chemical equation is balanced? Take a simple chemical
reaction to illustrate this law.
Present your conclusion to the class.
A chemical equation is a shorthand representation of a chemical reaction in terms of
chemical symbols and formulas. In a chemical equation the starting substances are
called reactants; and the new substances produced are known as products.
Reactants are written on the left side and products on the right side of the equation.
An arrow (—>) is placed between the two sides to indicate transformation of reactants
into products.
Reactants — products
In writing chemical equation, instead of using words, chemical symbols and formulas
are used to represent the reaction.
Steps to Write a Chemical Equation
1. Write a word equation: A word equation is stated in words. For example, the
word equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine to produce sodium
chloride is written as:
Sodium + Chlorine — Sodium chloride (word equation)
Note that we read the '+ ' sign as 'reacts with' and the arrow can be read as
'to produce’, 'to form’, 'to give' or 'to yield’.
2. Write the symbols and formulas for the reactants and products in the word
equation.
Na+ Cl, — NaCl (Chemical equation)
3. Balance the equation.
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
mxd¢ _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
Generally, any chemical equation must fulfil the following conditions:
i) The equation must represent a true and possible chemical reaction.
ii) The symbols and formulas must be written correctly. The elements— hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine exist as diatomic
molecules. These elements should be written as molecules in the equation.
iii) The equation must be balanced.
A chemical equation has both qualitative and quantitative meanings.
Qualitatively, a chemical equation indicates the types of the reactants and products
in the reaction.
Quantitatively, a chemical equation expresses the relative number (amount)
of moles, molecules or masses of the reactants and products.
Which should be adjusted in balancing a chemical equation, the subscripts or
the coefficients?
According to the law of conservation of mass, atoms are neither created nor
destroyed during a chemical reaction. As a result, the number of atoms of each
element should remain the same before and after the reaction. Therefore, the main
reason why all chemical equations must be balanced is just to obey the law of
conservation of mass.
To balance a chemical equation means to equalize the number of atoms on both sides
of the equation by putting appropriate coefficients in front of the formulas.
Only two methods of balancing chemical equations will be discussed under this topic.
These are the inspection and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) method.
1. The Inspection Method
Most simple chemical equations can be balanced using this method. Balancing an
equation by inspection means to adjust coefficients by trial and error until the equation
is balanced. Follow the following four steps to balance the chemical equation.
Step 1: Write the word equation.
Step 2: Write the correct symbols or formulas for the reactants and products.
Step 3: Place the smallest whole number coefficients in front of the symbols or
formulas until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides
of the equation.
104
Step 4: Checking: By counting the number of atoms on both sides of the equation,
make sure that the atoms of all elements are balanced and also the
coefficients are expressed as the smallest whole number ratio.
Note:
When you balance an equation, do not change any symbol or formula of any compound.
If you change a symbol or formula, it no longer represents the element or compound
required by the equation.
Example 1
Balance the equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to
produces magnesium oxide.
Solution:
Step 1: Magnesium + Oxygen — Magnesium oxide
Step 2: Mg +O, — MgoO (unbalanced)
Step 3: Put coefficients to balance the equation
¢ Oxygen is not balanced. There are two oxygen atoms on the left side and
one on the right side. Hence, place the coefficient 2 in front of MgO.
Mg +O, — 2MgO (unbalanced)
¢ Now Mg is not balanced. There is one Mg on the left side and two on the
right side. Thus, place the coefficient 2 in front of Mg.
2Mg +O, — 2MgoO (balanced)
Step 4: Checking: There are two Mg and two O atoms on each side of the
equation. Therefore, the equation is correctly balanced.
2Mg +O, > 2MgO
Exercise 4.2
Balance the following chemical equation, using the inspection method:
1. Na+ H,O — NaOH + H,
2. CaCO; — CaO + CO,
3. H,O, ~ H,O+ O,
4. Al+H,PO, — AIPO, + H,
5. HNO+ H,,S — NO+S+H,0
max
2. The LCM Method
In the LCM method, the coefficients for the balanced chemical equation are obtained
by taking the LCM of the total valency of reactants and products and then dividing it
by total valency of reactants and products. All the necessary steps to balance a
chemical equation by the LCM method, are shown by the following examples.
Example 2
When aluminium reacts with oxygen, aluminium oxide is formed. Write
the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.
Solution:
Step 1: Represent the reaction by a word equation.
Aluminium + Oxygen — Aluminium oxide
Step 2: Change the words to symbols and formulas for the reactants and
products.
Al+0, > ALO,
Step 3: Place the total valency of each atom above it.
3 4 6 6
Al+O, > AI, 0,
Now the equation shows
¢ The valency of aluminium as 3.
¢ The total valency of oxygen is 2 x 2 = 4.
* The total valency of aluminium in ALO, is 3 x 2=6.
* The total valency of oxygen in Al,O, is 2 x 3 = 6.
Step 4: Find the LCM of each total valency and place it above the arrow.
3 4 6 6
Al+O:. —,> ALO,
Step 5: Divide the LCM by each total valency number to obtain the coefficients
for each of the reactants and products. Place the obtained coefficients
in front of the respective formulas.
4Al + 30, — 2AL0, (balanced)
Checking: There are 4 aluminium and 6 oxygen atoms on both sides of the
equation. Hence, the chemical equation is correctly balanced.

Activity 4.6
Form a group and discuss each of the following phenomena:
When the bread baked,does the bread absorb or release heat energy? Justify your answer.
Present your conclusion to the class.
Almost all chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes. These energy
changes could be in the form of heat energy, light energy, electrical energy, and so on.
CHEMREAICTIONS ANDC STOICHIOAMETRY —L
On the basis of energy changes, chemical reactions can be divided into exothermic
and endothermic reactions.
Can heat energy be considered as a reactant or product?
Exothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction that releases heat energy to the surroundings is known as an
exothermic reaction. During an exothermic process, heat is given out from the system
to its surroundings and this heat energy is written on the right side of the equation as
shown below.
Reactants — Products + Heat
For example, the burning of carbon with oxygen produces carbon dioxide and heat is
released during the reaction. Thus, the reaction is exothermic and written as:
C+ O, > CO, + Heat
Endothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction which absorbs heat energy from the surroundings is known as an
endothermic reaction. During an endothermic process, heat flows into the system from
its surroundings and the heat is written on the left side of the equation.
Reactants + Heat — products
For example, the reaction between carbon and sulphur to form carbon disulphide is
an endothermic reaction because heat is absorbed in the reaction.
C+ 2S + Heat > CS,
The amount of heat energy liberated or absorbed by a chemical reaction is called heat
of reaction or change in enthalpy for the reaction. It is symbolized as AH. Its unit is
expressed in kilojoules per mol (KY ol): The change in enthalpy (A) is the difference
between the energy of the products and the energy of the reactants.
AH = A, — H_; where A, is the heat content (energy) of the product, /7, is the
heat content (energy) of the reactant.
For endothermic reactions, AH is positrve because the energy of the product is higher
than the energy of the reactant. As a result, the enthalpy of the system increases as
shown in Figure 4.3.
since, HTDp? H,, AH= positive (AH > 0)
For example, when nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide, 66.4 kJ of
heat energy is absorbed (i.e., AH = + 66.4 kJ/mol) and thus the reaction is
endothermic.
N, (g) + 20, (g) > 2NO, (g); AH = + 66.4 kJ/mol

For exothermic reactions, AH is negative because the energy of the reactants is
greater than the energy of the products. Thus, the enthalpy of the system decreases,
as shown in Figure 4.4.
Hi, < H, = AH = negative (AH < 0)
For example, when carbon burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, 393.5 kJ of
heat energy is liberated and hence the reaction is exothermic (AH = —393.5 kJ/mol).

Share your findings with the rest of the class.
Chemical reactions bring about chemical changes. All chemical changes are
accompanied by energy changes. This energy is usually in the form of heat, light, or
electricity.
Energy changes produced by chemical reactions have many practical applications
(uses). For example, energy lifts rockets, runs cars, and extracts metal from
compounds.
Many applications involve the energy produced by fuel combustion, which liberates
large amounts of heat. The energy can be converted from one form to another. For
example, the energy that fuel combustion produces can convert water to steam.
The steam can run a turbine that creates electricity.
Respiration (breathing) creates energy for our bodies. Breathing releases the energy
our living cells produce by oxidizing glucose. This energy helps to maintain our
body temperature and body exercises.

A reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single substance is
called a combination reaction. In a combination reaction, two elements, two compounds,
or an element and a compound react to form a single compound. Combination
reactions can be represented by the following general form of equation.
A+B — AB;
where the reactants A and B are elements or compounds, the product AB is a compound.
Such type of reaction is also known as synthesis or composition reaction.

A decomposition reaction is a reaction that involves the breaking down of a single
compound into two or more elements or simpler compounds. A decomposition
reaction can be carried out using heat, light, electricity or a catalyst. But most
decomposition reactions are carried out when heat is supplied and this heat energy is
indicated by a ‘delta’ (A) symbol above the arrow. The general form of equation for
a decomposition reaction is:
AB > A+B
where the reactant AB must be a compound and the products A and B could be
elements or compounds.

A reaction in which one element displaces another element from its compound is
known as single displacement or replacement reaction. Such a reaction is represented
by the following two general forms.
A+BC > B+t+AC
If A is a metal, it will displace B to form AC, provided A is a more active metal
than B.
A+BC > BA+T+C
If A is a non-metal, it will displace C to form BA, provided A is a more active
non-metal than C.
— @ chemistaveraDeS
In general, a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from a
compound.
Examples of single-displacement reactions
a Active metals displace hydrogen from acids.
Reactive metals such as potassium, calcium, sodium, and zinc displace hydrogen
gas from dilute acids.
For example, zinc is an active metal, and it displaces hydrogen from hydrochloric
acid; but copper metal cannot do so.

@ cewistevcrADES
The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced chemical
equation is known as stoichiometry. In other words, stoichiometry is the study of the
amount or ratio of moles, mass, energy and volumes (for gases) of reactants and
products. Stoichiometric calculations are based on the following two major principles.
i) The composition of any substance in the chemical equation should be expressed
by a definite formula.
ii) The law of conservation of mass must be obeyed (the mass of reactants equals
the mass of products).
From a balanced chemical equation, it is possible to determine the:
¢ number of moles of each reactant and product; and
e relative mass of each of the reactants and products
For example, in the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water, 2 moles of
H, combines with 1 mole of O, to yield 2 moles of H,O. The equation also tells us
4 g of hydrogen reacts with 32 g of oxygen to produce 36 g of water. This can be
further interpreted as follows:
2H(g) + Og) 2 2H,0()
Mole — 2 mole 1 mole 2 mole
Molecule — 2 molecule 1 molecule 2 molecule
Mass> 4g8 32 g 2x 18g
36 g reactant 36 g product
Calculations based on chemical equations (stoichiometric problems) are classified
into mass-mass problem, volume-volume problems and mass-volume problems.
In mass-mass problems, the mass of one substance is given, and the mass of the
second substance is determined from the same reaction. There are two methods for
solving such types of problems:
i) Mass-ratio method
ii) Mole-ratio method
Let us see each method by using the necessary steps.
i) The mass-ratio method
In this type of stoichiometric calculation, the mass of one substance is determined
from the given mass of the other substance using the following steps.
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Place the given mass above the corresponding formula, and x above the
formula of the substance whose mass is to be determined.
Step 3: Write the total molar mass of the substances below the formula of each
substance. (Zotal molar mass is the molar mass of the substance
multiplied by its coefficient).
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown mass, x.
Example 1
How many grams of calcium chloride are formed when 15 g of calcium metal
reacts with hydrochloric acid?
Solution:
Step 1: Ca + 2HCl — CaCl, + H,
15g
Step 2: Ca+ 2HC] > CaCl, + H,
Step 3: CSga+ 2HCl > CaCl, + H,
Step 4: Ig _ *
40g Illlg
Step 5: x = 41.63 g
Therefore, 41.63 g of CaCl, is produced.

2452 96g
Step 5: x = 56.8 g
ii) The mole-ratio method
The mole ratio is the ratio between the numbers of moles of any two substances in a
given reaction. In this method, the given mass is converted into moles, and the number
of moles for the required substance is calculated. If needed, convert the obtained
moles back to mass.
Follow the steps given below to solve problems of mass-mass relationships by the
mole ratio method:
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Convert the given mass to moles and write the obtained moles and the
required quantity, x, above the formulas of the respective substances.
Step 3: Place the coefficients as the number of moles under the formula of each
substance involved.
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown value, x; and convert the moles obtained into mass.
Example 3
How many grams of sodium metal are needed to react with 10.0 g of water?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Na + 2H,O — 2NaOH + H,
given mass 10.0g

Step 5: x = 0.56 mol of Na
Now, convert 0.56 mole of Na to grams
mass of Na= mole x molar mass
= 0.56 mol x 23 g/mol
= 12.88 g
Therefore, 12.88 g of sodium metal is needed to react with 10 g of water.
Example 4

magnesium nitrate?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Mg (NO,), — 2MgO + 4NO, + O,

Step 5: x = 2.46 moles of NO,

Therefore, 113.2 g of NO, is produced.

reaction that produces 0.05 moles of O,?
6. How many moles of CaO are needed to react with excess water to produce
370 g of calcium hydroxide?
In reactions involving gases, the volume of gases can be determined on the principle
that 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 litres at STP (standard
temperature and pressure, STP, the temperature is 0°C and the pressure is I atm).
It is also known that 22.4 L of any gas weighs exactly its molecular mass at STP. This
volume, 22.4 litres, of a gas is known as the molar volume.
At STP, 1 mole of any gas = 22.4 L = gram volume mass of the gas
The relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of different gases,
under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain equal number of
molecules. This law can also be stated as the volume of a gas is proportional to the
number of molecules (moles) of the gas at STP.

KCIO, at STP?
5. How many moles of water vapour are formed when 10 litres of butane gas,

In mass-volume problems, either the mass of one substance is given and the volume
of the other is required or the volume of one substance is given and the mass of the
other one is required. The steps to solve such type of problems are the same as the
previous steps except putting the masses on one side and the volumes on the other
side of the equality sign.

4.6.5 Limiting and Excess Reactants
When all the reactants are completely consumed in a chemical reaction, then such
reactants are said to be in stoichiometric proportions. But, practically these types of
chemical reactions do not always occur. In many cases, an excess of one or more
131
reactants is encountered in the reaction and the other reactant is completely converted
into products. Thus, the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction is known
as the limiting reactant, because it limits or determines the amount of products that can
be formed.
For example, consider the following reaction:
H, + Cl, ~ 2HCI
1 mole 1 mole 2 moles
According to the equation, 1 mole of H, reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2
mole of HCl. Thus, all the reactants are completely consumed and only products
appear. However if 1 mole of H, reacts with 1.5 mole of Cl,, there is insufficient H,
to react with all of the Cl,. Therefore, Cl, will be in excess and H, will be the limiting
reactant. Only 2 moles of HCl are formed and at the end of the reaction 0.5 mole of
Cl, remains unreacted.
Example 8
How much ammonia is produced if 10 g of hydrogen reacts with 18 g of
nitrogen?
Solution:
3H,(g) + N,(g) > 2NH,(g)
First determine the number of moles;
Moles of H, = 10© — 5 mol
2 g/mol
18g
Moles of N, = 28 g/mol = 0.64 mol
Now, calculate the number of moles or masses of the product that would be
formed by each reactant.
The reactant that gives the smallest amount of product is the limiting reactant.
i. Using the quantity of H, ii. Using the quantity of N,

= 56.6 g =21.8¢
CHEMICAL REACTIONS ANDSTOICHIOMETRY =
a
Therefore, the limiting reactant is nitrogen, because it gives less amount of
NH,, z.e., 21.8 g NH,. In the reaction, 0.64 mole (18 g) of N, is consumed.
Hydrogen is in excess. The amount of hydrogen consumed will be:
x 18g x 0.64 mol
3H,+N, > 2NH, oe 3H, + N, — 2NH,
6g 28g 3moles 1mole
x 18 x _ 0.64mol
6 7 28 3 mol lmol
x = 3.86 g of H, x = 1.92 mol of H,
Therefore, 3.86 g or 1.92 moles of H, is used in the reaction, and 6.14 g or
3.08 moles of H, is left unreacted.
Example 9
In the chemistry laboratory, a student performed a displacement reaction by
adding 9.5 g of zinc into 9.5 g of HCl in a beaker. What weight of ZnCl, will
be produced?

Even though the given masses of the two reactants are the same, they are not
mixed in equimolar ratio as shown above. Thus, the limiting reactant must be
determined first.

Hence, the limiting reactant is HCI.
Mass of ZnCl, = 0.13 mol = 136 g/mol = 17.68 g ZnCl,

5. For the reaction:
2Al + 3H,SO, — AL(SO,), + 3H,
How many grams of hydrogen are produced if 0.8 mole of aluminium reacts
with 1.0 mole of sulphuric acid?
The measured amount of product obtained in any chemical reaction is known as the
actual yield. The theoretical yield is the calculated amount of product that would be
obtained if the reaction proceeds completely. The actual yield (experimentally
determined yield) of a product is usually less than the theoretical yield (calculated
yield).
The percentage yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield multiplied by
100.
Percentage yield = Acutal * yield x 100

Activity 4.10
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon:
When you dry your meal dishes with a towel, the towel can be termed as a drying agent
and the dish as wetting agent. What happens to the towel and the dish, in terms of
getting wet and dry, after cleaning? Relate this idea with oxidizing agent and reducing
agent, oxidation and reduction of substances. Present your conclusion to the class.
In our day to day activity, we are familiar with the chemical processes like rusting of
iron, burning of substances, breathing of air, digestion of food and so on. All such
types of processes or reactions are known as oxidation and reduction or redox
reactions.
Can oxidation take place without reduction?
Oxidation: is the process in which a substance loses electrons in a chemical reaction.
For example, in the reaction
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
CHEMREAICTIONS ANDC STOICHIOAMETRY —L
Each sodium atom has lost one electron and has turned to a sodium ion.
Hence, sodium is oxidized.
Na+ le — Na*
Reduction: is the process in which a substance gains electrons in a chemical
reaction.
For example, in the above reaction each chlorine atom has gained an
electron and has changed to chloride ion. Thus, chlorine is reduced;
Cl, +2e > Cr
The processes of oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously because if one
substance loses electrons, the other substance must gain these electrons. Since the
process of oxidation and reduction involves the transfer of electrons, it also results in
the changes of oxidation number. Thus, oxidation and reduction can also be defined in
terms of oxidation number. Oxidation is an increase in the oxidation number of an
element and reduction is a decrease in the oxidation number. For example, in the
reaction,
0 0 +1 -1
Na+Cl, — 2NaCl
Reduced t ,
Oxidized
The oxidation number of sodium is increased from 0 to +1 and thus sodium is
oxidized. The oxidation number of chlorine is decreased from 0 to —1, and therefore
chlorine is reduced.
Oxidation number or oxidation state is the number of electrons that an atom appears
to have gained or lost when it is combined with other atoms.
| Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Rule 1: The oxidation number of all elements in free state is zero. This rule is also
applied for diatomic or polyatomic elements.
Example: The oxidation number of Na = 0, Cu = 0, Cl in CL, = 0, O in
O, = 0, S in S, = 0.
Rule 2: The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
Example: Na* = +1, Mg** = +2, S?- = -2.
Rule 3: The oxidation number of oxygen in a compound is usually — 2 except in the
following cases:
137
Exceptions
The oxidation number of oxygen in:
i) peroxides is —1. Example: Na,O,
ii) superoxides is —1/2. Example: KO,
iii) oxygen diflouride is +2. Example: OF,
Rule 4: The oxidation number of hydrogen in its entire compounds is +1 except
in metal hydrides, (like NaH, CaH, and AIH,), where its oxidation
number is —1.
Rule 5: The sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a neutral compound is
Zero.
Example: 1,50, ((+2) + (+6) + C8) = 0)
Rule 6: Ina polyatomic ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers of the constituent
atoms equals the charge on the ion.
Example: (§0,)?_ ((+6) + (8) = -2)
Rule 7: Elements of group IA have +1 and group ITA have +2 oxidation states in all
of their compounds.
Rule 8: In a compound, the more electronegative element is assigned a negative
oxidation number, and the less electronegative element is assigned a positive
oxidation number.
+3 -1
Example: NCl, (chlorine is more electronegative than nitrogen)
Example 1
What is the oxidation number of chromium in Na,Cr,O,?
Solution:
The oxidation number of O is —2 (Rule 3)
The oxidation number of Na is +1 (Rule 7)
Let the oxidation number of Cr be x.
+] x 2
Na, Cr, O,
Since the sum of the oxidation numbers of Na, Cr, and O in Na,Cr,O, is 0
(Rule 5)
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY -
Then, Na, Cr, O2,
(1 x 2) +(e x 2)+ (27=)0
2+ 2x14 -=0
x =+6
Therefore, the oxidation number of Cr in Na,Cr,O, is +6.
Example 2
What is the oxidation number of manganese in MnO,,?
Solution :
Let the oxidation number of Mn be x.
[vin 0: )
The sum of the oxidation numbers of Mn and O in MnO, is —1 (Rule 6)
x + (2 x 4) =-l
x-8 =-l
x =+7
Therefore, the oxidation number of Mn in MnO; is +7.
Example 3
Determine the oxidation number of phosphorus in Ca(H,PO,),.
Solution:
The oxidation number of Ca is +2 (Rule 7).
Let, the oxidation number of P be x.
C+a2 f 1+] rxo-,2 |
2
+2 + (4 x (+1) + 2 x x) + (8 x 2) = 0
2+4+2x-16=0
2x -10 = 0 or x =+5
Hence, the oxidation number of P in Ca(H,PO,), ao is +5.

In a redox reaction, the substance that causes another substance to get oxidized, but
itself gets reduced, is known as an oxidizing agent, or oxidant. In the same manner,
the substance that causes another substance to get reduced, but itself oxidized, is
referred to as a reducing agent or reductant.
¢ QOxidizing agents are substances that:
— are reduced (gain electrons)
— contain elements whose oxidation number decreases
¢ Reducing agents are substances that:
— are oxidized (lose electrons)
— contain elements whose oxidation number increases
Tests for an oxidizing agent are accomplished by mixing it with a substance which is
easily oxidized to give a visible colour change when the reaction takes place.
CHEMREAICTIONS ANCD STOICHIOAMETRY L
For example,
i) Permanganate ion (MnO,) in acidic solution changes colour from purple to
colourless.
MnO; — Mn?*
Dichromate in acidic solution changes colour from orange to green.
Cr,0,7 2- — Cr3e
Other common oxidizing agents are chlorine, potassium chromate, sodium chlorate
and manganese (IV) oxide.
Similarly, certain reducing agents undergo a visible colour change with a substance
which is easily reduced.
For example,
i) A moist starch solution changes potassium iodide paper to blue-black to show
that iodine is formed, 21” — I,. That is potassium iodide is a reducing agent.
ii) Hydrogen sulphide bubbled through a solution of an oxidizing agent forms a
yellow precipitate, S*~ — S. That is H,S is a reducing agent.
Other common reducing agents are carbon, carbon monoxide, sodium
thiosulphate, sodium sulphite and iron (II) salts.
The oxidizing or reducing ability of substances depend on many factors. Some
of these are:
Electronegativity: Elements with high electronegativity such as F,, O,, N., and
Cl, are good oxidizing agents. Elements with low electronegativity for example,
metallic elements like Na, K, Mg and Al are good reducing agents.
Oxidation states: In a compound or ion, if one of its elements is in a higher
oxidation state, then it is an oxidizing agent. Similarly, if an element of a compound
or ion is in a lower oxidation state, then it is a reducing agent..

4.7.4 Analysing Redox Reactions
Oxidation and reduction reactions are called Redox reactions. Oxidation and
reduction reaction take place simultaneously in a given reaction.
Activity 4.11
Form a group and discuss the following:
1. Why a reducing agent undergoes oxidation?
2. Why must every redox reaction involve both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent?
Present your discussion to the class.
Example 4
Identify the oxidizing agent, reducing agent, the substance oxidized and reduced
in the following reaction.
H,S + Br, > 2HBr+S
Solution:
Let us assign oxidation number to all the elements of the reactants and products.
+12 0 +1-1 0
H,S + Br, —»> 2HBr+S
| Reduced |
Oxidized
In the reaction, the S atom in H,S increases its oxidation number from —2 to
Q. Hence, S is oxidized and H,S is a reducing agent. The oxidation number of
Br is decreased from 0 to —1. Thus, Br, is reduced and is an oxidizing agent.
Example 5
Write the oxidizing and reducing agents for the reaction given below:
Cu + HNO, — Cu(NO,), + NO + H,O
Solution:
Write the oxidation numbers of each element and identify the substances which
undergo a change in oxidization number.
O +14+5-2 +2 45-2 42-2 41-2
Cu +HNO,— Cu (NO,), + NO + HO
+ Reduced
Oxidized
Therefore, copper is a reducing agent, and HNO, is an oxidizing agent.
Non-redox Reactions
So far we have discussed oxidation and reduction reaction or redox reactions.
However, there are also reactions in which oxidation and reduction do not occur and
such types of reactions are known as non-redox reactions.
In non-redox reactions, no electrons are exchanged between the reacting substances.
Therefore, the oxidation numbers of the atoms do not change in the reaction. Usually such
types of reactions involve the exchange of positive and negative ions. Most of the double
displacement reactions and acid-base reactions are not oxidation-reduction reactions.

Observations and analysis:
1. What happens to the mass during the reaction?
2. Write the balanced chemical equation.
Every chemical reaction proceeds at different rates or speed. Some reactions proceed
very slowly and may take a number of days to complete; while others are very rapid,
requiring only a few seconds.
The rate of a chemical reaction measures the decrease in concentration of a reactant
or the increase in concentration of a product per unit time. This means that the rate of
a reaction determines how fast the concentration of a reactant or product changes
with time. The rate of a reaction is obtained by determining the concentration of
reactants or products during the reaction. Methods for determining the concentration
of reactants or products depend on the type of reactions. Some of the methods are:
Colour (changes in colour)
Pressure (increase or decrease in pressure, particularly in gases)
Volume (increase or decrease in size, particularly in gases)
2
fF
o0
a Mass (gain or loss in weight)
e Amount of precipitate formed
Generally, the rate of a reaction can be obtained by measuring either one of the above
changes in properties of substances and consequently relating to changes in their
concentrations during the course of the reaction.
Change in concentration of substance _ AC
Rate of reaction = —

From this expression, it follows that the rate of a reaction is inversely proportional to
the time taken by the reaction.

Figure 4.12 illustrates the changes of the rate of a chemical reaction with time. A
reaction becomes slower as reactants are consumed. The reaction rate curve becomes
less steep until it becomes a horizontal straight line. No more reactant is used up at
this point.

that the total volume of the gas evolved can be measured at fixed intervals.
Pre-conditions for a Chemical Reaction
Chemical reactions are usually explained by the collision theory. The assumption of the
collision theory is that chemical reactions take place due to the collision between
molecules.
1. Collisions between reactants
The first precondition for a reaction to occur is the direct contact of the reacting
substance with each other. However, all collisions between molecules are not
necessarily effective in bringing a reaction.
2. Activation energy
If the collisions between the reactant molecules do not have sufficient energy, then no
reaction will occur. Therefore, for the reaction to take place collision must always
occur with sufficient energy to break the bonds in the reactants and form new bonds
in the product. Thus, minimum amount of energy needed for the reaction is known as
activation energy.
3. Proper Orientation
Collision of molecules with sufficient activation energy will not bring a reaction if the
reacting molecules are poorly oriented. Thus, the collision between molecules should
have the proper orientation.
147
@ cHemistayeraDES
Consider the reaction between H, and CL, molecules:
H,+Cl, > 2HCI
For the reaction to occur, first H, and Cl, molecules must collide with each other. For
the collision to be effective, these colliding molecules (H., and Cl,) must have sufficient
energy to break the H — H and Cl — Cl bonds and consequently to form new H — Cl
bonds.
Unless, the H, and Cl, molecules are oriented in proper positions, there is no product
formed. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4.13(c) the H, and Cl, molecules rearrange
themselves so as to form a new H — Cl molecule.

Factors Affecting the Rates of Chemical Reaction
Activity 4.13
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1. How is the burning of charcoal affected by:
a_ increasing the amount of air used
b adding more charcoal.
2. How can you increase the rate of combustion of a given block of wood ?
Present your findings to the class.
Form a group and compare the rate of combustion of the following substances:
a paper c wood charcoal
b kerosene d copper
Present your findings to the class.
The rate of a chemical reaction depends on nature of reactants, temperature, and
concentration of reactants, surface area and catalysts.
The collision theory assumes that the rate of a reaction depends on the number
(frequency) of collisions of particles and those factors which affect the frequency of
collisions will also affect the rate of a reaction. Now let us discuss each factor.
1. Nature of the reactants
The rate of a reaction is influenced by the type and nature of the reacting substances.
For example, the following reactions have different rates due to the nature of the
reactants, Mg, Fe and Cu.
Mg + 2HCl + MgCl, + H, ... (very fast reaction)
Fe + 2HCl — FeCl, + H, ... (slow reaction)
Cu + HCl — No reaction
2. Temperature
An increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction. This is because as the
temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases which in
turn increases the number of effective collisions.
In general, for many chemical reactions, the rate of a reaction doubles for every 10°C
rise in temperature.
3. Concentration of reactants
The number of collisions is proportional to the concentration of reactants. The higher
the concentration of the reactants, the more collisions between the reacting particles
and thus the higher the rate of the reaction.
For example, if you heat a piece of steel wool in air (21% oxygen by volume) it burns
slowly. But in pure oxygen (100% oxygen by volume) it bursts in to a dazzling white
flame. This indicates that the rate of burning increases as the concentration of oxygen
is higher.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY ; »
4. Surface area
When the reactants are in different phases, be it solid, liquid or gas, then the surface
area of the substances affect the rate of the reaction. The higher the surface area of
reactants, the faster is the rate of the reaction. This is because more contact results in
more collisions between each small particle of reactants.

What is the difference between positive and negative catalysts? Explain the

In the previous chapters, we came across chemical reactions in which all the reactants
are completely converted to products. Such types of reactions are known as
irreversible reactions. Irreversible reactions proceed only in one direction (forward
direction) and expressed by a single arrow (—>).
Examples
2Na+ Cl, > 2NaCl
2KCIO, > 2KCl + 30,
However, there are many chemical reactions that do not proceed to completion. The
products at the same time react to give (produce) the reactants. These are called
reversible reactions.
Reversible reactions take place in both the forward and backward directions under
the same conditions. A double arrow (<——) or (——) pointing in opposite
directions is used in such reaction equations.
Example
N,+3H, —= 2NH,
The forward reaction proceeds from left to right and the reaction that goes from right
to left is the reverse reaction.
Does a reaction stop if it attains equilibrium?
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a chemical system in which the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions are equal. At the state of chemical equilibrium, there is
no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products because the system is in
dynamic equilibrium. Dynamic equilibrium means the reaction does not stop and both
the forward and the backward reactions continue at equal rates.
At equilibrium, Rate of forward reaction = Rate of reverse reaction
The law of chemical equilibrium can be expressed mathematically using the molar
concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. The concentration of species
is denoted by enclosing the formula in square bracket [ ].
Thus, for the reversible reaction:
Rate of forward reaction = Kf [A]? [B]? where Kf and K,, are rate constants for the
Rate of reverse reaction = K,, [C]° [D]? forward and reverse reactions respectively.
CHEMREIACTIONS ANCDSTOICHIOAMETRY, =L}
Since at equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse
reaction, it follows:
K, [A}* [B]’ = K, [C]* [DI
Solving for the constants, K,/K,, gives a new constant, termed as the equilibrium
constant, K, q
Therefore, Ka, = = a c] a { h pI}

Factors that Affect Chemical Equilibrium
Activity 4.18
Form a group and try to explore at least two properties that can be utilize to determine
the state of chemical equilibrium in system.
Present your findings to the class.
A system remains at a state of chemical equilibrium if there is no change in the
external conditions that disturb the equilibrium. But the point of equilibrium could be
affected due to any external factors like temperature, pressure, concentration and so
on. How a system at equilibrium adjusts itself to any of these changes is stated by the
French chemist Henri Le Chatelier in 1888.
Le Chatelier states that if a stress is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system
will respond in such a way to counteract the stress. The stress could be change in
temperature, concentration or pressure.
The factors affecting chemical equilibrium and their effects:
1. Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature changes on equilibrium depends on whether the reaction is
exothermic or endothermic. An increase in the temperature of a system will favour an
endothermic reaction and a decrease in temperature favors an exothermic reaction.
For example, consider the following reaction:
H,O(g) + CO(g) == H,(g) + CO,(g); AH = — 41 kJ
Since the reaction is exothermic,
i) if temperature is increased, the system will shift to the left.
ii) if temperature is decreased, the system will shift to the right and a high yield of
products (H, and CO,) is obtained.

2. Effect of Pressure or Volume
Pressure changes only affect equilibrium reaction involving gaseous reactants and
products. The effect of pressure on liquids and solids is negligible. An increase in
pressure (or decrease in volume) on a gaseous system shifts the equilibrium in the
direction of forming smaller number of moles of gas. On the contrary, decreasing the
pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction of forming more number of moles of the
gas. For example, in the reaction,
2CO(+ gO,()g) ——_ 2C0,(g)
N ——
3 moles of gases 2 moles of gases
There are 3 moles of reactants and 2 moles of product.
Therefore, increasing the pressure of the system shifts the equilibrium to the forward
direction. This results in a higher yield of CO,. Decreasing the pressure of the gaseous
mixture shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction.
When the number of moles of reactants and products are equal, pressure has no
effect on the equilibrium. For example, in the following reaction;
H, (g) +1, (g) == 2HI(g)
2 moles of gases 2 molesof gases
the number of moles of reactants and products are equal (2 mol each) and hence no
effect of pressure on the equilibrium.
Exercise 4.16
For the following equilibrium system, how would the position of the equilibrium be
changed if:
a the temperature is increased; b_ the pressure is decreased?
c the temperature is increased, and d_ the pressure is decreased

N,O,(g) + heat —= 2NO,(g)
PCL(g) + CL(g) == PCI,(g) + 21 kJ

3. Effect of Concentration
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, any change in the concentration of a reactant or
product will lead to a change in the concentration of the substances on the other side
of the equation.
If one of the reactants is added to the equilibrium mixture, the system shifts to the
forward direction and a high yield of product is obtained. To the contrary, if more
product is added to the system, the equilibrium shifts to the reverse direction. For
example, in the reaction,
N, + 3H, == 2NH,
If the concentration of N, or H, is increased (1.e., if more N, or H, is added), the
equilibrium will shift to the right direction and more NH, will be produced.
4. Effect of catalysts
Catalysts change the speed of both the forward and reverse reactions equally.
However, catalysts do not affect the state of chemical equilibrium of a reaction. This
means that the position of equilibrium will not be shifted due to the presence of a
catalyst.
How can Le-Chatelier’s principle help in maximizing the yields of products
in industrial production?
Many industrial reactions are reversible reactions. The Haber and contact processes
provide excellent illustrations of the effects of temperature, pressure and catalyst on
the equilibrium systems.
A Haber process (the industrial production of ammonia). In the Haber
process, ammonia (NH) is industrially manufactured using gaseous nitrogen
and hydrogen.
N,(g) + 3H, = 2NH,(g); AH = — 92 kJ/mol
t
High yield of ammonia is produced by decreasing the temperature and
increasing the pressure of the system.
However, the yield per unit time is highly increased by using an iron catalyst.
B Contact process (the industrial production of sulphuric acid). Similarly, in
the contact process, sulphuric acid (H,SO,) is commercially manufactured by
the reaction of SO, and O,. The resulting SO, is then converted to H,SO,.

CHEMREAICTIONS ANCD STOICHIOAMETRY L
Stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products.
Mass-mass problems, mass-volume and volume-volume problems are the
main types of stoichiometric calculations.
Oxidation is the process where a substance loses electron (s) or increases
its oxidation number.
Reduction is the process where a substance gains electron (s) or decreases
its oxidation number.
Oxidizing agents are the substances reduced, and reducing agents are the
substances oxidized.
Rate of reaction is the change in concentration of reactants or products
with time.
Reversible reactions take place in both the forward and backward directions.
Irreversible reactions proceed only in the forward direction.
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a chemical reaction in which the rate

Le Chatlier’s principle states that when an equilibrium is subjected to a
stress, the system will shift in a direction so as to relieve the stress.
The chemical equilibrium is affected by temperature, pressure, and
concentrations.

1. Name two examples for each of solids, liquids and gases.
2. What happens when you heat an ice cube?
You recall that all object around us is called matter. Matter is defined as anything that
occupies space and has mass. It can exist in the form of gas, liquid and solid. The
simplest example is the water we use in our daily life. The three physical states of
water are:
¢ Steam, water in the form of gas.
¢ Water, in the form of liquid.
¢ Ice, water in the form of solid.
The changes of the states of matter are our every day experience. That is, ice melts
and water freezes; water boils and steam condenses.
The physical state of a given sample of matter depends on the temperature and
pressure. Changing these conditions or variables may change the behaviour of the
substances as solids, liquids or gases.
Solid
A solid has a definite shape and a definite volume. Solids are almost completely
incompressible and have very high average density. A high average density reflects the
fact that the particles within solids are usually packed closer than those in liquids or
gases do. The tightly packed particles of solids are also highly organized.
The particles of a solid, whether they are atoms, ions or molecules only vibrate about
a fixed point with respect to the neighboring particles. Because of these, the particles
maintain a fixed position; for example substances like metals, wood, coal and stone,
are solids.
mx?¢ _ CHEMISTRYGRADES
Liquid
A liquid has a definite volume, but does not have a definite shape. Liquids take the
shape of their container. This is explained in terms of arrangement of particles. In the
liquid state, particles vibrate about a point, and constantly shift their positions relative
to their neighbours. At room temperature, water, ethanol, benzene and oil are liquids.
Gas
A gas has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. This is because its particles
are virtually independent of one another. For example, air, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide and nitrogen are gases.
Plasma
Besides, solid, liquid and gas, there exists a fourth-state of matter at very high
temperature (million degrees Celsius). At such high temperatures molecules cannot
exist. Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons. This state of matter, a
gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is called plasma. Because of the
extreme temperatures needed for fusion, no material can exist in the plasma state.

2. In which state do the particles possess the highest kinetic energy?
The three states of matter in which substances are chemically the same but physically
different are explained by the kinetic theory of matter. The kinetic theory of matter gives
an explanation of the nature of the motion and the heat energy. According to the kinetic
theory of matter, every substance consists of a very large number of very small particles
called ions, atoms and molecules. The particles are in a state of continuous and random
motion with all possible velocities. The motion of the particles increases with a rise in
temperature.
Generally, the kinetic theory of matter is based on the following three assumptions:
1. All matter is composed of particles which are in constant motion.
2. The particles possess kinetic energy and potential energy.
3. The difference between the three states of matter is due to their energy contents
and the motion of the particles.

@ cHemistaveraDES
As discussed earlier, matter exists as gas, liquid, and solid. Their properties are
explained in terms of the kinetic theory as follows:
Properties of Gases
From the kinetic molecular theory of gases, the following general properties of gases
can be summarized.
1. Gases have no definite shape and definite volume. This is because gases assume
the volume and shape of their containers.
Gases can be easily compressed. By applying pressure to the walls of a flexible
container, gases can be compressed; the compression results in a decrease in
volume. This happens due to the large spaces between the particles of gases.
Gases have low densities compared with liquids and solids. This is due to the
fact that the particles of a gas are very far apart and the number of molecules
per unit volume is very small. A small mass of a gas in a large volume results in
a very low density.
Gases exert pressure in all directions. Gases that are confined in a container
exert pressure on the walls of their container. This pressure is due to collisions
between gas molecules and the walls of the container.
Gases easily flow and diffuse through one another. A gas moves freely and
randomly throughout in a given space.
Properties of Liquids
Liquids can be characterized by the following properties.
I. Liquids have a definite volume, but have no definite shape. They assume the
shapes of their container. Lack of a definite shape for liquid substances arises
from its low intermolecular forces as compared to that of solids.
Liquids have higher densities than gases. Their density is a result of the close
arrangement of liquid particles. Thus, the particles of liquids are closer than
those of gases. This accounts for the higher densities of liquids as compared to
gases.
Liquids are slightly compressible. With very little free spaces between their particles
liquids resist an applied external force and thus are compressed very slightly.
Liquids are fluids. A fluid is a substance that can easily flow. Most liquids naturally
flow downhill because of gravity. Because liquids flow readily the molecules of
a liquid can mix with each other. They flow much more slowly than gases.
Properties of Solids
1. Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume. This is due to the strong
force of attraction that holds the particles of solids together.
PHYSICALSTATMEATTESR —OF
2. Solids generally have higher densities than gases and liquids. The particles of
solids are very close to each other. There is almost no empty space between
the particles of solids. This closeness of particles makes solids to have more
particles (mass) per unit volume, and hence solids have high density.
Solids are extremely difficult to compress. This is because of the high interparticle
forces, and a very short distance between the particles.
Solids are not fluids. That is they normally do not flow. This is due to the fact
that solid particles are rigidly held in position by strong forces that cause the
restricted motion of their particles.

The particles in an ideal gas are very widely spaced and they are in a constant
random motion. The pressure of a gas is the result of continuous collisions between
the particles and the walls of their container.
170
— RYSICAL STATES OF MATTER >
Assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases
1. The particles are in a state of constant, continuous, rapid, random motion and,
therefore, possess kinetic energy. The motion is constantly interrupted by collisions
with molecules or with the container. The pressure of a gas is the effect of these
molecular impacts.
2. The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the
gas. Gases are composed of separate, tiny invisible particles called molecules.
Since these molecules are so far apart, the total volume of the molecules is
extremely small compared with the total volume of the gas. Therefore, under
ordinary conditions, the gas consists chiefly of empty space. This assumption
explains why gases are so easily compressed and why they can mix so readily.
3. The attractive forces between the particles are negligible. There are no forces of
attraction or repulsion between gas particles. You can think of an ideal gas
molecule as behaving like small billiard balls. When they collide, they do not
stick together but immediately bounce apart.
4. The average kinetic energy of gas particles depends on the temperature of the
gas. At any particular moment, the molecules in a gas have different velocities.
The mathematical formula for kinetic energy is K.E. = /% mv7, where m is mass
and v is velocity of gas molecules. Because the molecules have different velocities,
they have different kinetic energies. However, it is assumed that the average
kinetic energy of the molecules is directly proportional to the absolute (Kelvin)
temperature of the gas.
Activity 5.6
Form a group and discuss the following phenomena in terms of the gas laws. Present your
conclusion to the class.
a_ The increase in pressure in an automobile tire on a hot day.
b The loud noise heard when a light bulb shatters.
The gas laws are the products of many experiments on the physical properties of
gases, which were carried out over hundreds of years. The observation of Boyle and
other scientists led to the development of the Gas Laws. The gas laws express
mathematical relationships between the volume, temperature, pressure, and quantity of
a gas.
Pressure: pressure is defined as the force applied per unit area.
Force
Pressure =
Area
Pressure is one of the measurable properties of gases. Thus, the pressure of a gas can
be expressed in unit of atmosphere, Pascal, torr, millimetre of mercury. The SI unit of
pressure is Pascal (Pa), and is defined as one Newton per square metre.
1 Pa = 1 N/m? and
1 atm = 760 mmHg = 76 cmHg = 760 torr = 101325 Pa = 101.325 kPa
Volume: Volume is the space taken up by a body. The SI unit of volume is the cubic
metre (m?). Volume is also expressed in cubic centimetre (cm?) and cubic decimetre
(dm). Other common units of volume are millilitre (mL) and litre (L).
1 cm? = (1x10? m)? = 1«10°° m?
1 dm? = (1x107! mj = 1x107 m? = 1 L
A litre is equivalent to one cubic decimeter: The relation is given as follows
1 L= 1000 mL = 1000 cm? = 1 dm?
Temperature: Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Three
temperature scales are commonly used. These are °F (degree Fahrenheit), °C (degree
Celsius) and K (Kelvin). In all gas calculations, we use the Kelvin scale of
temperature.
We use the following formulae for all necessary inter-conversions:

Molar Volume and Standard Conditions (STP)
The conditions of a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 0°C (273.14 K)
are called standard temperature and pressure or STP for gases. At STP the volume of
one mole of any gas is equal to 22.4 litres. This volume is known as molar gas
volume.
Quantity of gas: The quantity of a gas is expressed in mole (7). Mole is the quantity
of gas in terms of number of particles. It is the number of atoms or molecules in
| gram-atom or | gram-molecule of an element or a compound.

Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. Present your discussion to the class.
Explain why a helium weather balloon expands as it rises more in the air. (Assume the
temperature remains constant.)
The first quantitative experiments on gases were performed by the Irish chemist,
Robert Boyle (1627-1691). His experiment helped to analyze the relationship
between the volume and pressure of a fixed amount of a gas at constant temperature.
Decreasing the external pressure, causes the gas to expand and to increase in volume.
Correspondingly, increasing the external pressure allows the gas to contract and
decrease in volume. This is shown in Figure 5.1,

Boyle studied the relationship between the pressure of the trapped gas and its volume.
Accordingly, he discovered that at constant temperature doubling the pressure on a
173
@ cHemistayeraDES
sample of gas reduces its volume by one-half. Tripling the gas pressure reduces its
volume to one-third of the original. Generally, the volume of a gas decreases, as the
pressure on the gas increases. This volume-pressure relationship is illustrated in
Table 5.1.

The general volume-pressure relationship illustrated above is called Boyle's law.
Boyle's law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional
to the pressure at a constant temperature. The inverse relationship between
pressure and volume is mathematically given as

In 1787, Jacques Charles investigated quantitative relationship between the volume
and temperature of a fixed quantity of gas which is held at constant pressure.
This can be related to real life by using an empty balloon. Accordingly, if we take a
balloon filled with air and place it on boiling water, the volume of the balloon visibly
increases as shown in Figure 5.4(b). If we take the balloon and place it in the freezer

compartment of our refrigerator, its volume shrinks drastically as the air inside cools
(Figure 5.4(c)).

From your observation what can you conclude about the effect of temperature
on the volume of a gas?
In 1848, Lord Kelvin realized that a temperature of -273.15°C is considered as
absolute zero. Absolute zero is theoretically the lowest attainable temperature. Then he
set up an absolute temperature scale, or the Kelvin temperature scale, with absolute
zero as the starting point on the Kelvin scale.
The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is closely related to the Kelvin
temperature. The volume of a gas and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional to
each other. For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature causes the volume of a gas
to double, and reducing the Kelvin temperature by half causes the volume of a gas to
decrease by half. This relationship between Kelvin temperature and the volume of a
gas is known as Charles’ law.
Charles’ law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure
varies directly with the Kelvin temperature.

The value of 7 is the Kelvin temperature, and / is a constant. The value of k depends
only on the quantity of gas and the pressure. The ratio /7 for any set of volume-
temperature values always equals the same &. Charles' law can be applied directly to
volume-temperature problems using the relationship:

where )’, and 7, represent the initial condition; ’, and 7, represent the new

Charles found that the volume of a gas at constant pressure increases linearly with
the temperature of the gas. That is, a plot of the volume of a gas versus its
temperature (K) gives a straight line assuming the pressure remains constant.
Figure 5.5 illustrates the relationship between the volume of a gas and Kelvin
temperature. If the graph is extrapolated to give zero volume for a gas, the
temperature reached is —273.15°C. This temperature is the lowest temperature
attained by a gas and it is called absolute zero.

3. The Combined Gas Law
A sample of a gas often undergoes changes in temperature, pressure, and volume.
When this happens, the three variables must be dealt with at the same time.
Boyle’s law and Charles’ law can be combined to give one expression called the
combined gas law. The combined gas law expresses the relationship between
pressure, volume, and temperature of a fixed amount of gas.
Derivation of the combined gas law:
Boyle’s law: V a 1/P
Charles’ law: V a T
Then, ’ a 7/P (combined)

@& cHemistaveraDES
The relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro’s law states that equal volumes of different
gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same
number of molecules. Thus, according to the law the volume of a gas is proportional
to the number of molecules (moles) of the gas at STP.

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys the gas laws. Real gases only obey the
ideal gas laws closely at high temperature and low pressure. Under these conditions,
their particles are very far apart. The ideal gas law is a combination of Boyle’s law,
Charles’ law and Avogadro’s law.
We have considered the three laws that describe the behavior of gases as revealed by
experimental observations:
Boyle's law: V @ (at constant T and n)
Charles' law: V a T (at constant P and n)
Avogadro's law: V a n (at constant P and T)
This relationship indicates how the volume of gas depends on pressure, temperature
and number of moles.

Activity 5.13
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. Present your discussion to the class.
Explain why a helium-filled balloon deflated over time faster than an air-filled balloon does.
(Hint: A balloon has many invisible pinholes).
We have seen that a gas tends to expand and occupy any space available to it. This
spreading of gas molecules is called diffusion.
How do you compare the rate of diffusion of molecules with different
densities?
Thomas Graham (1805 - 1869), an English chemist, studied the rate of diffusion of
different gases. He found that gases having low densities diffuse faster than gases with
high densities. He was able to describe quantitatively the relationship between the
density of a gas and its rate of diffusion. In 1829, he announced what is known as
Graham's law of diffusion.
Graham’s law of diffusion states that at constant temperature and pressure, the rate
of diffusion of a gas, r, is inversely proportional to the square root of its density,
d, or molar mass, M.
Mathematically it can be expressed as:
1 [1 .

Discuss the following activities in your group and present to the class.
1. Why some liquids are volatile and others are not?
2. What is the relationship between altitude and boiling point of a liquid?
You recall that liquids have a definite volume and an indefinite shape. They take the
shape of their containers to the level they fill. On the average, liquids are more dense
than gases, but less dense than solids.
As in a gas, particles in a liquid are in constant motion. However, the particles in a
liquid are closer together than those in a gas. The attractive forces between particles
in a liquid are more effective than between particles in a gas. This attraction between
liquid particles is caused by the intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole forces, London
dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonding).
Liquids are more ordered than gases because of the stronger intermolecular forces
and the lower mobility of liquid particles. Accordingly, liquid particles are not bound
together in fixed positions.
Energy Changes in Liquids
Activity 5.16
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon:
When you take bath with hot water in your bathroom, the water collects on the mirror of
the bathroom.
Present your discussion to the class.
The process by which a liquid changes to a gas is known as vaporization. Evaporation
is the process by which liquid molecules break freely from the liquid surface and enter
the vapor phase. Evaporation is explained in terms of the energy possessed by the
molecules on the surface of the liquid.
— RYSICAL STATES OF MATTER >
In an open container, evaporation continues until all of the liquid enters the vapor
phase. However, liquids in a closed container behave differently. The volume of the
liquid decreases for a period of time, and remains unchanged. In closed containers,
the vapor cannot escape. As the vapor concentration increases, some of the vapor
molecules lose energy and return to the liquid state. When a vapor returns to the
liquid state, it is said to condense. The process is called condensation. Evaporation
and condensation are opposing processes.
Evaporation
Liquid ~ Gas
Condensation
The rate of evaporation of a liquid depends on three factors. These are temperature,
intermolecular forces, and surface area of the liquid.
An increase in temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the molecules and
this increases the tendency to change into the gaseous state. Some liquids evaporate
readily at room temperature. Such liquids are said to be volatile. The volatile liquids
have relatively weak forces of attraction between particles. Diethyl ether, ethyl alcohol,
benzene and acetone are volatile liquids.
Non-volatile liquids have a little tendency to evaporate at a given temperature. They
have relatively stronger attractive forces between their molecules, e.g., sulphuric acid,
water, and molten ionic compounds.
Vapour pressure: The partial pressure of the vapour above a liquid is called vapour
pressure. The vapour pressure of a liquid depends up on the temperature. At a given
temperature, vapour pressure is constant. As the temperature increases, the vapour
pressure of a liquid also increases due to high rate of evaporation.
Vapour pressure depends also on the strength of the intermolecular forces between
the particles of the liquid. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the lower the vapour
pressure will be, because fewer particles will have enough kinetic energy to overcome
the attractive force at a given temperature. For example, water and alcohol have
relatively low vapour pressure. On the contrary, liquids with low intermolecular forces
have high vapour pressures at room temperature. For example, diethyl ether, a non-
polar molecule with relatively weak dispersion forces, has a relatively higher vapour
pressure.

Boiling and Boiling Point
Activity 5.17
Form a group and discuss the following ideas. Present your discussion to the class.
1. How does the kinetic-molecular theory explain why atmospheric pressure is greater at
lower altitude than at a higher altitude?
2. Ice melts normally at 0°C. What happens to the melting point of ice in the presence of
impurities? Does it melt below 0°C, above 0°C or exactly at 0°C? Explain.
What is the difference between evaporation and boiling? How does boiling
point depend on the external pressure?
Boiling is the change of a liquid to bubbles of vapour that appear throughout the
liquids. It is the conversion of liquid to vapour within the liquid as well as at its
surface. It occurs when the equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals the
atmospheric pressure. During evaporation only molecules at the surface escape into
the vapour phase, but at the boiling point the molecules within the liquid have sufficient
energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces of their neighbors, so bubbles
of vapour are released at the surface. It is the formation of vapour bubbles within the
liquid itself that characterizes boiling and distinguishes it from evaporation.
If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the equilibrium vapour pressure also
increases. Finally, the boiling point is reached. The boiling point of a liquid is the
temperature at which the equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals the
atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the
boiling point will be.
The boiling point of a liquid can be reduced as lowering the external pressure,
because the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure at a lower
temperature.
If the external pressure is 1.0 atmosphere (760 mmHg), the boiling point is called
normal boiling point. For instance water boils, at 100°C at 1.0 atmospheric pressure.
Thus, the normal boiling point of water is 100°C.
Where will water boil first? In Addis Ababa or Hawassa? Why?

Boiling of a liquid requires a certain amount of heat energy to break the forces of
attraction that holds the molecules together. The amount of heat energy necessary to
bring about the vaporization of a fixed amount of a liquid at a fixed temperature to the
gaseous state is called the heat of vaporization. For example, the heat of vaporization
per mole of water at 298 K and 1 atmosphere is 44.0 kJ. This is called the molar
heat of vaporization (AM, a») of water.
Molar heat of vaporization (AMZ...) and molar heat of condensation (A//,ong) are

Whena solid is continuously heated its ordered crystalline structure is disturbed. The
particles attain their freedom of motion gradually and melting (or fusion) takes place
where the solid is converted into the liquid state. The temperature at which a
crystalline solid is converted to a liquid is known as the melting point.
In contrast when a liquid is cooled, the molecules become closer and closer, and the
intermolecular forces of attraction become stronger and stronger. The particles arrange
themselves into a regular pattern in the liquid. This process is called freezing or
solidification. Note that the freezing point of a liquid is the same as the melting point of
a crystalline solid. This means that:
¢ Both melting and freezing take place at the same temperature.
¢ Both liquid and solid phases coexist at equilibrium with each other at the melting
or freezing point.
To clarify this, let us consider ice, which melts at 0°C and water freezes at 0°C. Ice
and water coexist in equilibrium with each other at 0°C as follows.
melting ,O°C
Ice Liquid water
freezing ,0°C
The amount of heat needed to convert one gram of a solid to a liquid at the melting
point is called heat of fusion. The molar heat of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion
(AH,.) is the quantity of heat needed to convert one mole of a solid at its melting
point to the liquid state. For example, the molar heat of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ at
0°C. This is the amount of energy needed to break the attractive forces in the solid at
the melting point. Melting requires the supply of energy; therefore, it is an endothermic
process.
During the process of solidification, an amount of heat equal to the heat of fusion must
be liberated. This quantity of heat liberated, which is exactly equal to the heat of
fusion, is called the heat of solidification or heat of crystallization.
The molar heat of crystallization (AM a yst) is the quantity of energy that must be
removed from one mole of a liquid to convert it to the solid state at its freezing point.

Although the motion of the particles in a solid are more restricted than those in a

Phase Changes and Energy Changes in Solids
A phase is any part of a system that has uniform composition and properties. A state
of matter represents a phase. Most solid substances undergo two changes of state
when heated. A solid change to a liquid at the melting point, and the liquid changes to
vapour at the boiling point. To understand state changes, we will consider the heating
curve for a substance given in Figure 5.10.
A heating curve is a plot of temperature verses the uniform addition of heat. This can
be illustrated for a hypothetical substance, in which the temperature of the substance is
on the vertical axis and the passage of time during which heat is added to the
substance is on the horizontal axis. Figure 5.10 shows the changes in the temperature
and phases of a pure substance as it is heated, beginning with a solid and continuing
to the gaseous state as described.

solid is converted to a liquid (point C). The added heat energy is used to break the
intermolecular forces, thus disrupting the solid structure. At point C phase change is
completed. Once melting is completed, heating of the liquid raises its temperature
(C to D) until the boiling point is reached at point D. In region (D to E) the addition
of heat is utilized to break the intermolecular forces of the liquid to change it to a gas.
When all the liquid has been converted into a gas, addition of heat simply raises the
temperature of the gas.

PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
¢ Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.
¢ Matter exists in the form of a solid, a liquid or a gas.
¢ Solids have a definite volume and a definite shape.
¢ A liquid has no definite shape, it takes the shape of its container.
¢ A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape.
¢ Gases and liquids are fluids where as solids are not. Fluidity is the tendency
to flow.
¢ When energy is supplied to a solid, it melts and changes to a liquid, the
particles move faster. Additional energy will make the liquid boil and form
a gas.
¢ In the gas the particles are much more widely spaced and move much
faster than in liquid and solid.
e Some solids directly change to gases by the process of sublimation.

Historical Notes
Friedrich Wohler
In 1828 German chemist, Friedrich Wohler converted
ammonium cyanate, an inorganic compound, into the organic
substance urea. Wohler’s discovery revolutionized the study of
chemistry by redefining the manner in which chemists
distinguished between inorganic and organic compounds. He is
also credited for his work in isolating the elements aluminium
Friedrich Wohler
and beryllium.
Activit1.y1
1. Do you agree with the notion that says:“carbon compounds can be synthesized only by
animals and plants’?
2. Draw diagramtso show how carbon atomscan link to one another in different waytso
form a variety of compounds by considering only four carbon atoms.
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
History of Organic Chemistry
Before the beginning of the nineteenth century, chemists classified compounds into two
classes; organic and inorganic. Those derived from living things (plants and animals) were
classified as organic compounds, while those that came from mineral constituents of the
earth or were found with non-living things are classified as inorganic compounds.
What was the basis of this classification? Early chemists believed that organic compounds
differed from inorganic compounds because living things had a special ‘life force’ within
them, which was invisible and hard to detect. According to the theory of ‘life force’, the
only source of organic compounds was nature itself (plants and animals). It was thought
impossible to synthesize them in the laboratory. This was because man could not add or
create the ‘life force’ within them.
The belief in the ‘life force’ theory continued until Friedrich Wohler synthesized urea for
the first time in 1828. In attempting to prepare ammonium cyanate, NH,CNO, from the
reaction of silver cyanate, AgCNO, and ammonium chloride, NH_CI, he accidentally
and surprisingly obtained urea, (NH,),CO:
AgCNO(aq) + NH,Cl(aq) — AgCl(s) + NH,CNO(aq)
O
|
NH,CNO (aq) "> HN — C — HN (s)
Urea
Urea was the first organic compound synthesized in the laboratory. The synthesis of
urea by Friedrich Wohler and subsequent synthesis of other organic compounds marked
the downfall of the ‘life force’ theory.
How do you explain organic compounds at present and define organic chemistry?
The common feature of organic compounds is that they all contain the element carbon. Organic
compounds are the compounds of carbon found in and derived from plants and animals.
They also include those substances synthesized in laboratories except the oxides of carbon,
carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, cyanides and cyanates.
Besides carbon, these compounds contain a few other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus. The branch of chemistry that studies carbon
compounds is called organic chemistry. This branch of chemistry was developed, starting
from the theory of ‘life force’ to the era in which synthetic organic compounds are used in
our daily lives. The number of inorganic compounds discovered and prepared may be in the
region of some hundred thousand. At present, millions of organic compounds have been
discovered, synthesized, and used.
— @— Gtewsteverve10
The main reason for the presence of millions of carbon compounds is the unique property
of carbon called catenation. Catenation is the ability of atoms of the same element to join
together forming short or long chains and rings. A few other elements like sulphur, silicon
and boron show this behaviour, but to a much lesser extent.
Classification of Organic Compounds
Activity 1.2
CH,CH,CHO and CH,COCH, have the same chemical formula C,H,O. Write their detailed
structures and observe their difference? Why do these compounds have different
properties? Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
Organic compounds are generally classified based on their functional group.
What are functional groups and what groups of organic compounds are known
on the basis of this classification?
The functional group is the part of amolecule or a compound that determines the chemical
properties of that molecule or compound. This group also determines some of the physical
properties of a compound. Based on the functional groups they possess, the most common
classification of organic compounds including alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, alcohols,
aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. The common functional groups of some
organic compounds are given in Table 1.1.

2. Consider three organic compounds containing two carbon atoms each. The two carbon
atoms contributed one electron each in the first, two electrons each in the second and
three electrons each in the third for the bond they form between them by sharing the
electrons. The remaining valence electrons of each carbon atom in all the three
compounds were used to form bonds with hydrogen atoms.

d If the three compounds mentioned above are hydrocarbons, define
hydrocarbons?
f If the first compound is a saturated hydrocarbon, the second and the third are
unsaturated, what is the basis for such a classification of hydrocarbons?
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
What are hydrocarbons and on what basis do we categorize them?
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of the elements carbon and hydrogen
only. Hydrocarbons are subdivided into two groups, based on the type of bonding between
carbon atoms, as saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Saturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen containing only
carbon-carbon single bonds. Methane, ethane, and propane are typical examples of this
group. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen possessing
one or more multiple bonds (double or triple bonds) between carbon atoms. Alkenes,
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons are examples of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
A formula that shows all the bonds and atoms is called a detailed structure. The shorter
Structure is called condensed structure.

Activity 1.4
Draw a graph using the information in Table 1.2 by plotting the number of carbon atoms
of each compound on one axis, and hydrogen atoms on the other. Predict the formulas of
the saturated hydrocarbons containing 8,9 and 10 carbon atoms and complete Table 1.2.
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. They contain chains of carbon atoms linked by single
bonds only. Every carbon atom in the molecule forms four single covalent bonds with other
atoms. Alkanes have the general formula CH,,,,where, n= 1, 2,3... Using this general
formula, we can write the molecular formula of any alkane containing a specific number of
carbon atoms. For example, the chemical formulas of alkanes containing one, two and three
carbon atoms are C_H,.,,=CH,, C,H =C,H,, and C,H =C.,H,, respectively.
172x142 20° 2x2+2 2° 6? 3° 2x3 +2 3° 8?
When we compare the formulas of CH, and C,H, or C,H, and C,H,, they differ by one
carbon and two hydrogen atoms or—CH,— group called the methylene group. A group of
compounds in which each member of the group differs from the next member by a—CH,,,
is called a homologous series. Compounds in the same homologous series can be represented
by the same general formula. The individual members of the group are called homologues.
Alkanes contain carbon-carbon single bonds (— C — C —) as their functional group.

1. What happentso the percentage by mass of hydrogen and the physical state of alkanes
as the number of carbon atoms increase?
2. Categorize the petroleum related products you encounter everyday as solids, liquids
and gases? Discuss in your group and present it to the class.
Doyou know which alkanes exist in the liquid, solid or gaseous state at room temperature?
What types of intermolecularforces ofattraction exist between the molecules ofalkanes?
Explain why the boiling points and melting points of alkanes increase with increasing
number of carbon atoms.
Atroom temperature, the first four alkanes, methane to butane, are gases; whereas pentane
(C.H,,) to heptadecane (C,_H,,) are liquids, and the alkanes containing eighteen and
more carbon atoms are solids.
Alkanes are nonpolar organic compounds. Weak intermolecular forces called Van der
Waal’s forces hold their molecules together. The strength of these forces increases with the
— @— Giawstvormve10
increasing surface area (molecular mass) of the alkanes. Since alkanes are non-polar,
they are almost insoluble in polar solvents like water, but, they are soluble in non-polar
solvents like benzene, toluene, ether and carbon tetrachloride.
The density, melting point, and boiling point of the homologous series of alkanes increase
as the carbon number increases. For alkanes of the same carbon number, branched-chain
isomers have lower boiling points than the straight-chain (normal) alkanes. The reason is,
as branching increases, there is a decrease in surface area and the strength of the
intermolecular force, which, in turn, results in a decrease in boiling point; e.g., the boiling
points of n-pentane, iso-pentane and neo-pentane are 36°C, 28°C and 9.5°C, respectively.
Alkanes containing all the carbon atoms in one continuous chain are called normal or
straight-chain alkanes and those containing chains with branches are known as branched-
chain alkanes.
Example
In alkanes (branched or straight-chain) each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to
four atoms with a bond angle of 109.5°.
a Balland Stick Model of Methane — b Tetrahedral structure of methane
Figure 1.1 Structure of methane.
In alkanes containing a continuous chain of carbon atoms, the carbon atoms are not linked
in straight line but in zigzag chains to keep the tetrahedral distribution of atoms.

1. Why rules are important for naming organic compounds? Discuss in your group some
of the rules you know for naming organic compounds and present it to your class.
2. In mathematics, the names pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon are used to
describe polygons. What does each of the prefixes- pent, -hex, -hept and -oct indicate?
What is the significance of these prefixes in chemistry? Discuss in groups and present
it to the class.
Organic chemistry uses a simplified and systematic way of naming organic compounds. The
names of alkanes and most of the organic compounds are derived from:
i) aprefix- indicating the number of carbon atoms (listed in Table 1.3)and
ii) a-suffix indicating the type of the functional group present in the molecule.
The following table introduces the prefixes that are used to indicate the presence of one to
ten carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain.
Table 1.3 Prefixes commonly used to indicate one to ten carbon atoms.
Meth- One Hex- ax
Eh- Two Hept- Seven
Prop- Three Oct- Eight
But- Four Non- Nine
Pent- Five Dec- Ten
From Table 1.2, you can note that the names of all alkanes contain the suffix ‘-ane’, which
indicates that their functional group is a carbon — carbon single bond. Thus, to name an
alkane, you should use the appropriate prefix that indicates the number of carbon atoms and
the suffix ‘-ane’. For example, to name the alkane C,H, ,, use the prefix “Hex’ that indicate
the presence of six carbon atoms and add the suffix °-ane’ so that the name becomes hexane.
Activity 1.7
Practice naming alkanes using first four prefixes mentioned in Table 1.3.ln naming alkanes,
why are number of carbon atoms used as prefixes? Discuss in groups.
Common Names of Alkanes
Lower members of the alkane homologous series have common names. The prefixes used
in the common names are n- (normal), “iso-’ and ‘neo-’. The prefix - is used when all the
carbon atoms form a continuous chain.
Example
H,C — CH, — CH, —CH, — CH,
n-pentane
H,C — CH, — CH, —CH, — CH, —CH,
n-hexane
Iso- is used when all of the carbon atoms form a continuous chain, except for the one

IUPAC System of Nomenclature of Alkanes
It is difficult to have common names for the more branched and complex alkanes. In
naming such alkanes, the more systematic, convenient and appropriate one is the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system. In order to apply
this system, it is very important to know the rules to be followed, what alkyl radicals are,
and how they are named.
Alkyl radicals are obtained by removing one hydrogen atom from the corresponding
alkanes. Their general formula is C,H,,,,,, where n= 1, 2,3 .... The names of alkyl
radicals are derived from the names of the corresponding parent alkanes by changing the
suffix -ane to -yl.

The system of naming organic compounds is based on the recommendations of IUPAC.
The following are the rules established by IUPAC to name branched-chain hydrocarbons.
@ cHemisteverADEID
1. Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule as the parent
structure. The name of the straight-chain alkane possessing the same number of
carbon atoms is used as the name of this longest chain. The groups attached to the
parent structure are called side chains or substituents.
Example 1

Side chain a
There are seven carbon atoms in the longest chain (the parent structure). Therefore, it
gets the name “heptane”.
2. Assign numbers to the carbon atoms of the longest chain starting from one end to
the other so that the carbon atoms to which side chains are attached get the lowest
possible number.
CH,— CH,
CH,—CH, oH —‘CH —CH, —CH, —CH,
CH,
or
CH,— CH,
CH,—CH, oH —‘CH — CH, —CH— C,H,
CH,
To check which direction of numbering is correct; add the locants (numbers assigned
to the carbon atoms to which substituents are attached).
The sum of locants in the first case is 3 + 4=7 and in the second case, 4+ 5 =9.
So numbering should be done from left to right in this case. Thus, the first option is
correct.
3. Indicate the position of the side chain by using the number assigned to the carbon
atom to which it is attached. If the same substituents appear more than once, use the
© INTRODUCTIONTO ORBANICCHEMISTEY (UNIT1)
prefix di-, tri-, tetra- etc. before the name of the substituent to show two, three,
four, etc. substituents, respectively.
4. Numbers are separated from each other by commas while they are separated from
substituent names by hyphens.
5. Arrange the names of the side chains before the parent name in alphabetical order.
The complete name of the alkane given in the above example will then be 4-ethyl-3-
methylheptane (substituents in alphabetical order).
Example 2

The longest chain has six carbon atoms and the parent name is hexane. There are two
methyl groups at carbon-2 and another two methyl groups on carbon-4 and one chlorine
atom at carbon-3. Therefore, the correct name of the compound ts 3-chloro-2,2,4,4-
tetramethylhexane.
Example 3

The longest chain contains eight carbon atoms. Hence, the parent name of the given molecule
is octane. There are three methyl groups attached to carbon number 3, 4 and 6; one
bromine atom is attached to carbon-4 and two chlorine atoms are attached to carbon-3
and carbon-5. Thus, the correct name of the compound is 4-bromo-3,5-dichloro-3,4,6-
trimethyloctane.
~ CHEMISTRY GRAD1E0
Note:
When F, Cl, Br and I appear as substituents, change the names fluorine, chlorine, bromine
and iodine to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo, respectively.

There are seven carbon atoms in the parent structure, so it takes the name heptane. There
are two methyl groups at carbon-2 and two methyl groups at carbon-4 and carbon-5 and

There is only one possible structure for each of the first three alkanes, namely, methane
(CH,), ethane (C,H,) and propane (C,H,). Those alkanes containing four or more carbon
atoms have more than one structure. The existence of two or more chemical compounds
with the same molecular formula but different structures is called isomerism.
The compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures are
called isomers. Alkanes exhibit a type of structural isomerism called chain or skeletal
isomerism. These structures differ in the arrangement of the carbon atoms and hydrogen
atoms. To understand what isomers are, consider the isomers of butane (C,H,,) and
pentane (C.H,,).
1. Isomers of butane (C,H,,)
Butane has two isomers:
2. Isomers of pentane (C.H,,)
Pentane has three isomers.
Alkanes are the major constituents of petroleum and natural gas. They are mainly obtained
by fractional distillation of petroleum. Alkanes can also be prepared in the laboratory.

b If adomestic heating system is fuelled by methane, what difference does it make
if the combustion produces CO, or CO?
Alkanes are generally not considered to be very reactive organic compounds. The name
paraffin for alkanes arose from two Latin words ‘parum’ meaning /itt/e and ‘affinis’ means
affinity. Thus, paraffin means little affinity. This name was suggested because alkanes are
inert towards many reagents like acids, bases, oxidizing and reducing agents. However,
they undergo several reactions under suitable conditions.
The major reactions of alkanes are the following:
1. Combustion Reactions: Ifalkanes are burned with limited supply of oxygen,
they will form water and carbon monoxide and will liberate lesser amounts of heat
energy. Alkanes burn in excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, liberating
a greater amounts of heat. The general equation for the reaction is:
CH.» + ( 3nt+1Jo, + nCO, + (n+1)H,O + heat
n~ 2n+2 2
where n is the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule.
Example
C,H, + 50, > 3CO, + 4H,O + 2299kJ
The heat energy liberated is used to generate electricity, to move motor vehicles or
to cook our food.

1. Write the general equation for the combustion of alkanes in a limited supply of oxygen
that forms carbon monoxide, water and energy.
2. Why is apetroleum refinery is built in the open air? Present your opinion to the class.
2. Substitution Reaction: This is a reaction that involves the replacement of one
atom or a group of atoms by another atom or group of atoms. Halogenation of
alkanes is avery good example of substitution reaction. This reaction involves
reacting alkanes with chlorine and bromine. The reaction of chlorine and bromine
with alkanes proceeds in presence of heat or sunlight. This type of reaction is
called photochemical reaction. The reaction of alkanes with chlorine and bromine
proceeds in a sequence of steps. For example, let us consider the photochemical
reaction of methane with chlorine (chlorination):
i) Chain Initiating Step: This step involves absorption of energy to generate
reactive particles known as free radicals. A free radical is an atom or a
group of atoms possessing unpaired electron. A free radical is electrically neutral.
A chlorine molecule absorbs light and decomposes into two chlorine atoms:
ci_cy 8th 2c.
ii) Chain Propagating Step: This is astep which consumes a reactive particle (free
radical) produced in the chain initiation step and generates another free radical.
Cl + CH, —> HCl + CH;
iii) Chain Terminating Step: In the chain terminating step reactive particles (free
radicals) are consumed but not generated.
CH,> + Cle —~> CHCl
In this step, “side reactions’ that do not lead to the formation of the desired products
often take place.
Examples
Cl + Clk —> Cl,
CH, + CH, —> CH,—CH,
Such a detailed step by step description of a chemical reaction is called a reaction
mechanism.

from a compound and leads to the formation of a compound containing a multiple
bond (unsaturated compound). It can also involve the removal of hydrogen atoms
from adjacent carbon atoms at relatively high temperatures.

Physical Properties of Alkenes
1. Why some alkenes exist in gaseous and liquid states at room temperature?
2. The melting points, boiling points and densities of alkenes increase with increasing
number of carbon atoms; why?
3. Are alkenes coloured compounds? Do they have smell?
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
At room temperature, alkenes containing two to four carbon atoms are gases. Those
containing five to seventeen carbon atoms are liquids, and those containing eighteen or
more carbon atoms are solids.
Alkenes are non-polar. Therefore, their molecules are held together by weak inter-molecular
forces. Since they are non-polar, they are almost insoluble in polar solvents like water, but
soluble in non-polar solvents like ether, benzene, toluene and carbon tetrachloride.
Nomenclature of Alkenes
Alkenes can have common names as well as IUPAC names. The common names of alkenes
are obtained by using the prefixes in Table 1.3 and adding the suffix ‘-ylene’:

The IUPAC names of alkenes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3 to
indicate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and adding the suffix ‘-ene’. The
suffix ‘-ene’ indicates the presence of a double bond. For example, the alkene having the
formula C,H, is named as octene. The prefix oct- indicates that there are eight carbon
atoms in the molecule and ‘-ene’ signifies the presence of a double bond.
In the IUPAC system of naming alkenes, the rules we follow are similar to those rules we
follow for naming alkanes with slight modifications. These are:
1. Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule that includes the
double bond as a parent structure. Its name will be the same as the alkene containing
the same number of carbon atoms.
Activity 1.17

2. Number the carbon atoms starting from one end to the other in such a way that the
carbon atom preceding the double bond takes the lowest possible number and
indicate the position of the double bond by this number in the name.

The longest chain contains 7 carbon atoms and a double bond between the 2nd

group at carbon number 3. Therefore, the complete name of the compound 1s:
6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyl-3-octene, or
6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyloct-3-ene.

TIsomerism in Alkenes
Alkenes containing two and three carbon atoms have only one possible structure. Alkenes
containing four or more carbon atoms exhibit isomerism. Alkenes show the following three
types of isomerism:
1. Chain isomerism: This is due to the difference in the arrangement of the carbon
atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain.
Position isomerism: This is due to the difference in the position of the double bond
in the carbon chain.
Example
Consider the following compounds with the same molecular formula (C.H,,):
— @—Giawstvormve10
Compounds (a) and (b) represent the position isomers of pentene, (c) and (d) are
position isomers of methylbutene, (a), (c) and (e) are the chain isomers, while all
these compounds are the isomers of C,H...
3. Geometrical isomerism. This results from the difference in the relative spatial
arrangement of atoms or groups about the double bond. This isomerism exists because
free rotation about the double bond is not possible. To differentiate geometrical
isomers, we use the prefix ‘cis’ if two similar groups are on the same side of the
double bond and ‘trans’ when the two similar groups are on opposite sides of it;
‘cis’ means the same and ‘trans’ means across.
The geometrical isomers of 2-pentene are:

Preparation of Alkenes
Do you know the major source of alkenes and the process that leads to their formation?
Alkenes are mainly obtained during fractional distillation of petroleum when the process
called cracking is carried out.
In the laboratory, alkenes can be prepared by:
1. Dehydration of alcohols with concentrated sulphuric acid or alumina (AIO,).
Dehydration means removal of water.
General Reaction:

Chemical properties of Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing double bond (a strong bond and a weak
bond) between the two carbon atoms. They are more reactive than alkanes, because the
weak bond can be used for further reaction. They undergo several types of reactions.
1. Combustion reaction. Alkenes burn in oxygen with a luminous flame to form carbon
dioxide and water.
General reaction: C,H, + (3=n) O, — nCO, + nH,O + heat
Example
C,H,(g) + 60,(g) — 4CO,(g) + 4H,O(g) + heat
2. Addition reaction. Alkenes undergo mainly addition reactions. The addition occurs
at the carbon-carbon double bond.
a Addition of halogens (halogenation): When a halogen molecule, X,, (where,
X, = Cl, or Br,) is added to alkenes, the product is a dihaloalkane.
General reaction:
37
Example
If bromine water (bromine in CCL) is added to alkenes, the reddish brown
colour of Br, in CCL, will disappear. This is due to the addition of bromine
(Br,) across the double bond. So, Br, in CCl, is used to detect unsaturation
(presence of multiple bond) in a compound.
b Addition of hydrogen (Hydrogenation): Addition of hydrogen molecule to
alkenes in the presence of a nickel or platinum catalyst yields alkanes.
General reaction: R-CH =CH,+H, —*>R-CH, —CH,
Alkene Alkane
Example
__ Pt

Ethene Ethane
c Addition of hydrogen halides, HX (hydrohalogenation): Addition ofhydrogen
halide (HCI, HBr or HI) to alkenes leads to the formation of alkyl halides. The
product of the reaction can be predicted by Markovnikov’s rule; which states
that “when an alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide to give an alkyl halide, the
hydrogen adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that has the greater number
of hydrogen atoms, and the halogen to the carbon that has the fewer number of
hydrogen atoms”.
The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form
an alcohol.

Alkaline KMnO, solution is also used as a qualitative test for the identification of
unsaturation in a compound. The solution is called Baeyer’s reagent. In the
presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the purple colour of alkaline KMnO,
solution fades and a brown precipitate is formed.
f Polymerization (self-addition) of alkenes: Polymerization is the union of small
molecules called monomers to form a large molecule called a polymer.

Uses of Ethene (Ethylene)
Ethene is used in the production of ethanol, and polymers such as polyethene,
polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene and teflon. It is also used in the production
of 1,2-ethanediol, which is used as an antifreeze material; and for the preservation
as well as artificial ripening of fruits.

second basket put only green tomatoes (but not a banana). Compare the tomatoes in the
two baskets. Do the tomatoes ripen at the same rate in both baskets; if not, why? Share
your opinion with your classmates.
Cycloalkenes
Cycloalkenes are unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons. The carbon atoms are linked in sucha
manner as to form a closed chain or a ring structure. They contain a double bond between
carbon atoms and are represented by the general formula CH,_,, where n should be
equal to or greater than 3. They are isomeric with alkynes. They are named by prefixing
“cyclo” to the name of alkenes containing the same number of carbon atoms. The given
structures show some examples of cycloalkenes.
The IUPAC names for alkynes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3. The
suffix “-yne’ is added to the prefixes, which indicates the presence of a triple bond between a
pair of adjacent carbon atoms. Alkynes are named in the same way as alkenes.

Chemical Properties of Alkynes
Alkynes are more reactive than alkanes and alkenes. Why?
Alkynes are more unsaturated than alkanes and alkenes due to the presence of a carbon-
carbon triple bond. They can undergo combustion and addition reactions.
Some of the common reactions of alkynes are:
1. Combustion reaction: Alkynes burn with a smoky luminous flame, forming CO, and
water. Smoky luminous flames result from the combustion of alkynes due to their high
carbon content.

Acetylene is a colourless, sweet-smelling gas in pure form and is insoluble in water. It is
usually stored as a solution of acetone in steel cylinders. Combustion of acetylene with
oxygen produces an intensely hot flame of about 3000°C. Thus, a large quantity of acetylene
is used as a fuel in oxy-acetylene torches for cutting and welding metals. Acetylene is also
used to prepare acrylonitrile which is a starting material for producing polyacrylonitrile, a
raw material for textile fibre. It is also used for making vinyl] chloride which polymerizes to

Activity 1.24
Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1. What comes to your mind when you hear the word “benzene”?
2. What is the word “aroma” mean? Which substances have an aroma smell?
3. Are aromatic hydrocarbons unsaturated as alkenes? Why?
The term aromatic is derived from the word ‘aroma’ meaning pleasant smell, which was
originally used to describe naturally occurring compounds with pleasant smells. At present,
the term is used without its original significance. Aromatic hydrocarbons are generally
obtained from petroleum and coal tar. They are a group of hydrocarbons characterized by
the presence of a benzene ring or related structures. Some examples of aromatic
hydrocarbon structures are given below:

Benzene is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon. Its molecular formula is C,H,. FriedricAh.
Kekule, in 1865, suggested that the six carbon atoms of benzene are arranged in the shape
of ahexagon. He also suggested a resonance hybrid structure. He represented benzene by
the resonance structures (Figure 1.10) in which the two structures shown make equal
contribution for the resonance hybrid or actual structure.

The bonds in benzene are neither single nor double but have an intermediate character
between those of single and double bonds. All the carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule
are same in length and nature. Since structure I or II grven above are not the true structures
of the benzene molecule, the benzene ring is written, in most cases, in its resonance hybrid
form as follows:
mux?
3 — &-O
The six electrons in the hexagonal ring are delocalized.
From structures I and IT in Figure 1.10, one may think that benzene has three double
bonds and has the same chemistry as that of alkenes. But, this is not true. Benzene and
other aromatic hydrocarbons are not as unsaturated as alkenes because the three double
bonds in benzene are delocalized due to resonance. They are more stable than alkenes.
They undergo substitution reactions to a far greater extent than addition reactions, which is
a different characteristic compared to alkenes.
Physical Properties of Benzene
Benzene is a flammable, colourless, and volatile liquid with a characteristic smell. It is
nonpolar and immiscible with water but miscible with non-polar solvents like ether and
carbon tetrachloride. It freezes at 5.4°C and boils at 80.4°C. It is a carcinogenic (cancer
causing) substance. Benzene is a good solvent for fats, gums, rubber etc., and is used in
the manufacture of dyes, drugs and explosives.
Chemical Properties of Benzene
Benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons are more stable than alkenes and alkynes due to
the stability of the aromatic ring. It neither decolorizes bromine water (Br, in CCL) nor is
reactive towards cold potassium permanganate solution. However, benzene undergoes
the following reactions:
1. Combustion reaction: Benzene 1s highly inflammable. It burns with a smoky luminous
flame to form CO, and H,O.
2C,H, + 150, — 12CO, + 6H,O + Heat
2. Substitution reaction: The reactions of benzene are chiefly substitution but not
addition reactions. In this reaction, hydrogen atom from the benzene ring is replaced
by another atom or group.
a Halogenation: Benzene reacts with bromine and chlorine in the presence of
iron (IIT) chloride or aluminium chloride catalyst to form substitution products.

Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1. What do you think is the major component of natural gas?
2. How can petroleum be separated into different fractions?
3. How are natural gas, petroleum and coal formed in nature? Can they be recycled?
A. Natural Gas
The principal sources of hydrocarbons are natural gas, crude oil and coal. Natural gas is
found in association with petroleum or alone. It is found in underground deposits several
hundreds or thousands ofmetres below the earth’s surface, where it originated from the decay
and decomposition of animal and plant remains millions of years ago. Natural gas mainly
contains methane (more than 90%), ethane, propane, butane and small quantities of higher
alkanes. Other gases such as, CO,, N,, O, and H,S, may also be present in natural gas.
The composition of natural gas varies, depending on its place of origin. Natural gas is
widely used as a fuel. It is advantageous over liquid and solid fuels and also other gases,
except H., due to its very high heat of combustion.
B. Petroleum
The word petroleum is derived from two Latin words, ‘petra’ meaning rock, and ‘oleum’
meaning oil. Thus, petroleum means rock oil. The term petroleum refers to a broad range
of fossil hydrocarbons that are found as gases, liquids or solids beneath the surface of the
earth. The crude oil is generally found along with natural gas in the form of a dark-
coloured viscous liquid, which is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Its composition
varies according to its place of origin. However, crude oil mainly contains alkanes,
cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It also contains organic compounds consisting
of nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen in small amounts.
Refining of Crude Oil
Crude oil or petroleum is obtained by drilling wells until the oil-bearing region is reached.
After the crude oil is brought to the surface of the earth, it must be refined before it
can be used.
Crude oil is refined or separated into several components by fractional distillation based
on the differences in boiling ranges of its fractions. (Figure 1.11).

Most hydrocarbons present in petroleum are long-chain hydrocarbons. However, there is
avery high demand for petrol or gasoline, which contains hydrocarbons, composed of five
to ten carbon atoms. Therefore, the amount of petrol obtained by fractional distillation of
crude oil does not satisfy the demand for it. To satisfy the demand and maximize the output
of petrol or gasoline, the process called cracking is carried out during fractional distillation.
What does cracking mean? Cracking is the decomposition of large hydrocarbon molecules
into smaller ones by the application of heat (thermal cracking or pyrolysis) or in the
presence of catalysts (catalytic cracking).

Coal is formed naturally by the decomposition of plant matter over several millions of
years. It is not a pure form of carbon. It is an important source of aromatic hydrocarbons.
Heating mineral coal in the absence of air, or oxygen is called destructive distillation of coal
or coking of coal. When coal is heated in the absence of air it gives volatile products and
coke. The volatile products separate into coal gas and a liquid, called coal tar when cooled.
Aromatic hydrocarbons and many other substances are isolated from coal tar by fractional
distillation.
Coke, which is a solid and relatively pure form of carbon, is used as a fuel in the blast
furnace during the extraction of iron. It is also used to produce gaseous fuels, such as
water gas (mixture of H, and CO) and producer gas (mixture of N, and CO).

1. List some alcohols you know? Name the alcohol used in alcoholic beverages? What
are the uses of alcohols in industry?
2. Ethiopia uses an alcohol blended with benzene to drive cars. What is the name of the
alcohol? What is the source of this alcohol?
What do you think when you hear the word “alcohol”? Can you define alcohol? Give a
few examples of the uses of alcohols. Most people think of two common alcohols- the
substance that intoxicates people and the one used in clinics and hospitals. However, there
are many types of alcohol. The only alcohol present in all alcoholic beverages is called
ethanol. Other alcohols are used for different purposes.
Alcohols are hydroxyl derivatives of hydrocarbons that can be obtained by replacing one
or more hydrogen atom(s) ofa hydrocarbon with the hydroxyl (—OH) group. The hydroxyl
group is the functional group of alcohols.

1.6.1 Classification of Alcohols
Alcohols are generally classified as monohydric, dihydric and trihydric depending on the
number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups they contain in their molecular structure.
Monohydric alcohols are alcohols containing only one hydroxyl group.
Examples
CH,—CH,—OH CH,—CH,—CH,—OH
Ethanol 1-propanol
Dihydric alcohols are those containing two hydroxyl groups per molecule. They are also
named glycols or diols.
Example
one
HO OH
Ethane-1,2-diol (Ethylene glycol)
Trihydric alcohols are those containing three hydroxyl groups in their molecular structure.
Polyhydric alcohols are those containing three or more hydroxyl groups in their molecular
structure. Trihydric alcohols are also considered as polyhydric alcohols.
Example
H,C — CH — CH,
|| |
OH OH OH
Propane-1,2,3-triol or Glycerine or glycerol
1.6.2 Nomenclature of Alcohols
An alcohol can be considered to be derived from a hydrocarbon by the replacement of at
least one H atom by hydroxyl group. Hence, alcohols can be systematically named by
using the suffix -o/ to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane name.

In the IUPAC system of nomenclature of alcohols containing side chains or—OH groups in
different positions, the longest chain to which the -OH group is attached, is chosen as a
parent structure. The chain is then numbered, starting from the end closer to the carbon
atom to which the—OH group is bonded. The other rules are similar to the nomenclature of
hydrocarbons.

Due to the hydrogen bonding in alcohols, they have higher melting and boiling points than
hydrocarbons of comparable molecular size (mass). Hydrogen bonding is also the cause
for even lower members to be liquids at room temperature. The boiling point of more
branched isomer is lower than that of its isomeric straight-chain alcohol.

molecular mass = 62), boils at 197°C, while 1-propanol (monohydric, molecular
mass = 60) boils at 97.2°C.
The first three alcohols, methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol are miscible with water in all
proportions, while the solubility in water decreases with increasing carbon number. The

1 How do the local people in Ethiopia prepare alcoholic beverages like “Tella; “Tej” and
“Katikalla’? What raw materials and apparatus do they use?
2 Which industrial method of production of ethanol is more or less similar to the method
followed by the local people? Share your ideas with your class.
Ethanol is the second member of the homologous series of monohydric alcohols. It is one
of the constituents of all alcoholic beverages. ‘Tella’, ‘Tey’, beer, wine, “Katikalla’, ouzo,
gin and whisky contain ethanol. There are anumber of methods for preparing ethanol
using different materials.
Industrial preparation of Ethanol
Ethanol is manufactured industrially by:
1. Fermentation of carbohydrates such as sugar: Fermentation is the slow
decomposition of carbohydrates such as sucrose, starch and cellulose in the presence
of suitable enzyme, that results in the formation of ethanol and carbon dioxide:
C,.H,,0,, + H,O oinveretase C5H,,0, + C.H,0¢
Sucrose Glucose Fructose
C,H,,.0O, ——— 2CH,CH,OH + 2CO,
Glucose Ethanol
Fermentation can produce an alcoholic beverage whose ethanol content is
12—15% only. The alcohol kills the yeast and inhibits its actrvity when the percentage
is higher. To produce beverages of higher ethanol content, distillation of the aqueous
solution is required.
Most liquor factories in Ethiopia use molasses, a by-product of sugar industries, as
araw material to produce ethanol. In the brewing industry, germinated barley called
malt (in Amharic, ‘Bikil’)is used as the starting material. The whole process taking
place in breweries is summarized as follows:

in the presence of phosphoric acid, H,PO,, catalyst.

Properties and Uses of Ethanol
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with a pleasant smell and a burning taste. It boils at 78.3°C and
freezes at—117°C. Itis inflammable and burns with a blue flame. It is miscible with water in all
proportions, non-poisonous and has an intoxicating effect. It is a hypnotic (sleep producer).
Ethanol is a constituent of all alcoholic beverages. It is a good solvent for many organic
compounds that are insoluble in water, such as paints, dyes, perfumes etc. It is also used as
a fuel for cars and spirit lamps, and to make denatured alcohol which is a mixture of
ethanol and other poisonous substance that has been added to make the alcohol unfit for
drinking. For example, methylated spirit is a mixture of 95% ethanol and 5% methanol.
¢ Currently, Ethiopia uses 5% ethanol with 95% benzene as fuel for cars.
Why alcoholic beverages such as “Tela; “Tej* beer and wine turn sour if they are not
properly stored? Which reaction of alcohols is responsible for this phenomenon? Write a
chemical equation to support your answer. Discuss with your group and present it to the
Class.
What types of reactions do alcohols undergo? Alcohols contain a hydrocarbon group and
a functional group (OH). Which part of alcohols is responsible for most of their chemical
reactions?
Reactions of alcohols may involve the cleavage of the oxygen hydrogen bond (— O— H) or
the carbon-oxygen bond (— C — O).
The reactions of alcohols involving the -O-H bond cleavage are:
a Alcohols react with strongly electropositive metals like Na, K and Ca to form
alkoxides and liberating H, gas.

le Oxidation of alcohols: The oxidation products of alcohols depend on the type of
alcohol and the nature of oxidizing agents. Oxidation of alcohols is a very important
method for the production of other oxygen-containing compounds of hydrocarbons,
such as aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.

Note that aldehydes are represented by the general structural formula R — C — H or

use the suffix -a/ to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding
alkane name. The suffix “‘-al” indicates the functional group -CHO. The names
and condensed structures of the first stx aldehydes are given in Table 1.11.

The general structural formula of ketones is: R—C— R’ or RCOR’ where R
and R’ may be same or different. The IUPAC names of ketones are obtained
by using the suffix -one to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane
name. The suffix ‘-one’ indicates the functional group. Unlike aldehydes, the
position of the functional group must be indicated in the name of higher ketones.
To do so, the longest chain containing the functional group is chosen as a parent
structure and then the carbon atoms of the chain are numbered starting from the
end closer to the carbonyl group.

/ INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1) >
Industrial application
Organic chemicals are used for the manufacturing of a large number of industrial products
that have a variety of uses. Some of these products include alcoholic beverages,
pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents etc.
A. Alcoholic beverages
All alcoholic beverages commonly contain the alcohol known as ethanol. The ethanol
content of all alcoholic beverages is not the same. Some beverages contain small
concentrations of ethanol while others contain higher concentrations. These alcoholic
beverages can be either undistilled or distilled. The undistilled alcoholic beverages include
beer, wine, “Tella”, ‘Tey’ etc while ouzo, gin, brandy, whisky, ‘Katikalla’, and vodka are
among the distilled alcoholic beverages.
Beer: Beer is one of the alcoholic beverages widely manufactured and consumed in
most parts of the world. The common raw materials for its production are barley
and hops. Although the types of beer produced in the world are very many, the
average beer has alcohol content between 3-6 percent by volume.
Wine: Wine is another undistilled alcoholic beverage. The most common raw material for
producing wine are grapes. In the production process, grapes are first crushed and
then steamed. The liquid derived from crushing is called must. It then goes to a
fermentation tank where fermentation takes place. Then it passes to a settling tank,
where sediments are allowed to settle, and it proceeds from there to a filter. The
clear liquid is cooled in arefrigerator and is pasteurized as it passes through a flash
pasteurizer. Most wines have an alcohol content varying from 10-15% by volume.
Liquor: Compared with beer and wine, liquor contains higher concentrations of ethanol. It
is not possible to obtain an alcoholic beverage of more than 15% alcohol by volume
through fermentations. This is because the yeast cells are not able to stay alive in
alcohol of higher concentration. To get alcoholic beverages with higher percentages
of alcohol, the alcohol must be separated from the solution by distillation.
The alcoholic beverages like ouzo, gin, cognac, whisky etc, are made by distillation. Different
types of liquors have different alcohol concentrations. In most distilled alcoholic beverages
the percentage ranges between 30-45% alcohol by volume. However, some alcoholic
beverages like Araki are expected to have a higher percentage of ethanol.
B. Pharmaceuticals
Organic chemicals are used to manufacture drugs and medicines for various uses. These
drugs and medicines are collectively known as pharmaceuticals. Some of the
pharmaceuticals are:

— @—rwistevormve10
Analgesics: These are substances that reduce pain. For example: aspirin and
paracetamol.
Antiseptics: These are substances that help to prevent infections in wounds by killing
bacteria; for example, acriflavine.
Sedatives: These are drugs that make a person go to sleep or make them feel calm
and relaxed. Examples of such type of medicines are the barbiturates,
which include several important drugs.
Disinfectants: These are substances used to disinfect something or to kill bacteria; for
example, Dettol.
Sulphonamides: These are medicines used as antibiotics. For example: penicillin.
C. Soaps and Detergents
Organic chemicals are used for the synthesis of soaps and detergents. For example, animal
fat and vegetable oils are used for manufacturing soap. Fats and oils are naturally occurring
esters of glycerol and the higher fatty acids. Long open-chain alcohols and alkyl benzene
sulphonic acid can be used for the production of detergents.
Soaps and detergents are substances used to remove dirt. They are also called surfactants
or surface active agents. This is because they reduce the surface tension of water and
change the surface properties.
Soaps are either sodium or potassium salts of higher (long-chain) carboxylic acids. Soaps
that are sodium salts are called hard soaps and those that are potassium salts are soft
soaps. Soaps are prepared by boiling animal fat or vegetable oil with a base. The reaction
that produces soap 1s called saponification.

Detergents contain either a sulfate or a sulphonate group. One example of detergents is
sodium lauryl sulfate, C,, H,, —O—SO,— ONa. It is prepared first by reacting
dodecyl (lauryl) alcohol with sulphuric acid followed by reaction with
sodium hydroxide.

Preparation of Soap
Objective: To prepare soap from animal fat or vegetable oil.
Materials required: Animal fat or vegetable oil, NaOH, NaCl, measuring cylinder,
beaker, glass rod, Bunsen burner, filter paper, funnel, conical flask, and
test tube.
Procedure:
Measure 3 mL vegetable oil or 3 g animal fat and place it ina 100 mL beaker; add
3 mL of ethanol and 3 mL of 5M NaOH. Stir the mixture vigorously with a glass
rod and gently heat over a flame for 15 minutes or until it turns in to a paste. When
the paste begins to form, stir very carefully to prevent frothing. After all the paste
has formed, set the beaker on the bench to cool. Add about 15 mL of saturated
NaCl solution to the paste mixture and stir thoroughly. This process is called salting
out the soap. Filter off the soap mixture by suction filtration and wash the collected
soap precipitate with 15 mL of ice water.
Observations and analysis:
a Why do we add ethanol during the preparation?
b What is the purpose of adding saturated NaCl solution to the paste mixture?
Write a laboratory report and present to the class.

D. Dry Cleaning
The qualities of some clothes decrease when they are washed with water using ordinary
soap. In order to avoid this, other chemicals are used for washing purposes that remove
dirt in the same manner as soaps. Dry cleaning refers to the use of different chemicals
that are capable of dissolving grease and other dirt stains in a similar manner as soaps
without the use of water. The most commonly used chemicals in dry cleaning are organic
chemicals such as tetrachloromethane, CCL; tetrachloroethylene, Cl,C =CCL,; benzene
and gasoline.
E. Fuels
The term fuel refers to any material that is capable of burning to produce energy, heat and
light. Most fuels occurring in nature are organic compounds. However, some inorganic
substances like hydrogen, producer gas and water gas are also used as gaseous fuels. But,
the most widely used fuels at present are of organic origin. This includes petroleum which
chiefly contains alkanes. Natural gas which is used as a fuel for stoves contains mainly
methane. Gasoline which is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines also contains
alkanes. Paraffin wax which is used to make candles is another fuel to get light energy and
itis amixture of alkanes containing more than twenty carbon atoms. Besides its use as a
constituent of all alcoholic beverages, ethanol can also be used as a fuel for internal
combustion engines. At present, it is one of the substances that we can rely on for use as a
fuel for automobiles. The use of ethanol as a fuel is now practiced in our country by mixing
it with petrol. Ethanol and other plant seed oils can be classified as bio fuels.
Agricultural Applications
Organic compounds also play an important role in agriculture, specially to increase crop
productivity by controlling the damages caused by insects, rodents, fungi, birds and weeds.
So, organic chemicals can be used in the manufacture of pesticides and herbicides.
What is the distinction between herbicides and pesticides?
Pesticides are the chemicals used for controlling the damage that can be caused by fungi,
insects and other pests that attack crops. Among the pesticides, Bordeaux mixture is used
as fungicide. Other chemicals like DDT, aldrine, dieldrine, malathion are used as insecticides.
Herbicides are the chemicals that are applied on agricultural lands to remove unwanted
plants or weeds. Some examples of compounds that are used as herbicides include paraquat,
diquat, ammonium sulphamate, ammonium glyphosinate, sodium chlorate etc.
Fertilizers: In order to increase crop productivity we use either synthetic or natural
fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers are grouped into three classes as nitrogen, potash and
phosphate fertilizers. Nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients. It is absorbed by
plants in the form of nitrate ion, NO, . Nitrogen enables green plants to synthesize amino
acids and proteins, and it is also a constituent of DNA molecules. To provide nitrogen for
~ INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1) >
plants, nitrogen-containing fertilizers are usually added to the soil. These include, ammonium
salts like NH,CL, (NH,),SO,, nitrates like KNO, and urea. Urea is one of the most important
nitrogen fertilizers. It is a component of urine. On an industrial scale, urea is manufactured
by the dehydration of ammonium carbamate:
H,N— COO NH, (s) ——> H,NCONH, (s) + H,0O (g)
It can also be prepared by direct combination of ammonia and carbon dioxide at
180°C and pressure of about 140 atm.

Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, mainly alkanes, and also
contain cycloalkanes and aromatics.
Crude oil is separated into a number of useful fractions by fractional distillation.
Alcohols are compounds containing the hydroxyl (-OH) group as their
functional group and represented by the general formula C_H,,. OH.
Alcohols are classified depending on the number of hydroxyl groups they
contain as monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols.
Monohydric alcohols are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) and
tertiary alcohols (3°).
The names of alcohols contain the suffix ‘-ol’ which indicates the presence
of —OH group in the molecule.
Primary alcohols oxidize to give aldehydes and then carboxylic acids, and
secondary alcohols yield ketones on oxidation.
Organic chemicals have industrial applications such as in the production
of alcoholic beverages and pharmaceuticals.
Organic chemicals are also used in the production offertilizers, pesticides
and weed killers for agricultural uses.
Organic chemicals are also used as fuels, and to produce soaps and
detergents and also for dry cleaning.

By completing this section, you will be able to:
¢ define inorganic compounds; and
¢ classify inorganic compounds as oxides, acids, bases and salts.
Activity 2.1
In the laboratory, take samples of different compounds and classify them as organic and
inorganic. When these compounds are burnt in air, it has been found that most organic
compounds burn when heated in air, but most inorganic compounds just melt or vaporize;
why? Discuss your observations in groups and share your opinion with the class.
Inorganic compounds are the compounds consisting of mineral constituents of the earth
or generally found in non-living things. The term inorganic compound refers to all
compounds that do not contain carbon. Although, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are carbon-containing compounds, which are
classified as inorganic compounds. Inorganic compounds are mostly found in nature as
silicates, oxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, chlorides and nitrates, etc.
There are different ways for the classification of inorganic compounds. They can be
classified on the bases of their composition. For example; they can be classified on
the basis of the:
i) metal they contain such as copper compounds, aluminium compounds, etc.
IMPORTANTINOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT2)
ii) non-metal they contain such as sulphur compounds, nitrogen compounds, etc.

What are oxides? Oxygen reacts directly with almost all elements except the noble
gases and inactive metals like gold, platinum, and palladium. Such compounds of oxygen
are called oxides. Oxides are binary compounds containing oxygen and any other
element (metal, non-metal or metalloid). Binary compounds are those consisting of
— @— cemistayeRADEIO
only two elements. Examples of oxides are calcium oxide, CaO, aluminium oxide,
AL,O,, sulphur dioxide, SO,, and carbon monoxide, CO.
The classification of oxides into different groups is based on their chemical behaviour;
they are classified as:
¢ Acidic oxides
¢ Basic oxides
¢ Amphoteric oxides
¢ Neutral oxides, and
¢ Peroxides

Activity 2.2
1. The oxides, CO., N,O,, P,O.,, SO, are acidic oxides.
a_ Are these oxides formed by the combination of oxygen with
i) metals ii) non-metals or iii) = metalloids?
b What general conclusion can you draw about the composition of acidic oxides?
2. The presence of CO, is confirmed by reacting CO, with lime water.
a What is lime water? Is it a base or an acid?
b Write a balanced chemical equation for the above reaction.
c What type of oxides react with bases?
Discuss in your group and present your findings to the class.
Acidic oxides are the oxides formed by the chemical combination of oxygen with non-
metals. Thus, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. These oxides are also called acid
anhydrides, since they form acidic solutions when reacted or dissolved in water. Acid
anhydride means acid without water.
>
Generally speaking, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. Examples of acidic oxides
include carbon dioxide, CO,, nitrogen dioxide, NO,, and sulphur dioxide, SO,.
However, it is very important to note that all non-metal oxides are not necessarily
acidic oxides. For example, carbon monoxide, CO, and di-nitrogen monoxide, N,O,
are non-metal oxides, but they are neutral oxides which will be discussed later.
Chemical Properties of Acidic Oxides
Acidic oxides undergo the following reactions:
1. Acidic oxides (acid anhydrides) dissolve in water to form acidic solution (acid).
Acid anhydride + water — Acid
Examples
CO, + H,O + _— H,CO, (Carbonic acid)
N,O, + H,O — _— 2HNO, (Nitrous acid)
SO, + H,O + — H,SO, (Sulphurous acid)
2. Acidic oxides react with basic or metallic oxides to form salt.
Acidic oxide + Basic oxide —- _ Salt
Examples
CO, + NaO — Na,CO,
SO; + CaO — CaSO,
3. Acidic oxides react with bases to form salt and water. This reaction is called
neutralization reaction.

B. Basic Oxides
Oxides that are composed of metals and oxygen are basic oxides. But, all metal oxides
are not necessarily basic oxides; for example Al,O, and ZnO are amphoteric oxides,
which will be discussed in part (C).
Oxides of metals that dissolve in water and react with it to form basic or alkaline solutions
are called basic anhydrides. There are metallic oxides which have basic properties but
are insoluble in water. These oxides react with acids to give salt and water.
Example
FeO + 2HCl > FeCl, + HO
The oxides of active metals, group IA and heavier members of group ITA, dissolve in
water and readily form bases. The term base is used to describe both soluble and
insoluble basic oxides. Some examples of basic oxides are Li,O, Na,O, K,O, MgO,
CaO, BaO, and CuO.
Chemical Properties of Basic Oxides
What common reaction do basic oxides undergo? What products do they form
in their reactions with water, acidic oxides and acids?
1. Basic oxides dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. As they dissolve, they
react with water to form the corresponding metal hydroxides.
Basic oxide + water — _ Base (Alkali)
Examples
LiO+H,O — 2LiOH
CaO +H,O ~ Ca(OH),
2. Basic oxides react with acidic oxides to form salts.

Test for Acidity and Basicity of Oxides
Objective: To identify basic and acidic oxides.
Materials required: Deflagrating spoon, gas jar and gas jar lid, test tubes. Sulphur,
magnesium or calcium metal, water, universal indicator, litmus paper (blue
and red).
@ estevcrave10
Procedure:
1. Ignite a small amount of powdered sulphur on a deflagrating spoon and insert
in a gas jar of oxygen. Add 10 mL water after ignition is complete. Cover the
gas jar with a lid and shake. Take two test tubes and pour 5 mL of the
solution to each test tube. Add a few drops of universal indicator solution to
the first test tube and blue litmus paper in the second.
2. Ignite a small amount of magnesium or calcium metal on a deflagrating spoon and
insert in to a gas jar of oxygen. Add 10 mL water to the ash formed and shake. Take
two test tubes and pour 5 mL of the solution to each of the test tubes. Add a few
drops of universal indicator in the first and red litmus paper to the second test tube.
Observations and analysis:
a What compounds are formed by the combustion of sulphur and magnesium or
calcium? Write chemical equations to show the reactions.
b What happens when water is added to the gas jars in which sulphur was burnt?
c What colours are observed by adding drops of universal indicator and blue or
red litmus to the solutions in the test tubes?
d Why does the change in the colour of indicators occur in the various solutions?
Write a laboratory report and submit to your teacher.
Universal indicator and litmus paper serve as indicators. Indicators are substances
used to identify whether a given solution is acidic or basic by showing colour changes.
Table 2.1 shows some common indicators and the colour they develop in acidic and
basic solutions.
Table 2.1 Some common indicators and their colours in acidic and basic solution.
Universal Indicator Yellow - Orange (in weakly acidic) Blue (in weakly basic) and
and red (in strongly acidic) purple (in strongly basic)
Litmus Red Blue
Phenolphthalein Colourless Pink (red)
Methyl orange Red Yellow
In addition to their effects on indicators, acidic and basic oxides can be identified by their
chemical properties. Acidic oxides react with bases while basic oxides react with acids.
But acidic oxides do not react with acids and basic oxides do not react with bases.

C. Amphoteric Oxides
Activity 2.3
1. How would you classify the oxides of period III elements?
2. What trend do you observe in the properties of oxides of the elements in a period as
you go from left to right in the periodic table?
Discuss this in your group and present to the class.
There are oxides which exhibit both acidic and basic properties. These are known as
amphoteric oxides. In their reaction with acids, they behave as bases and, in their
reaction with bases they act as acids. The following reaction shows the amphoteric
behaviour of aluminium oxide, Al,O,.
Amphoteric oxide + Acid > salt + water
ALO, (s) + 6HCI (aq) > 2AICl, (aq) + 3H,0 (1)
Amphoteric oxide + base > salt + water
ALO, (s) + 2NaQOH (aq) —> 2NaAlO, (aq) + H,0 (1)
sodium aluminate
Some other examples of amphoteric oxides are ZnO, PbO, PbO,, SnO, and SnO.,. It
is also important to realize that hydroxides which react with both acids and bases are
described as amphoteric substances. For example, aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH),, reacts
with both acids and bases to form salt and water. So, Al(OH),, is amphoteric in nature.
What is the common characteristic of acidic, basic and amphoteric oxides? Acidic
oxides form salts when reacted with basic oxides and bases. Basic oxides also produce
salts in their reactions with acidic oxides and acids. Amphoteric oxides form salts
when they react with acids and bases. Thus, acidic oxides, basic oxides and amphoteric
oxides are salt-forming oxides.
Exercise 2.5
Write chemical equations to show the amphoteric properties of ZnO and PbO
when they react with:
a HCl
b NaOH
c HNO,
d KOH
Experiment 2.2 AN
Investigating Amphoteric Behaviour of Oxides
Objective: To observe the amphoteric behaviour of AL,O,.
Materials required:
Spatula, reagent bottles, beakers, glass rod, ALO,, HCl, NaOH, Universal
indicator and water.
Procedure:
1. Prepare solutions by:
a mixing 20 mL concentrated HCl and 80 mL water in one reagent bottle;
b_ dissolving 8 g NaOH in 100 mL water in another reagent bottle.
c Add universal indicator to the acid and base, and observe the colour change.
Take two beakers and place a spatula full of Al,O, in each of the beakers.
Pour the HCI solution (which you prepared) into one of the beakers and NaOH
solution into the other. Stir the mixture with a glass rod.
4. Add universal indicator in the two beakers and observe the colour change.
Observations and analysis:
I. Does ALO, react with the substances in both solutions?
2. What does the change in colour of the indicator in the mixtures indicate?
3. Write chemical equations to show what has happened?
Write a laboratory report and present to the class.
D. Neutral Oxides
Neutral oxides react neither with acids nor with bases to form salt and water. Hence,
neutral oxides do not show basic and acidic properties. Examples of neutral oxides
are water, H,O, carbon monoxide, CO, dinitrogen monoxide, N,O, and nitrogen
monoxide, NO. Neutral oxides are very few in number.

with the oxidation number of the compound used for decolorizing hair.
Discuss your findings in group and present to the class.
E. Peroxides
In acidic, basic, amphoteric and neutral oxides, the oxidation state of oxygen is —2,
but in peroxides it is —1. In peroxides, the two oxygen atoms are linked to each other
and with atoms of other elements. They contain the peroxide, “— O — O —” link. In
the oxides discussed above, oxygen atoms are linked directly with atoms of other elements.
Some examples of peroxides are hydrogen peroxide, H,O,, sodium peroxide, Na,O,,
calcium peroxide, CaO,, barium peroxide, BaO,, and strontium peroxide, SrO,,.
Most peroxides of metals are formed by burning the metals in a sufficient amount of oxygen.
2Na(s) + O, (g) > Na,O, (s)
Ca (s) + O, (g) = CaO, (Ss)
Chemical Properties of Peroxides
What chemical properties do the peroxides exhibit? Some of the chemical properties
of peroxides include:
a Peroxides are powerful oxidizing agents; they react with different substances
by losing oxygen.
Examples
PbS (s) + 4H,O, (aq) — PbSO,(s) + 4H,O ()
2KI (aq) + H,SO, (aq) + H,O, (aq) > I, (s) + K,SO,(aq) + 2H,O (1)
b _Peroxides react with aqueous acids to form hydrogen peroxide.
Examples
Na,O, (s) + 2HCI (aq) — 2NaCl (aq) + H,O, (aq)
CaO, (s) + H,SO, (aq) — CaSO, (s) + H,O, (aq)
Hydrogen Peroxide
The structure of the hydrogen peroxide molecule is:
— @&— Gemstevcrvero
Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to release oxygen. This reaction is slow but can be
speeded up by the addition of manganese (IV) oxide, MnO,,, as a catalyst.
2H,O,(aq) — 2H,O (I) + O,(g)
Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent. Its oxidizing power is responsible for
its effectiveness as an antiseptic for mouthwash and cleansing wounds. It is also used
as a bleaching agent. When hydrogen peroxide is added to a coloured dye, the molecule
responsible for the colour will oxidize and so the colour will disappear. For example,
if hydrogen peroxide is added to a black dye (paint) that contains lead sulphide, PbS,
the black colour turns white. This is due to the oxidation of PbS to PbSO,. The
equation for this process 1s:
PbS (s) + 4H,O, — PbSO, + 4H,0 (1)

IMPORINOGANICT COMPOUNADS (UNTN2) T
Acids are among the most familiar of all chemical compounds. Acetic acid in vinegar,
citric acid in lemons and other citrus fruits, are among the acids that we encounter
every day. Hydrochloric acid is the acid in gastric juice; it is essential to digestion.
Phosphoric acid gives flavour to many carbonated beverages.
Definitions of Acids
a Arrhenius Definition of Acids
The simplest definition of acids is suggested by Savante Arrhenius, a Swedish Chemist.
Arrhenius defined an acid as a substance that releases hydrogen ion or proton, H*, or
hydronium ion, H,O", in aqueous solution.
Example
HClaq) — Haq) + Cag)
or,
HClag) + H,O0) —> H,O*%(aq) + ~ CF(aq)
Some examples of Arrhenius acids are HCl, HNO,, H,SO,, HI, HBr, and HF. For a
substance to be called an Arrhenius acid, it should contain ionizable hydrogen.
Despite its early success and usefulness, the definition of an acid, first proposed by
Arrhenius has some limitations. The Arrhenius definition of acids explains their behaviour
only in aqueous solution. In addition, it does not explain why some substances show
acidic behaviour in the gaseous state and in non-aqueous solutions.
For example, when ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases are brought together, they
react to form ammonium chloride as follows:
NH,(g) + HCl(g) > NH,CI(s)
In this reaction, the hydrogen chloride provides hydrogen ion (or proton), H*, which
reacts with NH, to form NH,". But, this happens in the gaseous state not in aqueous
solution. Due to the limitations of Arrhenius’ definition, chemists tried to define acids in
a more general way.
Bronsted-Lowry Definition of Acids
A broader and more general definition of acids was provided independently in 1923,
by Johannes Bronsted and Thomas M. Lowry. According to Bronsted-Lowry definition;
an acid is a substance that donates protons, H*, to some other substance.
mx¢ © CHEMISTRYGRADE10,
Examples
HCI (aq) + H,O (1) —> H,O* (aq) + CT (aq)
NH, (aq) + H,O () = NH, (aq) + OH (aq)
HPO, (aq) + 2H,O(I) = HPOF (aq) + 2H,O0* (aq)
In the above reactions, HCI in the first, H,O in the second and H,PO, in the third
are Bronsted-Lowry acids because they are proton donors. Here it is very important
to realize that all Arrhenius acids are Bronsted-Lowry acids. However, the reverse
is not true because Bronsted-Lowry acids include substances that are not acids
according to Arrhenius.
Although the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid is more general than the definition
proposed by Arrhenius, it still depends on the transfer of protons. However, the
presence of acids that are not proton-donors, initiated chemists to search for another
definition of acids.
b Lewis Definition of Acids
In 1923, the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis produced a definition of acid
that extends the concept of acids even further than that of Bronsted-Lowry.
According to Lewis, an acid is a substance that can form a coordinate covalent
bond by accepting an electron pair from another substance. In other words, an
acid is an electron-pair acceptor. Consider the following reactions:
F F
F—B+QFi ——> |F—B<—F
F F
Lewis acid
In the above reaction, between BF, and F-, BF, acts as a Lewis acid since it accepts
a pair of electrons from F-.
The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Arrhenius concept of an acid.
This is because as the acid releases an hydrogen ion, H*, in aqueous solution, the
released proton or H* accepts a pair of electrons from a water molecule to form an
hydronium, H,O° ion.
a o |
aN x |
H H H 7H
Lewis acid Hydronium ion
The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Bronsted-Lowry concept of
acids. Since Bronsted-Lowry defined an acid as a proton donor, the donated proton
can be accepted by a molecule or species that has lone pair of electrons. So the
proton, HTM, is an electron pair acceptor and hence a Lewis acid. Consider the
following reaction.
NH; (g) + H,O() = NHj (aq) + _ OH (aq)
In this reaction, H,O is a proton donor and hence a Bronsted-Lowry acid. The donated
proton from water to ammonia, accepts a pair of electrons from the nitrogen atom in
NH, to form NH," as shown below:
| |
nnd e —» |H-—N—>H

Lewis acid
The Lewis concept of acids not only includes H” as an acid, but also ions or molecules
capable of accepting an electron pair that neither release H* in aqueous solution nor
donate a proton.
Classification of Acids
Activity 2.6
Phosphoric acid, H,PO,, has three hydrogen atoms and it is a triprotic acid. Acetic acid,
CH,COOH, has four hydrogen atoms and is classified as a monoprotic acid. Discuss the
reason in your group and present it to the class.
There are different ways of classifying acids; they can be classified depending on the
number of replaceable (ionizable) hydrogen atom(s) they contain per molecule as
monoprotic or polyprotic acids.
Monoprotic acids are the acids containing only one ionizable (replaceable)
hydrogen atom per molecule or those acids that can furnish only one hydrogen
107
@— aemstevcraver0
ion per molecule in aqueous solution. Common examples of monoprotic acids are
HCl, HNO,, HBr, HI, and CH,COOH. The ionization of a monoprotic acid in aqueous
solution is presented using HCl and HNO, as specific examples, as shown below:
HCl (aq) 7- H* (aq) + Cl (aq)
HNO, (aq) > HH’ (aq) + — NO; (aq)
Polyprotic acids are those acids containing more than one ionizable (replaceable)
hydrogen ion in aqueous solution. Example of acids in this category includes H,SO,,
H,CO,, and H,PO,.
The ionization of polyprotic acids in aqueous solution is shown in the following chemical
equations:
H,SO, (aq) > 2H* (aq) + SO (aq)
H,CO, (aq) = 2H’ (aq) + CO} (aq)
HPO, (aq) = 3H*(aq) + PO} (aq)
Polyprotic acids which contain two ionizable hydrogen atoms such as H,SO,, H,S,
and H,CO, are also called diprotic acids; those containing three ionizable hydrogen
atoms like H,PO, are called triprotic acids.
Activity 2.7
Ammonia and phosphoric acid have three hydrogen atoms but ammonia does not behave
as triprotic acid. Why? Discuss in your group and present it to the class.
Acids can also be classified depending on the number of their constituent elements as
binary and ternary acids. Binary acids are those acids composed of only two elements.
Examples of binary acids are HCl, HBr, HF, HI, and HS.
Ternary acids also called oxy-acids are acids composed of three different elements.
They usually contain hydrogen, oxygen and a non-metal. Examples are H,SO,, H,CO,,
HCIO,, and H,PO,.
General Properties of Acids
Activity 2.8
Add a drop of lemon juice on your tongue and try to identify its taste. Repeat your
observation with orange juice. Do the two juices taste bitter or sour? Try to classify them
as acid or base, depending on their taste. Share your observations with the rest of class.
Acids generally have the following properties:
1. Acids have a sour taste
Aqueous solutions of acids have a sour taste. Lemon juice and orange Juice taste
sour due to the presence of citric acid. Citric acid is harmless. However, most
concentrated acids are corrosive and poisonous. So it is strictly forbidden to attempt
to identify such acids by tasting them.
2. Acids change the colour of indicators
The common indicators available in high school laboratories are litmus,
phenolphthalein, methyl orange or methyl red and universal indicator. The effect of
acids on the colour of indicators is summarized in Table2.1, Section 2.2.

3. Acids react with active metals to form salt and hydrogen gas
Metals like magnesium, zinc, and iron react with dilute acids to form salt and liberate
hydrogen gas.
Acid + Active metal — Salt + Hydrogen gas
Examples
2HCl «6+ = Mm 68>) 6M, Ct CU
H,SO, + Mg —> MgSO, + 4H,
Very active metals like sodium, potassium, and calcium react very violently with dilute
acids. The reaction is very dangerous and should not be performed.
Acids reacting with metals do not necessarily produce hydrogen gas. For example,
concentrated nitric acid and hot concentrated sulphuric acid react with copper producing
nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide gases, respectively, instead of hydrogen. This is
because concentrated HNO, and hot concentrated H,SO, are oxidizing acids. The
reactions of these acids with copper are given by the following equations:
Cu + 4HNO, -> ~ Cu(NO,), + 2NO, + 2H,0
Cu + 2H,SO, —> CuSO, + SO, + 2H,O

Strength of Acids (Strong and Weak Acids)
Activity 2.9
1. Add a few drops of citric acid solution and nitric acid separately on a piece of waste
cotton cloth; what happens? Based on your observations, can you classify these acids as
weak acid or strong acid?
2. You are allowed to taste some acids like acetic acid (in the form of vinegar), and citric
acid at home, but you are never allowed to taste any kind of acids in the laboratory.
What is the reason?
Discuss your findings in your group and present to the class.
Acids can be classified as strong acids and weak acids depending on their degree of
ionization in aqueous solution, i.e., the extent to which the acids dissociate to form
hydrogen or hydronium ions when they dissolve in water. A strong acid is one that
ionizes almost completely in aqueous solution. Examples of strong acids are HCIO,,
HI, HBr, HCl, HNO,, and H,SO,. These acids dissociate to a very high extent as
shown below:
HCI (aq) > H* (aq) + Cl (aq)
HNO, (aq) > HTM (aq) + NO; (aq)
HClO, (aq) — H*(aq) + ClO; (aq)
A dilute aqueous solution of strong acids contains predominantly the ions derived from
the acids instead of the acid molecules. For example, HCI and HNO, are almost
completely ionized in water.
IMPORINTOGANIC ACOMPOUNNDS (UNITT 2)
An acid that releases few hydrogen ions in aqueous solution is a weak acid. The
aqueous solution of a weak acid contains hydronium ions, anions and dissolved
molecules of the acid.
Organic acids which contain the acidic carboxyl group -COOH, are generally weak
acids. For example, CH,COOH, ionizes slightly in water to give hydronium ions and
acetate ions, CH,COOTM.
CH,COOH (aq) + H,O(l) = CH,COOTM (aq) + H,0*(aq)
Concentrated and Diluted Acids
Activity 2.10
1. In a solution, if there is 95% H,O and the rest is HCI, what kind of solution is it?
2. Ina car battery, the electrolyte used is 35% of H,SO,. How many percent of it is water?
What do you think about the concentration of the electrolyte?
“Concentrated” and “dilute” are terms used to describe the relative amount of acid in
a given acid solution.
A concentrated acid contains a relatively large amount (percentage) of acid and a
small amount of water. For example, concentrated sulphuric acid is 98% H,SO, and
2% water. Concentrated acetic acid is 99% acetic acid and 1% water. But, H,SO, is
a strong acid and CH,COOH a weak acid.
A dilute acid contains a relatively small amount of acid dissolved in large amount of
water. For example, a diluted solution of sulphuric acid may contain 10% H,SO, and
90% H,O.
The concentration of an acid is the measure of the number of moles of the acid in one
litre of acid solution and is expressed in mol/L. This unit of concentration is called
Molarity, denoted by M. Mathematically,
Number of moles of the substance dissolved
Molarity (M) =
Volume of solution in litres
Mass of the substance dissolved in grams
Number of mol|e s of the substance = Molar mass of the substance
For example, the concentration of 98% H,SO, is about 18 mol/L. If one litre of this
acid is added to 2 litres of water to make 3 litres of solution, the concentration will
@ ceistevcraven0
become 6 mol/L. The new solution obtained is a dilute solution of H,SO,. Thus,
concentrated acids contains a greater number of moles of acid while dilute acids contain
less number of moles of the acid per litre of the acid solution.
Example
How many moles of HCl are present in 0.8 L of a 0.5 7 HCI solution?
Solution:
= 7 = MV= 05 1 x 08 L = 04 mol HCl, where Mf is the
molarity, 7, the number of moles and V, volume of solution in litre.
An important aspect of the property of acids is that they conduct electricity in aqueous
solutions, i.e., the acids are electrolytes. The extent of conduction of electricity depends
on the amount of ions present in the solution. Thus, aqueous solutions of strong acids
are better conductors of electricity than the same concentrations of weak acid solutions.
The conduction of electricity through acid solution is also used as one means of
identification between weak and strong acids.
Experiment 2.8

Precautions when Handling Acids
Concentrated acids are extremely corrosive and poisonous. They can destroy metals
and clothes; produce a chemical burn on skin or inside the body. If taken internally
they can be fatal. So acids must be handled with care.
The following precautions are helpful while working with acids:
a Wear goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat.
b Ifaconcentrated acid is spilled or splashed on your body, first wash the affected
part with running water and then with 10% Na,CO, solution.
c If concentrated acid is spilled on to cloth, immediately wash it with running water.
d Ifan acid enters your eye, wash with water repeatedly and then consult a doctor.
117
mux? | CHEMISTRYGRADE10,
e If corrosive acids are swallowed, administer weak bases such as Mg(OH), or
Al(OH).
f Use bellows to pipette acid instead of sucking using yours lips.
g To dilute concentrated acids, pour the concentrated acid in to water and not
water in to the acid.
DH and pH scale
Expressing acidity as the concentration of H,O* can be cumbersome because the
values tend to be very small. A more convenient quantity called pH is used to indicate
the concentration of H,O°. The letter pH stands for the French words pouvoir
hydrogéne, meaning “hydrogen power”.
pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the Aydrogen ion concentration (hydronium
ion concentration). The mathematical expression is:
l
pH = log = — log [H"]
[H"]
The square bracket [ ] means concentration in mol/L.
To calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution from its pH we can proceed
as follows.
[H*] = antilog (-pH) = 10-P#
The pH of a solution can be measured using universal indicator solution, pH indicator
paper or a pH-meter. When universal indicator solution or pH indicator papers are
added to an acid solution, they develop different colours depending on the pH of the
solution. So, to identify the pH, we need to compare the colour developed with the
standard colour chart. A pH meter is an electronic device, which reads the pH of a
solution directly. (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3. a) The colour of universal indicator in solutions of pH from 1 to 12,
b) ApH meter with its electrical probe dipped into an orange.
Acidity and alkalinity are usually expressed on the pH scale. The range is between 0
and 14.
. Acidity increases Basicity increases
Strong acid Weak acid Weak base Strong base
Neutral
A neutral solution has a pH value of 7 at 298 K. Acidic solutions have pH values less
than 7. As the pH value decreases the acidity of the solution increases. For example,
if two solutions A and B have pH values of 4 and 6, respectively, then we can conclude
that solution A is more acidic than solution B. The hydrogen ion concentration in
solution A is one hundred times greater than that in B.
The following examples will guide us through how to calculate pH values of solutions.
Example
Calculate the pH of a 0.001 M solution of HC1?
Solution:
HCI is a strong acid and dissociates almost completely.
The dissociation of 0.001 M (0.001 mol/L) of HCI produces 0.001 mol/L of
H* and 0.001 mol/L of Cl as follows:
HCl (aq) — Haq) + _ CE (aq)
0.001 mol/L 0.001mol/L 0.001 mol/L
Thus, [H*] = 0.001 mol/L = 1 x 107M
pH =-—log [H*] =-— log 1 x 107 =3
Example
The hydrogen ion concentration in a dilute solution of vinegar is 4.6 x 10° M.
What is the pH of the solution?
Solution:
pH = — log [H*] = — log (4.6 x 10>) =— (log 4.6 + log 10-°)
=~ (log 4.6 — 5) = — (0.663 — 5) = 4.337
Example
The pH of lemon juice was determined to be 3. What is the hydrogen ion
concentration in the lemon juice?
Solution:
pH = — log [H"]; —pH = log [H"]
[H*] = antilog (-pH) = 10°" = 103M
Exercise 2.7
1. The pH of a given solution is 8. What is the hydrogen ion concentration of the
solution?
2. Two solutions A and B have pH values of 2 and 6 respectively. How many
times greater is the hydrogen ion concentration in solution A than that of
solution B?

Bases belong to the class of inorganic compounds that include most oxides and
hydroxides of metals. They are of great importance in chemical industries and in our
daily lives, directly or indirectly. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH is used in the
production of soap, paper, textile etc. Potassium hydroxide, KOH is used to produce
soft soap, fertilizers etc. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH),, is used to manufacture mortar
and bleaching powder, to remove soil acidity etc.
Definition of Bases
There are different definitions of bases, as suggested by different chemists namely Arrhenius,
Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis.
— @&— Gemstevcrvero
Arrhenius definition of bases: A base is any substance that ionizes (dissociates) in
aqueous solution to release hydroxide, OH” ions. Arrhenius bases are mostly ionic
metal hydroxides such as, LiOH, NaOH, KOH and Ba(OH),. The dissociation of a
few bases is shown by the following equations:
NaOH (aq) > Na’ (aq) + OH (aq)
Ba(OH), (aq) —> Ba** (aq) + 20H (aq)
Bronsted-Lowry definition of bases: A base is a substance that is capable of
accepting proton(s), H’. Thus, a base is a proton, H* acceptor.
Note:
Note that not all Bronsted-Lowry bases are Arrhenius bases, but all Arrhenius
bases contain the hydroxide ion which is a Bronsted-Lowry base. This is because
OH: can accept a proton, H*, to form water.
According to the Bronsted-Lowry definition, an acid-base reaction is the transfer of a
proton from an acid to a base.
Example
NH, (aq) + HCl(aq) — NH, (aq) + CT (aq)
Base Acid
HCO, (aq) + OH (aq) = COZ (aq) + HOC)
Acid Base
Lewis Definition of Bases
The Lewis definition is a more general definition than the Arrhenius and Bronsted-
Lowry definitions. According to Lewis, a base is a substance that is capable of
donating a pair of electrons. In other words, a base is an electron-pair donor.
Brensted-Lowry bases are also bases according to the Lewis concept. This is
because for Bronsted-Lowry bases to accept a proton, H* they should have a
lone pair. However, Lewis base include other species that can form a coordinate
covalent bond by sharing their lone pair with substances other than a proton, H”.
It is important to note that Lewis acid-base reactions include many reactions that
do not involve protons. The following equation shows an acid-base reaction
according to Lewis concept:

General Properties of Bases
Activity 2.14
Dissolve one table-spoon of washing soda in a glass of water. Try to wash your hands with
this solution. How do you feel? Does it give a soapy touch or an oily touch. Share your
observations with the rest of the class.
Bases like NaOH, KOH, and Ba(OH), are readily soluble in water, while others such as
Mg(OH), are slightly soluble. Bases that are soluble in water are also called alkalis.
Bases or alkalis show the following properties:
1. Bases are slippery to the touch and have a bitter taste: Bases have a bitter
taste; feel slippery to the skin in dilute aqueous solutions. Strong bases such as
NaOH and KOH are very corrosive and poisonous. So they should be neither
brought in to contact with the skin nor tasted.
2. Soluble bases change the colour of indicators: Aqueous solutions of bases
turn the colour of red litmus to blue, phenolphthalein to pink (red), methyl red to
yellow and universal indicator blue (purple).
3. Soluble bases release hydroxide ion in aqueous solution: The characteristic
properties of bases in aqueous solutions are due to the presence of the hydroxide
ion, OH” which they release on dissolution.
Examples
KOH (aq) > K* (aq) + OH (aq)
Ca(OH), (aq) == Ca’* (aq) + 2OH- (aq)
4. Bases neutralize acids or acidic oxides to form salt and water:
Base + Acid (or acidic oxide) — Salt + Water
Examples
2NaOH (aq) + H,SO, (aq) — NaSO, (aq) + 2H,O (1)
2KOH (aq) + SO; (g) —> K,SO, (aq) + H,O()
Ca(OH), (aq) + 2HCl(aq) — CaCl, (aq) + 2H,O (1)
5. Aqueous solutions of bases conduct electricity: Soluble bases are electrolytes.
Solutions of strong bases are good conductors while solutions of weak bases are
poor conductors.
Strength of Bases (Strong and Weak Bases)
Activity 2.15
Is a concentrated base a strong base and a dilute base a weak base? Discuss in your
group and present to the class.
Both acids and bases are classified as strong and weak depending on their degree of
ionization (dissociation) in aqueous solution.
Strong bases are those which ionize (dissociate) completely or almost completely in
water solutions. Examples of strong bases include hydroxides of alkali (Group IA)
metals and lower members of alkaline earth metals such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and
Ba(OR),.
Examples
LiOH (aq) —> Li’ (aq) + OH" (aq)
KOH (aq) —-> K* (aq) + OH" (aq)
IMPOIRNOGANICT COMPOUNADS (UNITN2) T
Weak bases are those bases which ionize (dissociate) only partially or slightly in aqueous
solution. Examples of weak bases include NH,, and Ca(OH)..
The dissociation of a weak base can be shown as follows using, NH,, as an example.
NH,(g) + H,O() = NH,*(aq) + OH (aq)
The double arrow shows that the dissociation of a weak base does not proceed to
completion. This means an aqueous solution of a weak base contains only a small
amount of ions derived from the dissociation of the base and a large amount of the
non-ionized base. For example, a solution of ammonia containing 0.1 mole NH, per
litre of solution ionizes only to the extent of 1.3%.
Concentrated and Dilute Bases
Concentrated and dilute solutions are terms used to describe the amount of a substance
present in a given volume of solution. The amount can be described in terms of either
percentage or number of moles. Concentrated bases contain relatively large amounts
of a base in a given volume of solution while dilute base solutions contain only a small
amount of base. The concentration of a base is the measure of the number of moles
of the alkali (base) dissolved in one litre of solution. The concentration is expressed
in terms of mole per litre (Molarity).
number of moles of the base
Molarity of the base = volume of solution in litres
The greater the number of moles of the base per litre of the solution the more
concentrated is the solution. For example, a solution containing ten moles of NaOH
per litre is more concentrated than the solution containing two moles of NaOH per
litre. The latter solution is more dilute than the former. Thus, both a strong base and a
weak base may be concentrated or dilute depending on the number of moles of the
base present per litre.
Precautions when Handling Bases
Strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide can attack human
skin, and even damage animal and plant tissues. That is why NaOH and KOH are
named caustic soda and caustic potash respectively. The word “caustic” refers to a
substance that can cause burning. Thus, it is very important to avoid the contact of
bases with any part of our body or clothing. Not only strong bases but weak bases
are also corrosive. For example, concentrated ammonia solution can cause blindness if
splashed into the eye.
mud — CHEMISTRYGRADE 10
The following safety precautions are useful in handling bases in school laboratories or
anywhere while working with them.
a Wear eye goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat.
If bases are spilled on your working table wipe the spillages immediately.
c Whenever bases are splashed on your cloth, wash the affected part with running
water.
d Ifa base enters your eyes, wash with water repeatedly as first aid treatment
and seek medical advice.
e Ifa base is swallowed by accident, drink 1-2% acetic acid or lemon juice
immediately.
f Whenever bases come in to contact with your skin, wash the affected part with
plenty of water and then wash the affected part with a very dilute solution (about
1%) of a weak acid such as acetic acid.
pOH
Activity 2.16
1. Since water, H,O, has H* and OH,, it is both acidic and basic. Is this true?
2. If [OH] increases in a solution what happens to its [H*]? Share your comments with
your group.
pH is the measure of the hydrogen (H") or hydronium (H,O") ion concentration in a
solution. In the same manner, pOH is the measure of the hydroxide, OH” ion
concentration in a solution. It also measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution as
pH does.
pOH is defined as the negative logarithm of hydroxide, OH’ ion concentration.
pOH = -log [OH]
To calculate the hydroxide ion concentration from a given pOH value, we proceed as
follows:
[OH-] = antilog (-pOH) = 10-P°°#
Relationship Between pH and pOH
How can you derive the mathematical relationship between pH and pOH? To
understand the relationship between pH and pOH let us start from the ionization of
water. Water undergoes ionization to a small extent as follows:
H,O() = H'*(aq) + OH (aq)
= IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS (UNIT 2) mm
or
2H,O (I) =} H,O*(aq) + OH (aq)
We can write a mathematical expression for the ionic product of water or dissociation
constant for water, Kas
K, = [H*] [OH-] = [H,0*] [OH] (2.1)
K, = 1.0 x 10-4 (mol/L) at 25°C
Since water is neutral, [H"] = [OH] or [H,0*] = [OH]. So we can write equation
2.1 as
kK. = [H"] [OH] = [H*? = 1.0 = 10-(mol/L)?
Solving for [H*]
[H*] = qi.o-10 (mo = 1.0107 mol/L
Thus, in any neutral aqueous solution at 25°C,
[H*] = [OH-] = 1.0 x 10-7 mol/L
In an acid solution, [H*] > [OH7] and in a basic solution, [OH-] > [H*]. However,
the product [H*] x [OH] remains constant, i.e., 1.0 x 10-!4 at 25°C. Thus, if the
concentration of either H* or OH” is known in a given solution, we can calculate the
concentration of the other.
Sw
[H"]’ [oH |
[OH] = [H"]=
To find the relationship between pH and pOH let us begin with equation 2.1.
K,, = [H*] [OH] = 1.0 « 10-4 (mol/L)?
Take the negative logarithm of both sides
—log K, =—log [H*] [OH] =—log 1.0 x 10
—log K. =-log [H*] + (log [OH]) =—log 1.0 x10
but, -log K,. = pK,
—log [OH] = pOH,
log [H"] = pH
-log 1.0 x 10-4 = 14
So, the above equation becomes
pk, = pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C) (2.2)
Thus, the sum of pH and pOH is 14 for any aqueous solution, at 25°C. Since pH,
pOH, [HTM] and [OH] are interrelated through K, knowing any one of the values
enables us to determine the others.
Table 2.2: Acidity and Basicity in relation to [H*], [OH], pH and pOH.
Solution [H*] (mol/L) [OH7] (mol/L) pH pOH
Acidic solution > 107 < 107 <7 >7
Basic solution < 10°” > 107 >7 <7
Example
The hydroxide ion concentration in a solution is 5.0 x 10M? Calculate:
a pOH b [H'] c pH
Solution:
a To calculate pOH we proceed as follows.
pOH = — log [OH"] = — log (5 x10) = — (log10~> — log 5)
=5-log5=43
b [H’] is calculated using the relationship
Kw 1.0x104 (moV/L)’
a]+] ———[—O—H—— —|— = 5.010 mol/L = 2.0 «1—010M
c pH =-log [H*] =-—log 2.0 x 10-!°
= 10 - log 2 = 9.7
Since the pOH of the solution is found in part (a), we can also calculate the
pH using the relationship
pH + pOH = 14
pH + 4.3 = 14
pH = 14-43 =9.7
Exercise 2.9
1. Determine the [OH-] in 3 x 10° M solution of HCI.
2. Determine the pH of 2.0 x 10° M Sr(OH), solution assuming complete

Uses of Some Important Bases
Sodium hydroxide, NaOH: This is known by the common name lye or caustic soda.
It is one of the most important laboratory and industrial chemicals. It is used in the
laboratory for absorbing carbon dioxide and other acidic gases, in a number of organic
reactions and in chemical analysis. Industrially, it is used in the manufacture of soaps
and detergents, pulp and paper, textiles, dyes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, in purifying
aluminium ore and petroleum refining. It is also used to clean drains since it dissolves
grease and other organic matter.
Potassium hydroxide, KOH: It is commonly known as caustic potash. It is a stronger
base and is more expensive than NaOH and has limited uses. It 1s used as an electrolyte
in some dry cells and to make soft soap.
Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH),: It is also called slaked lime or lime water when it is
dissolved in water. It is a weaker base than NaOH and KOH, and is widely used to
remove soil acidity, to make mortar (mixture of lime, sand and water) which serves
as binding material for bricks and plastering walls, to remove temporary hardness of
water and in manufacturing bleaching powder. Its aqueous solution is also used to test
for carbon dioxide gas.
Ammonia: A solution of gaseous ammonia, NH, in water is used as household cleaning
agent and as a laboratory reagent. It is used to manufacture ammonium fertilizers,

2. Make a list of coloured salts available in your school laboratory.
3. Which salts are found in Dalol area, Ethiopia?
Salts are ionic compounds that contain positive ions (cations) derived from bases and
negative ions (anions) derived from acids. Salts are also defined as ionic compounds
formed when the ionizable hydrogen of acids are partly or completely replaced by
metal ions or ammonium ions. For example, Ca(HCO,), and CaCO, are salts derived
from the acid H,CO, while the salts Mg(H,PO,),, MgHPO, and Mg,(PO,), are
salts derived from H,PO,.
¢ A salt is produced when an acid is neutralized by a base:
Acid + Base —> ~~ Salt + #£4Water
Examples
HCI (aq) + NaOH (aq) — NaCl(aq) + H,O (1)
H,SO, (aq) + Ca(OH), (aq) — CaSO,(s) + 2H,0 (1)
Some common examples of salts are sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium carbonate
(CaCO,), potassium nitrate (KNO,), copper sulfate (CuSO,) etc.
Classification of Salts
Activity 2.18

a What would be the nature of the salt, if all the acid hydrogen ions are not replaced by
metal ions or ammonium ion?
©IMPORTANTINOCORUMPGOUNADS N(UNIIT2)C
fb What would be the nature of the salt, if all the base hydroxide ions are not replaced by
the anions of the acid?
Discuss in your group and present the findings to the class.
Salts can be classified as:
¢ Acidic salts: These are salts in which not all of the hydrogen ions in an acid have
been replaced by metal ions or ammonium (NH)) ions.
Example: Sodium hydrogen sulphate, NaHSO,.
When acidic salts are dissolved to make an aqueous solution, they release H*
ions which make the solution acidic. For example, NaHSO, releases ions in
aqueous solution as follows:
NaHSO, (aq) — Na‘(aq) + H*(aq) + SO? (aq)
* Normal salts: These are salts in which all of the hydrogen ions in an acid
have been replaced by metal ions or ammonium ions.
Example: Sodium sulphate, Na,SO,.
Normal salts do not contain ionizable Ht or OH-.
Example
Na,SO, release ions as follows:
Na,SO, (aq) — 2Na*(aq) + SO% (aq)
¢ Basic salts: These are salts in which not all of the hydroxide ions in a base
have been replaced by the anions of the acid.
Example: Zinc hydroxychloride, Zn(OH)CL.
When basic salts are dissolved to make an aqueous solution, they release OHTM
ions and this makes the solution basic.
Zn(OH)Cl (aq) — Zn** (aq) + OH-(aq) + CI (aq)
Preparation of Salts
Activity 2.19
List a few methods to prepare sodium chloride in the laboratory? Discuss in groups and
present it to the class.
md _ CHEMISTRYGRADE 10,
Salts can be prepared by the following methods:
1. Direct combination of elements: This method is used to prepare binary
salts, that is, salts consisting of only two elements.
Examples
2Na(s) + ClL(g) 4 2NaCl (s)
Fe (s) + S() > FeS (s)
Fe (s) + 3CL(g) > = 2FeCl, (s)
2. Reacting active metals with dilute acids:
Active metal + Acid — Salt + Hydrogen gas
Examples
2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) — 2AICl,(aq) + 3H,(g)
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) 7 MgCl, (aq) + H, (g)
Zn(s) + H,SO,(aq) > ZnSO,(aq) + H, (g)
Since, the reactions of metals of Group IA like sodium and potassium are very
vigorous, it is advisable not to use the metals of Group IA for the preparation
of salts by this method.
Sometimes, the reaction of active metals with dilute acids to prepare salts may
not be as successful as expected. For example, calcium sulphate is only sparingly
soluble in water. So in the reaction with dilute sulphuric acid, calcium tends to
become coated with calctum sulphate which inhibits the reaction from proceeding.
3. Reacting metal oxides with acids (by neutralizing basic oxides with
dilute acids):
Metal oxide + £Dilute acid — #£Salt + £Water
Examples
CaO (s) + 2HCI (aq) > CaCl, (aq) + H,O (J)
CuO (s) + H,SO, (aq) — CuSO, (aq) + H,0 (I)
ZnO (s) + 2HNO, (aq) — Zn(NO,), (aq) + H,O (1)
4. Reacting metal hydroxides with dilute acids: This reaction is commonly called
neutralization.
Metal hydroxides + Dilute acid — Salt + Water
Examples
NaOH (aq) + HCI (aq) —> NaCl (aq) + HAO ()
2KOH (aq) + H,SO,(aq) — ~~ K,SO, (aq) + 2H,0 (1)
5. Reacting metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates with dilute acids:
The reaction of carbonates or hydrogen carbonates with dilute acids always
releases carbon dioxide gas along with the formation of a salt and water.
Metal carbonates + Dilute acid — Salt + Water + Carbon dioxide
Examples
MgCO, (s) + H,SO, (aq) — MgSO, (aq) + CO, (g) + H,0()
CuCO, (s) + 2HCl(aq) > CuCl,(aq) + HO) + CO, (@)
Na,CO, (s) + 2HNO, (aq) > 2NaNO, (ag) + H,O (1) + CO, (g)
Ca(HCO,), (s)+ 2HCI(aq) — CaCl, (aq) + 2H,O () + 2C0, (g)
6. Double decomposition reaction (double displacement reaction): In this
method, two different soluble salts react to form a soluble and an insoluble salt
as products that can be separated easily.
Examples
Pb(NO,), (aq) + Nal (aq) — Pbl, (s) + 2NaNO, (aq)
CaCl, (aq) + Na,CO, (aq) — CaCO, (s) + 2NaCl (aq)
It may be noted that each method of preparing salts cannot be used to make
every Salt; 1.e., different methods may be used to make different salts.

Sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) is widely used in the preparation and
preservation of food, as raw a material for the manufacture of sodium, chlorine, and
sodium hydroxide. It is used as component of Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) that has
medical applications. It is also used to manufacture baking soda (NaHCO,) and
Na,CO, that serve as raw materials for the production of glass.
Ammonium nitrate, (NH,NO,) is used as a nitrogenous fertilizer and in explosives.
|IMPOINORRGANIC COTUMPOUNDAS (UNT2N) T
Copper (II) sulphate, (CuSO,) is used to make Bordeaux mixture (mixture of CuSO,
and Ca(OH),) and other fungicides. Bordeaux mixture is used to prevent fungal attack
of leaves and vines. CuSO, is also useful in electroplating.
Iron (III) chloride, (FeCl,) is used in the treatment of waste water, and in etching
printed circuits.
Potassium nitrate, (KNO,) is used in making gun powder (mixture of KNO,, carbon
and sulphur) and other explosives. It is also used as a fertilizer.
Calcium sulphate, (CaSO,-2H,O, Gypsum) is used for plastering walls and
supporting fractured bones.
Barium sulphate, (BaSQ,) is given to patients as a “barium meal” before gastro-
intestinal x-ray photography; it is also used as a white pigment.
Iron (II) sulphate (FeSO) is given as iron tablets to patients who suffer from anaemia.
Properties of salts
Salts can be classified depending on the anion (negative ion) they possess, because
the anion is partly responsible for the solubility of the salt.
1. Solubility of salts. The following table summarizes some simple observations
about the solubility of some groups of salts.

2. Tendency to absorb water from the atmosphere or release water to the
atmosphere.
@ Giemstrycrave10
Depending on their tendency to absorb water from or release water to the
atmosphere, salts can be classified as hygroscopic, deliquescent and
efflorescent.
Hygroscopic salts are those which absorb water from the atmosphere but remain
solid.
Deliquescent salts absorb water from the atmosphere to form a solution. The
process of absorbing water from the atmosphere by a solid to form a solution
is called deliquescence.
Efflorescent salts lose their water of crystallization to the atmosphere. The
loss of water of crystallization by solid crystals to the atmosphere is known as
efflorescence.
It is very important to note that all deliquescent substances are hygroscopic,
but all hygroscopic substances are not necessarily deliquescent.
Table 2.3 Examples of hygroscopic, deliquescent and efflorescent salts.
* Calcium chloride , CaCl, * Anhydrous Copper(Il) * Hydrated sodium

* Sodium Nitrate, NaNO, * Hydratedsodium sulphate,
Na,SO,°10H,O
° lron (Ill) chloride, FeCl,
* Magnesium chloride, MgCl,
¢ Lithium nitrate, LINO,
* Sodium nitrate, NaNO,
3. Aqueous solutions of soluble salts are good conductors of electricity, because
they release mobile positive and negative ions in solution.
Examples
NaNO, (aq) — Na‘(aq) + NO; (aq)
CaCl, (aq) — Ca*(aq) + 2Ch (aq)
4. Thermal stability of salts: When different salts containing the same anion
are heated, they may not show similar behaviour. Some salts are thermally
stable while others undergo decomposition. The following examples illustrate
this fact.
a Thermal decomposition of carbonates:
Carbonates are salts containing a carbonate, as an anion. Carbonates of Group
IIA and most transition metals decompose on heating to give the metal oxides
and carbon dioxide:
MgCo,(s) —tt, Meo) + CO,@)
CuCO, (s) _heat_ Guo (s) + CO, (g)
However, carbonates of sodium and potassium are not decomposed by heat.
b Thermal decomposition of nitrates
Nitrates are salts containing a nitrate, as an anion. Heating nitrates of Group ITA
and most transition metals produces a metal oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen:
Nitrate _ heat, Metal oxide + Nitrogen dioxide + Oxygen
Examples
2Mg(NO,), (s) “> 2MgO(s) + 4NO,(g) + 0,@)
2Pb(NO,), (s) —w#£s 270 (s) + 4NO,(¢) + 0,@)

fertilizers are inorganic salts?
@— cemstrycravE1O
2. Plants need nitrogen for their growth, and there is plenty of nitrogen in the air. If this
is so, why do we apply nitrogeneous fertilizers for plants?
3. Some people prefer to eat organic food that has been grown without fertilizers and
pesticides. Does eating organic food overcome the problems caused by artificial
fertilizers? Discuss in groups and present to the class.
The growth and development of plants is determined by various factors of soil, climate,
and by factors inherent in the plants themselves. Minerals required by plants for their
growth and development are called plant nutrients. For a soil to produce crops
successfully, it must have an adequate supply of all the necessary nutrients that plants
take from the soil. The required nutrient elements must be present in the soil in forms
that plants can use and also there should be a rough balance among them in accordance
with the amounts needed by plants. When any one of these elements is lacking or is in
excess of the required proportion, the normal plant growth will not take place.
Elements required by plants for their growth and development are called essential
nutrients. The elements considered as essential nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, boron,
copper, zinc, molybdenum, cobalt and chlorine. All these seventeen elements have
their own roles in the growth and development of plants. Depending on the amount
required by plants, these elements are classified as macronutrients and micronutrients.
Activity 2.23
Try to identify the (a) micronutrients, (b) macronutrients, required for the growth of wheat,
maize, and rice crops, by consulting the books in your library. Share your findings with the
class.
Macronutrients are the elements required in relatively large amounts by plants. These
are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen.
Micronutrients are the elements required by plants in relatively small (t#7ace) amounts.
These elements are iron, cobalt, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, copper, boron and
chlorine.
The elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by plants from air and water.
These are not considered as mineral nutrients. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium
|IMPORTANTICONUMPOOUNDRS (UGNIT2A) NIC
are said to be primary mineral nutrients. The roles of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
in the plant growth are discussed below:
Nitrogen is a very important plant nutrient. It is absorbed by plants in the form of
nitrate ions (NO,). In the growth and development of plants, nitrogen is utilized in the
synthesis of amino acids, proteins, coenzymes and nucleic acids. The proteins formed
control the metabolic processes that occur in plant cells. Nitrogen is also involved in
the synthesis of chlorophyll to produce a deep green colour.
Phosphorus is an important element without which the growth of plants is impossible.
It facilitates early growth and root formation, quick maturity and promotes seed or
fruit production. Phosphorus is absorbed by plants mainly in the form of H,PO, and
HPO,* in small amounts. Phosphorus has a role in the formation of some amino
acids and proteins, coenzymes, nucleic acids and high energy phosphate compounds
like Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
Potassium is absorbed by plants in the form of the K* ion. It is a component of
enzymes that facilitate the process of photosynthesis and protein synthesis. It also adjusts
stomata movement. It is the most important ion in controlling the turgidity of plant
cells. It increases in the solute potential (sap concentration) within the cells which
leads to an increase in the amount of water that enters the cells osmotically.
Exercise 2.12
1. What is the importance of the following elements for the growth of food crops?
a nitrogen b phosphorus c potassium
2. In what form do plants absorb these elements?
Fertilizers
During the growth and development of plants, the plants consume the essential nutrients
from the soil. The concentration of these nutrients will decrease in the soil. If the
plants are specially food crops, the nutrients can be lost from the soil when the plants
are removed on harvest. So for the soil to be suitable for the growth of plants in the
next round, the nutrients lost must be replaced.
How can we replace the nutrients lost from the soil? How can we increase the
crop producing potential of soils? The nutrients lost from the soil can be replaced or
the crop producing potential of soils can be increased by adding the appropriate fertilizers
to the soil.
@ Giemstrycrave10
What are fertilizers? Fertilizers are materials that are added to soils to increase the
growth, yield or nutrient value of crops. Fertilizers are usually classified as organic
(natural) fertilizers and synthetic or artificial fertilizers.
Organic (natural) fertilizers are those derived from animals and plants. This includes
animal dung, urine and substances obtained from the decay and decomposition of
plants. These fertilizers provide readily available nutrients to plants after some period
of decay and decomposition. These fertilizers can supply the elements nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium and various trace elements to the soil.
Synthetic or artificial fertilizers contain all three major plant nutrients 1.e., nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium, and are known as complete fertilizers.
A mixed artificial fertilizer may contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Such a
type of fertiliser is called a complete fertiliser. The term NPK is used to describe
fertilizers containing the elements nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
Examples of artificial fertilizers are ammonium sulphate, (NH,,),SO,, potassium nitrate
(KNO,), ammonium nitrate (NH,NO,), and diammonium hydrogen phosphate, DAP
((NH,),HPO,).
The most important mineral nutrients that need to be added to the soil are usually
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. All the three elements are needed in large quantities.
Commercial fertilizers are normally given a “grade”, which reflects the percentages
they contain of N, P and K by dry weight. For example, a NPK fertilizer may be
described as 10:10:10 indicating that there is 10% of each element in the fertilizer. The
suitable proportions are best determined in relation to the tested fertility of the soil and
the requirements of the particular crop that is being grown on it. This means fertilizers
of the same composition are not used for different purposes. In nitrogen deficient soil,
a fertilizer containing a higher percentage of nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium
must be used. In addition to this, all fertilizers are not used for treatment of all kinds
of soil. For example, ammonium sulphate is more suitable for use in basic soils than in
acidic or neutral soils.
Exercise 2.13
1. Classify the following as organic or synthetic fertilizers:
a NH,NO, b urea c (NH,),SO,
2. Can the same fertilizer be applied to all types of soil? Explain.
Pesticides
Pesticides are chemicals that can be applied to agricultural crops to kill pests which
affect the growth and development of plants. Parasitic fungi, insects and animals like
rodents, rabbits and birds reduce crop yields or even completely destroy crops.
>
Pesticides are used to overcome the damage caused by fungi and pests. The majority
of the pesticides used in agriculture are organic compounds. However, there are some
inorganic substances that serve as pesticides. These include fumigant insecticides that
exist in the vapour phase. Examples of fumigants are hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sulphur
dioxide (SO,), carbon disulphide (CS,) and phosphine (PH,). These pesticides are
mostly used in the treatment of empty transport containers, grain stores, warehouses,
harvested products prior to or during storage and to destroy pests in the soil. The
other inorganic pesticides are mostly copper compounds such as CuCl,, Cu(OH),,
Cu(NO,),, CuSO,, Cu,O and CuCO,. Among the inorganic compounds, CuSO,
and Cu,O are used as fungicides where as HCN, SO,, PH,, CuCl,, Cu(OH),,
Cu(NO,), and CuCO, are used as insecticides.
Herbicides

Dry cells which we use in portable radios and flashlights are energy converters.
a Peel the external cover of a dry cell battery and observe the components. How many
different components do you see? What are they?
b What type of energy do we get from dry cells? How does the cell generate this

Electrochemistry is a field of chemistry that deals with the relationship between
electrical energy and chemical energy. It is a field of chemistry concerned with
processes that bring about chemical reactions (changes) using electricity or generating
electrical energy from chemical reactions. Thus, electrical energy and chemical energy
are inter-convertible.
The devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy or electrical energy to
chemical energy are called electrochemical cells. These cells can be classified as
electrolytic cells and galvanic or voltaic cells. Electrolytic cells use electrical energy to
bring about chemical changes that produce many desirable substances in our daily
lives. Galvanic or voltaic cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy. The cells
we use in flashlight batteries, wrist watches, cameras and car batteries are examples
of Galvanic cells. The reactions between the chemicals in these cells are responsible
for the generation of electricity.
Electrochemistry has practical applications in our modern world and in everyday life.
Electrolysis is used to manufacture metals like sodium, aluminium; non-metals like
chlorine, hydrogen and compounds like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite.
Electrochemistry also has a role in the production of dry cells and lead storage
batteries used in the automotive industry.

* use conductivity apparatus to test the conductivity of substances.
Why do metals conduct electricity? Do you know any non-metal, which conducts
electricity? Electrical conductivity is the capacity of a substance to transmit electricity.
The materials that allow the passage of electricity through them are called electrical
conductors.
Conductivity apparatus is used to test the conductivity of different solid substances or
that of aqueous solutions of different compounds. The basic components of
conductivity apparatus include electric wires, electrodes, a d.c. source or dry cells, a
switch and light bulb. The components of the apparatus can be connected to one
another as shown in Figure 3.1.

Depending on the nature of the particles responsible for the flow of electric charges
through conductors, electrical conductivity can be classified as metallic conductivity or
electrolytic conductivity.
a) Metallic conductivity

nature as the other conductors of electricity?
Discuss in groups and present it to the class
Why do metals transmit electric current? What are the charge carriers in metals?
Metallic conductivity refers to the transmission of electric current through metals. This
transmission is directly related to the structure of metals. In atoms of metals, the
valence electrons are bounded very loosely to their respective nuclei and move very
easily throughout the metal. This means metals contain electrons that do not have fixed
positions and are relatively free to move. These electrons are called free electrons or
mobile electrons or delocalized electrons. Thus, the structure of the metals can be
regarded as a series of positively charged metal ions, or cations, in a sea of negatively
charged electrons.
Free Electrons Nucleus
Figure 3.2 Electrical conductivity in metals.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3) mm
The electrons entering the metal displace (repel) the freely moving electrons at the
point of entry. The displaced electrons occupy new positions by pushing neighbouring
electrons ahead. This will continue until electrons are forced out of the wire at the
opposite end. So, metallic conductivity is caused by the flow of mobile electrons due
to repulsion exerted on them from the electrons entering the metal from the source of
electricity. The charge carriers in metallic conduction are electrons. Hence, metallic
conductivity is also called electronic conductivity.
Non-metals are generally non-conductors of electricity, because they do not have freely
moving electrons. Graphite is a form of carbon in which the carbon atoms are bonded in
trigonal planar fashion to the three other carbon atoms, to form inter-connected hexagonal
rings, as shown in Figure3.3. Electrons move freely through the hexagonal layers, making
graphite a good conductor of electricity.
Figure 3.3 Structure of graphite (The blue colour is added to emphasize the planarity of the carbon layers.)
b) Electrolytic conductivity
Electrolytes are substances that transmit electricity in a molten state or in aqueous
solution. Based on their degree of ionization or the extent to which they produce
anions and cations, electrolytes can be classified as strong electrolytes or weak
electrolytes. Strong electrolytes ionize almost completely in aqueous solutions. Weak
electrolytes ionize only slightly. When electrical potential is applied through an
electrolyte solution, the positive ions (cations) move in one direction and the negative
ions (anions) move in the opposite direction. This movement of ions through the
electrolyte, brought about by the application of electricity, is called electrolytic
conductivity. Hence, the charge-carriers in electrolytic conductivity are ions (anions
and cations).

The substances that do not transmit electricity either in solution or in a molten state are
called non-electrolytes. Ionic compounds are non-conductors of electricity in the solid
state. This is because their ions are held at fixed positions and cannot move. Other
examples of non-electrolytes include sugar, ethanol, oil, benzene, and liquid nitrogen.

Activity 3.3
Give an opinion on the following questions and present your ideas to the class.
1. How do you identify whether an electrode is a cathode or an anode?
2. Can you suggest why positive and negative ions are named as cations and anions
respectively?
Electrolysis is a process in which electrical energy is used to produce chemical
changes. This process is carried out in an electrochemical cell known as an
electrolytic or electrolysis cell. A typical electrolysis cell contains a source of direct
electric current, an electrolyte and connecting wires that join the source to the
electrodes.
Electrodes are strips of metal or graphite that allow electrons to leave or enter the
electrolytes. They can be chemically active or inert. Active electrodes directly take
part in reactions. Examples include zinc and magnesium. Inert electrodes do not
directly take part in chemical reactions. They only serve to transfer electrons.
Examples include platinum and graphite.
The electrode connected to the positive terminal of the source is positively charged
and is called the anode. It is the electrode through which electrons leave the cell. The
electrode connected to the negative terminal of the source is negatively charged and is
called the cathode. It is the electrode through which electrons enter the cell.
During electrolysis, the ions of the electrolyte migrate to the electrodes of the opposite
charge. The positive ions are attracted to the cathode and are called cations. Since
the cathode has excess electrons, the cations will discharge by gaining electrons. This
process of gaining electrons is called reduction. The negative ions are attracted by the
positive electrode (anode) and are called anions. These ions are discharged by losing
electrons at the anode. This process of losing electrons is called oxidation.
Thus, the cathode is the electrode at which reduction occurs and the anode is the
electrode at which oxidation takes place.
CTCHEMISTRRY UNITS)
The reaction that takes place at each electrode is known as a half-cell reaction. Oxidation
half-reactions occur at the anode and reduction half reaction at the cathode. The net
reaction that takes place in the electrolytic cell is known as a cell reaction. This overall
reaction is also referred to as an oxidation-reduction reaction or redox reaction. So
electrolysis is a process in which electric energy is used to bring about an oxidation-
reduction reaction. It is also defined as the decomposition of an electrolyte, using electricity.
The process of electrolysis includes electrolyzing aqueous solutions of electrolytes.
However, at this level, electrolysis of molten electrolytes will be discussed.
Electrolysis of Molten (Fused) Electrolytes
When ionic solids melt, they dissociates into positive and negative ions that are not
held in fixed positions. To understand the chemical reactions that occur during
electrolysis, consider a hypothetical electrolyte, MX, that dissociate into M* and X~.
Mx melting : Mt 4 xX
During electrolysis, the cations, M* ions, move toward the cathode, gain one electron
each and become M atoms. The anions, X- ions, move toward the anode, lose one
electron and become X atoms. The reaction at each electrode and the entire reaction
in the electrolytic cell are represented by the following equations.
Cathode reaction: M* + le’ > M (Reduction-half reaction)
Anode reac tion: xX> X + le” (Oxidation half-reaction)
Cell reaction: Mt + XS"5M + X (Oxidation-reduction)
Anode (+) Cathode (—)
Electrolyte
Figure 3.5 Electrolysis of fused Electrolyte, MX.
Here, it is very important to realize that the number of electrons gained by the cations
at the cathode is exactly equal to the number of electrons lost by anions at the anode
during electrolysis. This is true for any oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction.
Moreover, oxidation and reduction reactions proceed simultaneously. Reduction and
oxidation cannot occur separately. Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction and
there cannot be reduction in the absence of oxidation, and vice versa.

¢ describe how voltaic cells can be used to make commercially useful batteries;
¢ distinguish between voltaic cell and an electrolytic cell;
¢ describe voltaic cells.
Activity 3.4
Discuss the following and present your ideas to the class:
1. Have you seen the expiry date written on dry cells? Can we get the expected amount
of electric energy after the expiry date of the cell; why?
2. Do we throw away car batteries when they fail to generate electricity? Explain.
3. Galvanic cells available in the market have positive and negative terminals. Does this
show that they also possess an anode and cathode?
In the previous section, electrolytic cells were defined as electrochemical cells in which
electricity was used to bring about chemical reactions. The chemical reaction in an
electrolytic cell is caused by electricity and is a non-spontaneous redox reaction. This
means the reaction can proceed only in the presence of electricity. If we stop passing
electricity through the electrolyte, the reaction will stop.
In a Galvanic cell, the reaction that occurs inside the cell is a spontaneous redox
reaction. The reaction that occurs inside the cell will proceed on its own without any
171
@&— cHemistryeraveto
external influence. This reaction enables a galvanic cell to generate electricity.
Therefore, Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox
reactions generate electricity. They convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Galvanic or voltaic cells are classified into primary cells, secondary cells, and fuel
cells. For this level, only primary and secondary cells will be discussed.
Primary Cells
Primary galvanic cells are those cells that are not rechargeable. This is because the
electrode reaction as well as the entire cell reaction cannot be reversed on recharging.
Once the chemicals in the cells that serve as reactants are completely used up, it is
not possible to recover them by charging the cells. Examples of primary cells include
Daniel’s cell and zinc-carbon (Leclanche) dry cells. The common feature of all
Galvanic cells is that they contain two electrodes in contact with an electrolyte. The
electrolyte in a Galvanic cell can be in the form of a solution or a paste. The cells
containing electrolytes in the form of solution are called wet cells, and those containing
electrolytes in the form of paste are called dry cells.
An example of a wet primary cell is the Daniell cell. It consists of a zinc strip placed
in ZnSO, solution in one compartment and a copper strip placed in copper sulphate,
CuSO,, solution in another compartment. Each compartment is called a half-cell, and
the reactions occurring in each compartment are called half-cell reactions. The
solutions in the two compartments are linked by a salt bridge as shown in Figure 3.7.
The salt bridge consists of a delivery tube filled with warm mixture of conc. KCl
solution and agar solution, which is then allowed to cool so that it sets in the form of
a gel.
Alternately, a porous barrier is used to separate the solutions. The zinc atoms from the
zinc electrode lose two electrons each and become zinc ions, Zn**. The ions enter
into the solution, and the electrons remain on the electrode and flow through the
external wire to the copper electrode. This situation causes the zinc electrode to be
negative and the solution to have an overall positive charge.
On the other hand, in the compartment containing the copper electrode, copper ions,
Cu’, from the solution move to the cathode and gain two electrons each, to become
copper atoms and deposit on the surface of the copper electrode. This condition
causes the electrode to be positive and the solution to have a negative charge.

Figure 3.7 The Daniell Cell.
Note that the anode is the negative electrode and the cathode is the positive electrode
in galvanic cells, as opposed to the situation in an electrolytic cell. But, it is always
oxidation that occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode.
The half-cell reactions and the cell reaction in Daniell cells are represented as
Anode reaction: Zn (s) — Zn** (aq) + 2e7
Cathode reaction: Cu** (aq) + 2e7 > Cu (s)
Cell reaction: Zn (s) + Cu** (aq) — Zn?* (aq) + Cu (s)
Due to the oxidation-reduction reaction in the cell, the Daniell cell generates electricity.
What is the purpose of the salt bridge in Figure 3.7?
From the preceding discussion, it is clear that the solution in which the zinc electrode
is placed has an overall positive charge while the solution in the copper compartment
has a negative charge. Unless the two solutions are neutral, the cell cannot produce
electricity. Thus, the purpose of the salt bridge is to:
a maintain electrical neutrality between the two solutions. In this process the anions
(negative ions) from the salt bridge diffuse into the solution containing the zinc
electrodes, and the cations (positive ions) diffuse into the solution containing
the copper electrode to compensate for the excess positive and negative charges,
respectively;
b__ allow electrical contact between the two solutions;
¢ prevent mixing of the electrode solutions.
Although, wet cells like the Daniell cell can serve as a source of electricity, they are
not portable since they contain solutions. Due to this practical problem of using wet
cells, dry cells were developed.
In a dry cell, a moist electrolyte paste is used instead of solutions. This cell was
invented by Georges Leclanche, a French chemist.
A zinc-carbon dry cell, which is also called a Leclanche cell (Figure 3.8) is used in
devices like portable radios and flashlights. The cell consists of a zinc cup that serves
as the anode. The zinc cup is filled with a paste of manganese (IV) oxide, zinc
chloride, ammonium chloride and powdered carbon. A graphite rod, immersed in this
paste, serves as the cathode.

Secondary Cells
Unlike primary cells, secondary cells are rechargeable. The electrode reactions can be
reversed, and the original reactants can be regenerated. This can be achieved by passing
a direct current through the cell. The process is called charging or recharging.
A secondary cell needs to be recharged when it stops producing electricity. A lead
storage battery is an example of a secondary cell.
A lead Storage Battery is the common automobile battery that usually delivers either 6
or 12 volts, depending on the number of cells used in its construction. The inside of
the battery consists of galvanic cells connected in series. A fully-charged lead-acid cell
is made up of a stack of alternating lead and lead (IV) oxide plates isolated from each
other by porous separators. The individual cells contain a number of lead anodes
connected together, plus a number of cathodes composed of PbO,, also joined
together. These electrodes are immersed in 35% sulphuric acid, which serves as an
electrolyte.
A single lead-storage cell delivers 2 volts. Therefore, a 12 V battery contains six cells
connected in series.

Figure 3.9 Lead - Storage Battery.
When a lead-storage battery is in operation (on discharge), the following reactions
occur at the electrodes:
Anode reactions: Pb (s) + SO% (aq) — PbSO, (s) + 2e
Cathode reactions: PbO, (s) + 4H* (aq) + SO7 (aq) + 2e” > PbSO, (s) + 2H,O (1)
and the overall reaction is:
Pb (s) + PbO, (s) + 4H* (aq) 2SO7 (aq) > 2PbSO, (s) + 2H,O (I)
From the electrode reactions it can be noticed that PbSO, is produced at both
electrodes.
Unlike primary cells a lead-storage battery is rechargeable when the battery runs
down. The electrode reactions can be reversed by placing a potential across the
electrodes that is slightly larger than that which the battery can deliver. The reaction
that takes place on recharging a lead storage battery is given by the following
equation.
2PbSO, (s) + 2H,O (1) > Pb (s) + PbO, (s) + 2H,SO, (aq)

Each day, our lives are touched directly or indirectly by the products of electrolysis.
Electrolysis has important industrial applications. It is used for:
a) The production of chemicals like sodium hydroxide, from
electrolysis of brine (concentrated NaCl solution), using
inert electrodes.
The reactions that take place at the electrodes (when graphite electrodes are used)
are as follows:
Anode reaction: 2CI (aq) — Cl, (g) + 2e
Cathode reaction: 2H,O (1) + 2e° — H, (g) + 20H (aq)
The overall cell reaction is:
2NaCl (aq) + 2H,O (1) > 2Na* (aq) + 2OHTM- (aq) + Cl, (g) + H, (g)
178
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3) >
b) For the production of metals and non-metals.
The non-metals like H,, Cl,, F, etc are manufactured on an industrial scale by the
process called electrolysis. The metal aluminium is extracted industrially by the Hall
Process. This process involves the electrolysis of molten alumina (Al,O,) mixed with
some amount of cryolite, Na,AIF,. The role of cryolite is to reduce the melting point
of alumina from 2000°C to 1000°C. The vessel holding the molten mixture
(Figure 3.8) is made up of iron lined with carbon, which serves as the cathode.
Carbon (graphite) rods that serve as the anode are inserted into the melt. When the
molten mixture is electrolyzed, pure aluminium is produced. The reactions at the
electrodes are:
Anode reaction: 607 (1) — 30, (g) + 12e€
Cathode reaction: 4Al(*1) + 12e — 4Al(l)
Overall reaction: 4Al*(1) + 607(1) > 30,(g) + 4Al()

a_ Explain why this is so.
b Does this process mean wastage of time, labour and energy? Why? Discuss in groups
and present your opinion o the rest of the class.
&— cemistaycrapeno
Another important application of electrolysis is the purification of metals like copper.
When first separated from its ore, copper metal is about 99% pure with nickel, silver,
gold and platinum as major impurities. In the refining process, the impure copper is
used as the anode, copper metal of high purity used as cathode, and copper sulphate,
CuSO, solution and aqueous H,SO, as the electrolyte.
When electrolysis is carried out, copper and impurities that are more easily oxidized
than copper, such as nickel, will go into the solution. Copper passes through the
solution and deposits on the cathode, while the impurities remain in solution. Impurities
like silver and gold are less easily oxidized and do not dissolve but fall away from the
anode as ‘sludge’. The electrode reaction in the purification of copper is the following:
Anode reaction: Cu(s) > Cu**(aq)+2e
Cathode reaction: Cu**(aq)+2e — Cu(s)
During the process, the size of the impure copper anode decreases and that of the
pure copper cathode increases.

Always remember that, in the purification of metals by electrolysis, the impure metal
should be used as the anode, the pure form of the metal as the cathode and an
electrolyte should contain soluble salt (ions) of the metal to be purified. The process
of purifying metals by electrolysis is called electrorefining.

d) Electroplating
Activity 3.8
When zinc electrode is dipped in copper sulphate solution, part of the electrode in the
solution will be covered with a reddish brown layer of copper. Can this process be
considered as electroplating? Explain. Discuss in groups and present your opinion to the
class.
What is the purpose of electroplating?
Electroplating is a process of covering the surface of a metal (metal article) with a
thin layer of another metal. Using this process, metals that easily corrode can be
protected by a thin coating of another metal that resists corrosion. For example, tin
cans are steel cans with a thin coating of tin, and chrome-plated bumpers are used for
automobiles. Thus, the main objective of electroplating is to protect an article from
corrosion and to give articles a beautiful appearance. In the process of electroplating,
the pure plating metal should be used as the anode, the article (metal) to be plated
the as cathode and a solution containing ions of the plating metal as the electrolyte.
For example, to produce a silver-plated copper article, say, a medal, one should
use silver as the anode, the copper medal as the cathode and silver nitrate solution as
the electrolyte (Figure 3.12).

Natural resources can be classified as renewable and non-renewable resources. Renewable
resources are resources that can be replenished (replaced) by natural processes. These
resources can be renewed at the same rate at which they are used. Plants, animals, soil and
water are examples of renewable resources. Non-renewable resources are resources that
are found in a fixed amount in nature and cannot be replenished. These resources can be
completely used up within some decades and cannot be replaced easily. Examples of non-
renewable resources include natural gas, and coal. Generally, any chemical industry utilizes
either natural resource as starting materials, or other substances obtained from natural resources

A. Aluminium
Occurrence and extraction
Aluminium is the most abundant metal and the third most plentiful element after oxygen and
silicon in the earth’s crust. About seven percent of the earth’s crust is aluminium. It is the
second-most important metal, after iron, in terms of consumption. Aluminium does not
occur as a free metal in nature. Its principal ore is bauxite (Al,O,-2H,O). Other minerals
containing aluminium are orthoclase (KAISi,O,), cryolite (Na, AIF), corundum (AL O,),
beryl (Be,ALSi,O,) and china clay (AI,S1,0,-2H,O).
Aluminium is extracted industrially principally, from bauxite, Al,O,*2H,O, by the Hall—
Héroult process or simply the Hall process. In this process, first the bauxite needs to be
purified since it is frequently contaminated with silica (SiO.), iron oxides and titanium (IV)
oxide. To isolate pure Al O, from bauxite, the powdered ore is first heated with sodium
hydroxide solution to convert silica into a soluble silicate.
SiO,(s) + 2NaOH(aq) — _ Na,SiO,(aq) + H,O()
At the same time aluminium oxide is converted to soluble sodium aluminate.
ALO,(s) + 2NaOH(aq) — _ NaAlO,(aq) + HO)
The impurities like iron oxides and titanium (IV) oxide remain unaffected by the base and
are filtered off. Why are they not affected?
Then the solution is treated with acid to precipitate aluminium hydroxide.
AlO, (aq) + H,O*(aq) —> AI(OH),(s)
Aluminium hydroxide is collected by filtration, washed, dried, and then heated strongly in
a furnace to get ALO,,.
2A(OH), —, alo, + 3H,0
Pure aluminium oxide is mixed with some cryolite, Na, AIF’, and then melted. Cryolite is
added to AIO, to reduce its melting point from 2045°C to 1000°C. The molten mixture is
then electrolyzed to obtain aluminium. The electrolytic cell, in which the molten mass is
electrolyzed, contains graphite electrodes as both anode and cathode.
1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the dissociation of aluminium oxide in the
molten state.
2. Identify the ions that move to the cathode and the anode during the electrolysis of
molten aluminium oxide? Write the half-reactions at the anode, cathode and overall
cell reactions.

ALO, is converted to Al, by electrolysis. We do not use reducing agents for reduction
of aluminium from aluminium oxide; why?
Physical Properties: Aluminium 1s a soft silvery-white metal having a density of 2.7
g/cm’. It melts at 660°C. It can be shaped into wires, rolled, pressed or cast into different
shapes. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity.
Chemical Properties: Aluminium is a reactive metal, even though its reactions are not
vigorous in comparison with those of sodium, potassium, calcium and other metals of
group IA and ITA. It undergoes the following reactions:
a Reaction with Oxygen:
Aluminium has affinity for oxygen and reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin
film of aluminium oxide on its surface.
4Al(s) + 30,(2) > 2AL,0,()
— @&— cemisraycrapeno
This thin film of oxide inhibits further reaction with oxygen. The thin film can be
removed by rubbing with mercury or mercury (II) chloride solution.
What type of oxide is Al,O,?
b Reaction with dilute acids:
Aluminium reacts with dilute acids like HCl and H,SO,, forming salts and liberating
hydrogen gas.
2Al(s) + 3H,SO,(aq) — AL(SO,),(aq) + 3H,(g)
2Al(s) + 6HCI (aq) —> 2AICL,(s) + 3H,(g)
Aluminium does not react with dilute or concentrated HNO, due to the formation of
a protective oxide layer on its surface.
c Aluminium burns in chlorine gas to form aluminium chloride:
2Al(s) + 3CL(g) > 2AlCL,(s)
ad Aluminium reacts with sodium hydroxide solution:
2Al(s) + 2NaOH (aq) + 6H,O(J) — 2NaAl(OH),(aq) + 3H,(g)
Uses: Aluminium is lightweight and corrosion resistant, so it is used to make light alloys
like duralumin (mixture ofAl, Cu and Mg). Alloys of aluminium are extensively used in the
transport industry to make aircraft, ships and cars. It is used in the manufacture of household
cooking utensils due to its high thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. It is also
used to make door and window frames and roofing for buildings, as packaging material in
food industries, and for electrical transmission lines.
In the thermite welding process, powdered aluminium when mixed with iron (IIT) oxide
and ignited, produces a temperature of about 3000°C. This temperature is quite sufficient
for welding metals. The reaction in this process is as follows:
2Al(s) + FeO,(s) — 2Fe(l) + ALO,(s)
The mixture of powdered aluminium and iron oxide is called thermite.

Discuss in groups and give a presentation to the class.
B. Iron
Occurrence and Extraction
Iron is the second-most abundant metal next to aluminium, in the earth’s crust and it is the
fourth most abundant element. It constitutes about 4.7% of the earth’s crust by weight. It
is never found as a free metal in nature. It occurs in nature only in the form of compounds,
such as oxides, carbonates and sulphides. The chief ores of iron are hematite (Fe,O,),
limonite (Fe,O,-H,O), magnetite (Fe,O,,), and siderite (FeCO,). It is also found in the
form of iron pyrites (FeS,) which is commonly called fool’s gold.
Iron is generally extracted from hematite (Fe,O,), magnetite (Fe,O,,) and siderite (FeCO,).
The extraction of iron from its ores is carried out in a blast furnace. The raw materials for
the extraction of iron are iron ore, coke, limestone and hot air. The furnace is charged with
amixture of iron ore, limestone and coke at the top and a blast of hot air is blown in at the
bottom. The coke burns to form carbon dioxide and the temperature approaches 2000°C
near the bottom. As the carbon dioxide rises up, the coke reduces it to carbon monoxide.
The carbon monoxide then reduces the iron oxide to iron metal. The overall reactions in
the blast furnace can be summarized as follows:
1. Oxidation of coke to carbon dioxide:

The iron obtained directly from the blast furnace is called pig iron. It is impure and contains
about 2% silicon, up to 1% phosphorus and manganese, and traces of sulphur. These
impurities make pig iron brittle. When pig iron is re-melted with scrap iron and cast into
moulds, it forms cast iron.
Wrought iron: is the purest form of commercial iron. It is obtained by removing most of
the impurities from pig iron. It is manufactured by heating impure iron with hematite and
limestone in a furnace. This increases the purity of the iron to 99.5%. Wrought iron is a
tough, malleable and ductile form of iron.
PROJECT 4.1
Form a group and construct a model of the blast furnace from locally available
materials.
Conversion of Pig Iron to Steel
The relatively high carbon-content of the iron recovered from the blast furnace (pig iron)
makes it very hard and brittle. The conversion of pig iron to steel 1s essentially a purification
process in which impurities are removed by oxidation. This purification process is carried
out in a furnace at high temperatures. In the conversion of pig iron to steel, three different
methods are used. These are the Bessemer Converter, Open-hearth Furnace and the
Basic Oxygen Process.
a The Bessemer Converter: In the process of converting pig iron to steel, molten
pig iron from the blast furnace is transferred to a cylindrical vessel containing a
refractory lining of MgCO, and CaCO,,. A blast of hot air is blown through the
molten metal from a set of small holes at the bottom of the vessel. The oxygen
passing through the molten metal converts silicon, phosphorus and sulphur to their
oxides, which then react with the lining to form aslag. The carbon in the pig iron is
also oxidized to carbon monoxide, so its concentration is also reduced. The
conversion of the pig iron to steel by this process requires only 15 minutes. However,
the reaction 1s difficult to control and the quality of the steel produced can be quite
variable.
b The Open-hearth Furnace: It has a large, shallow hearth, which is usually lined
with a basic oxide refractory (MgO and CaO). The furnace is charged with a mixture
of pig iron, Fe,O,, scrap iron and limestone. A blast of hot air and burning fuel is
directed over the surface of the charge to maintain it in the molten state. Impurities in
the pig iron are oxidized by the Fe,O, and air. Carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide
formed by the oxidation of the carbon and sulphur, respectively, in the pig iron
bubble out of the mixture as waste gases.
197
— @&— cemisavcrapeno
The SiO, and other acidic oxides like P,O,,, combine with CaO (from limestone) and the
refractory lining to form aslag.
The impurities in pig iron are oxidized in the following way:
Cc 6+ (OO, > CO,
S + O, > So,
12P + 10Fe,0, > 3P,0, + 20Fe
3Si + 2Fe0, > 3810, + 4Fe
Calcium oxide, formed by the decomposition of limestone, reacts with oxides of silicon
and phosphorus to form slag.
PO, + 6Ca0 > 2Ca(PO,),
4~ 10
SiO, + CaO > CaSiO,
This entire process takes 8 to 10 hours to complete and the quality of the steel is much
more easily controlled. A calculated amount of various elements can be added to the steel
to form steel alloys with desired properties.

| CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT4)
¢c Basic Oxygen Process: This newer procedure has largely replaced the open
hearth, because of its high speed. It involves forcing a mixture of powdered
calcium oxide, CaO, and oxygen gas directly into the surface of the molten
pig iron. The oxygen reacts exothermically with carbon, sulphur, silicon,
phosphorus and impurity metals. Carbon and sulphur are oxidized to CO, and
SO,, respectively, and are released as exhaust gases. The oxides of silicon
(SiO,), phosphorus, (P,O,,) and impurity metals combine with lime (CaO),
forming slag. The charge in the converter is maintained in the molten state by
the energy released in these oxidation reactions. The converter is tilted to
remove the slag. After a second blow of oxygen, the converter is tilted once
again and the molten steel is poured out. This process takes only about 20
to 25 minutes.

Physical Properties of Iron
Do you remember physical properties of iron? Can you mention some of them?
Iron is a grey, lustrous, malleable and ductile metal. It is a good conductor of heat and
electricity. It has a high melting point (1580°C) and a high density (7.87 g/cm’). It is a
ferromagnetic metal, which means it can be permanently magnetized.
Chemical Properties of Tron
Have you ever noticed the formation of a reddish thin film on the surface of an
iron object? Do you know the chemical nature of this thin film? From your
observations, what do you conclude about the reactivity of iron?
Iron is areactive metal. Its reactivity is very slow, compared to group IA and IIA metals.
Iron rusts in the presence of air and moisture to form hydrated iron (II) oxide.
AFe(s) + 30, (g) moisture y 2Fe,O, .x H,O(s) (rust)
Iron reacts with dilute acids, like HCI and H,SO,, forming iron (II) salts and liberating
hydrogen gas.
Fe (s) + 2HCl(aq) —- FeCl, (aq) + H,(g)
Fe (s) + H,SO,(aq) — FeSO, (aq) + H,(g)
Like other transition metals, iron also exhibits different oxidation states. It commonly exists
as the ferrous (Fe?") and ferric (Fe**) ions. Iron (ID) and iron (IID) compounds are coloured.
Aqueous solutions of iron (II) compounds are pale-green and solutions of iron (III)
compounds are yellowish brown.
Aqueous solutions of some iron (II) compounds are rapidly oxidized to the corresponding
iron (IIT) compounds. For example, iron (II) hydroxide, Fe(OH),, on exposure to air,
oxidizes to iron (IIT) hydroxide.
4Fe(OH),(s) = + O,(g) + 2H,O(l) 4 4Fe(OH),(s)
Heated iron reacts with hydrogen chloride gas, forming iron (IT) chloride and hydrogen gas.

Heated iron reacts with chlorine and sulphur to form the chloride and sulphide, respectively.
2Fe(s) + 3CL (g) > 2FeCl, (Ss)
Fe (s) + S (s) > FeS (s)
| CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNTT4)
Iron has the ability to displace less active metals from solutions of their salts. For example,
when a piece of iron is placed in a solution of CuSO,, it is oxidized to Fe** and a reddish
brown deposit of copper metal forms on the surface of the iron.
Fe(s) + Cu’*(aq) > Fe* (aq) + Cu(s)
Uses of Iron
Iron is the most widely used metal and takes first position in worldwide consumption. It is
used as a structural metal in the construction of buildings and bridges. In the form of pig
iron, itis used to make domestic boilers, hot-water radiators, railings, water pipes, castings,
and mouldings. As wrought iron, it is used in making nails, sheets, horseshoes, ornamental
gates, door knockers, farm machinery etc. [ron is also used in the manufacture of alloys
such as carbon steels and alloy steels. Carbon steels can be classified as mild steel, medium
steel and high-carbon steel, based on the amount of carbon.
Mild Steel: contains up to 0.2% carbon and is used in making screws, motors, car batteries,
railway lines, ships, bridges, nuts and bolts.
Medium Steel: contains 0.3—0.6% carbon and is used to make springs and chains.
High-Carbon Steel: contains 0.6—1.5% carbon and is used to make drill bits, knives,
hammers and chisels.
Alloy Steel: contains iron and a relatively higher percentage of other metals. For example,
stainless steel contains chromium (14—18%) and nickel (7-9%). Tool steels include tungsten
steel and manganese steel. These metals give the alloy hardness, toughness and heat
resistance. They are used in rock drills, cutting edges and parts of machinery that are
subjected to heavy wear.

the electrolytic process used for the purification copper metal.
2. Prepare a list of items made of copper.
3. In the refining process of copper, zinc does not deposit on the cathode. Why?
Discuss in your group and give a presentation to the class.
Occurrence and extraction
Copper is occasionally found as native copper. However, it is found mainly in compounds
such as sulphides, oxides and the carbonates. The most important sulphide ores are
chalcopyrite (CuFeS,), chalcocite (Cu,S), covellite (CuS) and bornite (Cu.FeS,). The
principal oxide ores are cuprite (Cu,O) and tenorite (CuO). In the carbonate form, it
exists as malachite (CuCO,-Cu(OH),).
Copper is principally extracted from chalcopyrite. Since the amount of copper in the ore is
very small, the crushed and ground sulphide ore is first concentrated by froth flotation. This
treatment changes the concentration of the ore from 2 % copper to as high as 30% copper.
The concentrated ore is then roasted with a limited supply of air (oxygen).
2CuFeS,(s) + 40,(g) — Cu,S(s) + 2FeO(s) + 3S0,(g)
The roasted mixture is smelted by adding limestone and sand to form a molten slag that
removes many of the impurities. FeO present in the roasted mixture can also be removed
as slag in the form ofiron silicate (FeSiO,), and silica in the form of calcium silicate (CaSiO,).
CaCO,(s) + SiO,(s) —- CaSiO, (I) + CO,(g)
FeO (s) + $10,(s) — FeSiO,(1)
The Cu,S obtained by roasting chalcopyrite is then reduced by heating it in a limited supply
of oxygen.
Cu,S (s) + Og) > 2Cu(l) + SO,(g)
The copper produced by the above process is called blister copper and it has 98.5 — 99.5
% purity. Blister copper contains iron, silver, gold and sometimes zinc as impurities. So it is
refined further by electrolysis as shown in Figure 4.5. Copper obtained by electrolytic
refining is 99.99% pure.

Physical Properties of Copper
Copper is a soft, ductile, malleable, reddish-brown metal with a density of 8.96 g/cm’. It
is second to silver in electrical conductivity. It melts at 1086°C and boils at 2310°C.
Chemical properties of copper
Copper is less reactive metal, that is why it is found in the native state. Although it is not
very reactive, it undergoes the following reactions:
Powdered copper, when heated in air forms a black powder of copper (IT) oxide, CuO.
2Cu(s) + O,(g) — 2CuO(s)
Copper does not react with dilute acids like HCI and H,SO., It cannot displace hydrogen
from acids. However, it can be oxidized by oxidizing acids such as dilute and concentrated
nitric acid and hot concentrated sulphuric acid, H,SO.,.

Cu(s) + 2H,SO,(aq) _Hetand concentrated_, CySO, (ag) + 280,(g) + 2H,O (I)
Copper corrodes in moist air over a long period of time as a result of oxidation caused by
a mixture of water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. It turns green, due to the formation of
verdigris: a basic copper carbonate (CuCO,-Cu(OH),) or Cu,(OH),CO,,.
2Cu(s) + H,OQG) + O,(g) + CO,(g) — CuCO,-Cu(OH),
Basic copper carbonate is responsible for the green layer that forms on the surface of
copper and bronze objects. This layer adheres to the surface and protects the metal from
further corrosion.
Copper is a transition metal and exhibits different oxidation states. It exists as cuprous
(Cu’*) and cupric (Cu**) ions. Compounds containing copper in the +1 oxidation state are
stable in insoluble compounds. Cu'* is unstable and cannot exist in aqueous solution since
itreduces and oxidizes (disproportionates) itself as follows:
2Cu* (aq) — Cu**(aq) + Cu(s)
Soluble compounds containing Cu*, such as CuCl, Cul and CuBr, are all colourless solids.
The most stable oxidation state of copper is +2. Aqueous solutions of many copper (ID)
compounds are blue, thus copper forms coloured compounds in the oxidation state of +2.
For example, hydrated copper sulphate, CuSO,-5H,O, consists of blue crystals, and its
aqueous solution is also blue.
@ cemisravcrapeno
Uses of Copper
Copper is used to manufacture alloys. For example, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin,
and it is used to make coins, medals, bells, machinery parts, etc. Brass is an alloy of
copper and zinc, and it is used for hardware tops, terminals and pipes. Copper is widely
used in the electrical industry in the form of electric wires, cables etc. Copper compounds,
such as copper chloride, copper carbonate and copper hydroxide, are used as pesticides.

1. Draw the structure of a nitrogen molecule. How many bonds are present in it? Why
does nitrogen form triple bond?
2. Which form of nitrogen is absorbed by green plants?
Discuss in group and give a presentation to the class.
Occurrence and Production
Nitrogen occurs in nature in the elemental form. It also exists in the form of compounds. In
the elemental state, it exists as a diatomic molecule, N,, in atmospheric air. It constitutes
about 80% by volume of the atmosphere. In the form of compounds, it exists as sodium
nitrate (Chile salt peter, NaNO,) and potassium nitrate (KNO,) also called saltpetre. It is
also found in DNA molecules and proteins of all living things.
In the industrial production of nitrogen, the first step is to remove impurities like dust and
other particles from air. The air is then compressed under high pressure and low temperature
to remove carbon dioxide and water vapour since they solidify at a relatively high
| CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT4)
temperatures compared to nitrogen and oxygen. As the temperature continues to decrease,
the air containing mainly nitrogen and oxygen condenses to give a pale-blue liquid. Nitrogen
is thus separated on an industrial scale by fractional distillation of liquid air. When liquid air
is fractionally distilled, nitrogen is collected and stored in steel cylinders under pressure.
The second fraction consists of argon, which distils off the mixture at —186°C, leaving
behind a blue liquid of oxygen that boils at—183°C.
In the laboratory, nitrogen is prepared by warming an aqueous solution containing ammonium
chloride and sodium nitrite.
NH,Cl (aq) + NaNO,(aq) — NaCl(aq) + N,(g) + 2H,O (1)
Physical Properties of Nitrogen
Nitrogen is colourless, odourless and tasteless gas. It is inert under ordinary conditions, and
that is why it is found in atmospheric air as N,. The inertness of nitrogen at low temperatures
is directly related to the strength of the triple bond, which requires high energy to break.
Chemical Properties of Nitrogen
Is nitrogen a reactive or unreactive non-metal? Can you suggest a prooffor your
answer?
However, nitrogen reacts with metals of group IA and ITA as well as oxygen at higher
temperatures. When heated with reactive metals like lithium, calcium and magnesium, it
forms compounds, known as nitrides.

2NO(g) + O,(g) — 2NO,(g)
This reddish brown gas dimerizes at low temperatures to give acolourless gas of dinitrogen

Nitrogen also forms oxides, like dinitrogen monoxide, N,O, (commonly called laughing
gas), dinitrogen trioxide (N,O,) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N,O,).
Nitrogen reacts directly with hydrogen in the Haber process to form ammonia. In this
process, a mixture of N, and H, gas, at a pressure of 200-300 atm and a temperature of
400-600°C, is passed over a catalyst of finely divided iron.

in the production of semiconductors. Liquid nitrogen is used as arefrigerant to preserve
bulls’ semen and blood. Its major use is in the production of ammonia.

B. Phosphorus
Occurrence and Extraction
Does phosphorus exist in the pure form (elemental state) as does nitrogen? If not,
why? Phosphorus is a relatively abundant element, ranking 12th in the earth’s crust. It
exists naturally only in the combined state, such as in rock phosphate, Ca,(PO,).,
fluoroapatite, Ca,,(PO,).F, or 3Ca,(PO,),.CaF,. It is also found in teeth, bones and
DNA.
What is allotropy? What are the two common allotropes ofphosphorus?
Allotropes are different forms of the same element with the same physical state but with
different physical properties. This is due to the difference in the arrangement of atoms.
The two common allotropic forms of phosphorus are white phosphorus and red phosphorus.
White phosphorus 1s a very poisonous, white waxy-looking substance that melts at 44.1°C
and boils at 287°C. Its density is 1.8 g/cm’. It consists of individual tetra-atomic (P,)
molecules and is an unstable form of phosphorus.
| CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT4)
Red phosphorus is denser (2.16 g/cm*) and is much less reactive than white phosphorus at
normal temperatures. It consists of P, molecules linked together to form a polymer (/arge
molecule) as shown below.
JN, AN ZN ZN
WY OINIY NIA ON
White phosphorus Red chosphorus
Industrially, white phosphorus is manufactured by heating a mixture of crushed rock
phosphate, Ca,(PO,),, silica, SiO,, and coke in an electric furnace. The reaction in the
furnace is:
2Ca,(PO,),(s) + 6SiO,(s) + 10C(s) + 6CaSiO,(I) + P,(g) + 10CO(g)
The vaporized phosphorus (P.,) is condensed, collected and stored under water. Red
phosphorus 1s prepared by heating white phosphorus in sunlight for several days. White
phosphorus is stored under water because it spontaneously ignites (bursts into flames) in
the presence of oxygen. Red phosphorus is much less reactive than white phosphorus and
does not need to be stored under water.

Cc. Oxygen
Occurrence and Production
Oxygen is the most abundant element on earth. It constitutes about 46.6% by weight of the
earth’s crust in the form of compounds such as oxides, silicates, carbonates, phosphates
etc. It exists in nature in the elemental state in atmospheric air constituting about 20% by
volume. Oxygen is manufactured industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air ina
way similar to that of nitrogen.
Chemical Properties of Oxygen
Oxygen is relatively reactive and combines directly with most elements to form oxides.
Oxygen combines with metal to form metal oxides (basic oxides). For example,
2Mg(s) + O,(g) 7 2MgO(s)
2Ca(s) + O,(8) — ~ 2CaO (s)

Occurrence and Extraction
Sulphur is found in nature and in the form of compounds such as galena (PbS), pyrites
(FeS,) (fool's gold ), cinnabar (HgS), sphalerite (ZnS), gypsum (CaSO,-2H,O), barite
(BaSO,), and as hydrogen sulphide (H,S) in natural gas and crude oil.
Sulphur is extracted from underground deposits of elemental sulphur by the Frasch process
(Figure 4.6). In this process, three concentric pipes are sent down to the sulphur deposit.
Superheated water at about 170°C is pumped through the outermost pipes. Hot air is
compressed in the innermost tube. A froth of sulphur, air and water come out to the surface
of the earth forced by hot compressed air in the middle tube. The molten sulphur is then
cooled and solidified.

@ ciemistrycrave10
Uses: Nearly one-half of the sulphur needed by chemical industries is obtained as a waste
product of other industrial processes. For example, sulphur can be obtained in the form of
hydrogen sulphide (HS) from natural gas and during the purification of crude oil. It can
also be obtained in the form of sulphur dioxide from the roasting of sulphide ores during the
manufacture of metals. The use of sulphur obtained from waste products of other industries
reduces the demand for the element from natural deposits. This also reduces the pollution
of atmospheric air and the formation of acid rain.
Sulphur exhibits allotropy. The most important allotropes of sulphur are rhombic and
monoclinic sulphur. Rhombic sulphur is the most stable form of sulphur consisting of S,
molecules.
Chemical Properties of Sulphur
Sulphur is relatively stable and unreactive at room temperature. However, it reacts with
metals and non-metals when heated.
Sulphur combines with metals when heated to form sulphides.

Sulphur is the raw material for the production of sulphuric acid (H,SO,) by the Contact
Process. This process of sulphuric acid production involves the following steps.
Step 1: Sulphur is first oxidized to produce sulphur dioxide:

2. What is the purpose of adding chlorine to drinking water?
Occurrence and Extraction
Chlorine belongs to group VIIA, known as the halogens. It is the most abundant element
among the halogens. It is found in nature in the form of compounds only. Chlorine is found
in nature chiefly in the form of chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.
Sodium chloride is the chief source of chlorine, and it is obtained from seawater or as
deposits of rock salt.
Commercially, chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis ofa concentrated aqueous solution
of sodium chloride. During electrolysis of the concentrated solution, chlorine is formed at
the anode and the reduction of water occurs at the cathode, producing hydrogen gas and
hydroxide ions (OH). The electrode and the overall cell reactions are as follows:
Oxidation at anode: = 2CI (aq) — Cl, (g) + 2e°
Reduction at cathode: 2H,O (1) + 2e° — H, (g) + 2OH (aq)
Cell reaction: 2NaCl (aq) + 2H,O (1) — 2NaOH (aq) + CL, (g) + H, (g)
Although NaOH forms at the cathode compartment and C1, at the anode, the two substances
must be kept apart from one another. This is because, ifthey come into contact with each
other, they can react according to the following equation.

Chemical Properties of Chlorine
Chlorine is ahighly reactive non-metal. It reacts directly with almost all elements except
the noble gases, carbon and nitrogen. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and oxidizes most of
the elements with which it reacts. The following are the main reactions of chlorine.
Chlorine reacts with heated metals to form chloride salts
2Fe(s) + 3CL(g) — — 2FeCl,(s)
2Al(s) + 3CL(g) — — 2AlCI,(s)
Chlorine reacts smoothly with hydrogen, in the presence of a charcoal as a catalyst, at
room temperature to form hydrogen chloride.
H, (g) + CL(g) — 2HCI(g)
Chlorine displaces less reactive halogens (Br, and I,) from aqueous solutions of their
compounds.
CL(g) + 2KBr(aq)— 2KCI (aq) + Br, (1)
Cl,(g) + 2KI (aq) — 2KCI (aq) + I, (aq)
Can bromine displace chlorine in a chemical reaction?
Chlorine dissolves in water and reacts with it, forming an acidic solution containing
hydrochloric acid (HCI) and hypochlorous acid (HOCI).
Chi) + H,O() +> HCl@q) + HOClfaq)
This type of reaction 1s called a disproportionation reaction, where chlorine is itself reduced
and oxidized.
Chlorine is commercially used as a bleaching agent and disinfectant (kills germs). As
elemental chlorine or as chlorine water, it is strong enough to oxidize dyes and to bleach
coloured materials. For example, it can be used to remove yellow or brown colours from
wood pulp, paper and cotton.

PROJECT 4.2
1. Have you ever wondered how glass retains different colours? Consult books
in your library and make list of the compounds added to impart colour to the
glass.
2. Can glass be recycled; how?
Submit your findings to your teacher.
Glass
Glass is an amorphous or non-crystalline solid material. Almost all glass contains silica as
the main component. Quartz glass is made by melting pure silica, SiO, at a temperature of
about 2300°C and then pouring the molten viscous liquid into moulds. It is of high strength,
low thermal expansion and highly transparent.
Soda-lime glass is ordinary glass which is amixture of sodium silicate and calcium silicate.
Itis made by heating a mixture of silica sand, sodium carbonate or sodium sulphate and
limestone. The reactions that take place in forming soda-lime glass are the following:
Na,cO, + SiO, — NaSiO, + CO,
CaCO, + SiO, > CaSiO, + CO,
Soda-lime glass accounts for about 90% of manufactured glass. This type of glass is widely
used for window panes, bottles, dishes etc.
Borosilicate glass is commonly known as Pyrex. It is manufactured using boron (III)
oxide, B,O,, instead of limestone or calcium oxide. This glass has high resistance to chemical
corrosion and temperature changes and is widely used to make ovenware and laboratory
equipment such as flasks, beakers, and test tubes.
Steps in glass production
i) Batch preparation: refers to the preparation of the raw materials according to the
appropriate combinations. The raw materials are mixed in a proportion of 60%
sand, 21% sodium carbonate and 19% limestone.
ii) Glass melting: The raw materials and recycled glass (according to their colour)
are fed into a glass-melting furnace. The materials are then heated to a temperature
of about 1600°C to form a molten viscous liquid. Why are glasses is separated
according to the colour?
The furnace operates continuously, producing glass 24 hours a day. Substances that
give the glass different colours or improved chemical and physical properties such
as transparency, thermal and chemical stability and mechanical strength are added
during this process.
__ CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
iii) Glass forming: This is the stage in which the melted glass is made into a required
shape.
iv) Annealing: This is a process that involves the removal of internal stresses by reheating
the glass followed by a controlled slow-cooling cycle during which the stresses are
relieved.
v) Inspection: It involves testing of the glass product to check whether it fulfils desired
quality requirements or not.
vi) Packing and dispatching is the final stage before distribution.
Ceramics
Activity 4.16
1. Are you familiar with the pottery industry? Do you know any ceramic factories in
Ethiopia?
3. Prepare a list of ceramic products used in daily life.
Discuss in groups and give presentation to the class.
Ceramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent
cooling. Traditional ceramics, such as porcelain, tiles and pottery are formed from minerals
such as clay, talc and feldspar. Most industrial ceramics, however, are formed from
extremely pure powders of specialty chemicals, such as silicon carbide, alumina, barium
titanate, and titanium carbide.
Manufacturing of ceramics
The minerals used to make ceramics are dug out of the earth and are then crushed and
ground into a fine powder. Manufacturers often purify this powder by mixing it ina solution
and allowing a chemical precipitate (a uniform solid thatforms within a solution) to
form. The precipitate is then separated from the solution. The powder is heated to drive off
impurities including water.
The processes of manufacturing ceramics include:
A Moulding: After purification, small amounts ofwax are often added to bind the ceramic
powder and make it more workable. Plastics may also be added to the powder to
give the desired pliability and softness. The powder can then be shaped into different
objects by various moulding processes.
B_ Densification: The process of densification uses intense heat to condense a ceramic
object into astrong, dense product. After being moulded, the ceramic object is
heated in an electric furnace to temperatures between 1000°C and 1700°C. As the
@ chemistrycrave1o
ceramic heats, the powder particles coalesce, much as water droplets join at room
temperature. As the ceramic particles merge, the object becomes increasingly dense,
shrinking by up to 20 percent of its original size. The goal of this heating process is
to maximize the strength of ceramic by obtaining an internal structure that is compact
and extremely dense.
In general, most ceramics are hard and wear-resistant, brittle, refractory, thermal and
electrical insulators, non-magnetic, oxidation-resistant, and chemically stable.
Due to the wide range of properties of ceramic materials, they are used for a multitude of
applications.
¢ Well-known uses of ceramics: They are commonly found in art sculptures, dishes,
platters and other kitchenware, kitchen tiles and bath room structures.
e Lesser-known uses for ceramics: They are used as electrical insulators,
computers parts, tools, dental replacements, engine parts, and tiles on space shuttles
and to replace bones such as the bones in hips, knees and shoulders.
¢ Future uses of ceramics: In future, the ceramics might be used to remove impurities
from the drinking water, and to replace diseased heart valves.
Cement
Activity 4.17
1. How many cement factories do you know in Ethiopia? Name the regions where they
are found and share these with your classmates.
2. Why are cement factories located in rural areas of Ethiopia? Give your reasons to the
class.
Cement is made by heating limestone (chalk), alumina (AI,O,) and silica-bearing materials
such as clay to 1450°C in akiln using a process known as calcination. The resulting hard
substance called ‘clinker’ is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to
make “ordinary Portland cement” (OPC).
Cement mainly consists of calcium silicate (CaSiO,), calcium aluminate (CaALO,), tron
(III) oxide (Fe,O,) and magnesium oxide (MgO).
Portland cement is a very important building material, and was first discovered in England.
It received its name because, on setting, it hardens to a stone-like mass and was compared
to the famous Portland Rock of England. It is amixture of calcium and aluminium silicates
with gypsum.
Raw Materials: Limestone and clay are the chief raw materials used in the
manufacture of Portland cement.
_ CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
Manufacturing Process: First, limestone and clay are crushed separately. They are
then mixed in the required quantities and finally mixed and ground together, which can
be done either by the dry or wet process. The wet process is suitable if the limestone
and clay are soft. If the raw materials are hard, the dry process is preferred. The dry
process is cost-effective because fuel consumption is less when the raw materials are
burnt in a rotary kiln.

The resulting mixture of all these silicates and aluminates is called cement clinker. After
cooling, it is mixed with 2-3% gypsum (calcium sulphate) and ground to a fine powder.
Gypsum slows down the rate of setting of cement, so that the cement hardens adequately.

Setting of Cement
When mixed with water cement first forms a plastic mass that hardens after sometime. This
is due to the formation of three-dimensional cross-links between -—Si-O-St- and —Si-O-—
Al- chains.
The first setting occurs within 24 hours, whereas, the subsequent hardening requires about
two weeks. In the hardening process of cement, the transition from plastic to solid state 1s
called setting.
PROJECT 4.3
Take a 0.5 kg of cement and mix it with correct proportion of sand and water. Mix
the compoment well till a palstic mass is formed. Take this plastic mass and construct
amodel of any object. Start pouring water on the model starting from the second day
onwards. Report the changes to the class after 24 hours and after two weeks.
Sugar Manufacturing
Activity 4.18
1. Prepare a list of foods and drinks used at your home in which sugar is an ingredient.
2. Is sugar made only from sugar cane? If no, what are the other sources? Discuss in
group and give a presentation to the class.
"CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT4)
Sugarcane is a perennial herb belonging to the grass family. Native to tropical and subtropical
regions of the world, this tropical grass is about 3 metres tall.
Planting: Sugarcane is planted in fields by workers or mechanical planters. Typical cane
soil is made from the mixture of silts, clay particles and organic matter. Fertilizers are
applied from the time of planting up until the beginning of the ripening period, depending on
the region where the crop is planted. Cane seasons last from 8-22 months.
1. Collecting the Harvest: Mature canes are gathered by a combination of manual
and mechanical methods. The cane is cut at ground level, the leaves are removed,
the top is trimmed off (by cutting offthe last maturejoint) the canes and transported
to a sugar factory.
Cleansing and Grinding: The stalks are thoroughly washed and cut at the sugar
mill. After the cleaning process, amachine led by a series of rotating knives, shreds
the cane into pieces. This is known as “grinding”. During grinding, hot water is
sprayed onto the sugarcane to dissolve the remaining hard sugar. The shredded
cane is then spread out on a conveyer belt.
Juicing: The shredded sugarcane travels on the conveyor belt through a series of
heavy-duty rollers, which extractjuice from the pulp. The pulp that remains, or “bagasse ”’
is dried and used as a fuel. The raw juice moves on through the mill to be clarified.
Clarifying: Carbon dioxide and milk of lime are added to the liquid sugar mixture,
which is heated until boiling. The process of clarifying begins at this stage. As the
carbon dioxide moves through the liquid, it forms calcium carbonate, which attracts
non-sugar debris (fats, gums and waxes) from the juice, and pulls them away from
the sugar juice. The juice is then pushed througha series of filters to remove any
remaining impurities.
Evaporation: The clear juice that results from the clarifying process is put under a
vacuum, where the juice boils at a low temperature and the water in it begins to
evaporate. It is heated until it forms into thick, brown syrup.
Crystallization: Crystallization is the process of evaporating the water from the
sugar syrup. Pulverized sugar is fed into a sterilized vacuum pan. As the liquid
evaporates, crystals form. The remaining mixture is a thick mass of large crystals.
These crystals are sent to a centrifuge that spins and dries them. The dried product
is raw sugar, which is edible.
Refinery: Raw sugar is transported to a cane sugar refinery for the removal of
molasses, minerals and other non-sugars that contaminate it. This is known as the
purification process. Raw sugar is mixed with a solution of sugar and water to loosen
the molasses from the outside of the raw sugar crystals, producing a thick matter
known as “magma”. Large machines then spin the magma, separating the molasses
from the crystals. The crystals are promptly washed, dissolved and filtered to remove
impurities. The golden syrup that is produced is then sent through filters, and SO, is

passed through it to remove the colour and water. The process of removing colour
is known as bleachinWhgat. is left is concentrated, clear syrup which is again fed
into a vacuum pan for evaporation.
8. Separation and packaging: Once the final evaporation and drying process is done,
screens separate the different-sized sugar crystals. Large and small crystals are
packaged and labelled as white refined sugar.

Paper and Pulp
Activity 4.19
Discuss the following issues in the group and give a presentation to your class:
1. Wasting paper is like chopping down trees. Comment.
2. Some papers are relatively cheap. The paper used for this grade 10 text book, for
example, is expensive. Are different types of paper manufactured by different
processes?
Wood is the raw material for making wood pulp and paper. Wood pulp is a dry fibrous
material used for making paper. The timber resources used to make wood pulp are referred
to as pulp wood. Wood pulp is made from soft-wood trees, such as spruce, pine, fir, larch
and hemlock, and from hard woods, such as eucalyptus, aspen and birch.
Wood is composed of cellulose, lignin, oils and resins. Lignin is used to bind fibres of
cellulose together. To provide wood pulp, the cellulose must be separated from the lignin.
Manufacturing ofpulp and paper involves the following steps:
1. Harvesting trees involves the cutting down of trees from their growing areas and
transporting the timber to the paper and pulp industry.
Preparation for pulping is astep in which the bark of the tree is removed and then
the wood is chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips (pieces).
Pulping is astep used to make wood pulp from the chipped wood pieces. This can
be accomplished by either mechanical or chemical means depending on the strength
and grade of paper to be manufactured.
a Mechanical pulping: It utilizes steam, pressure and high temperatures instead
of chemicals to tear the fibres. The fibre quality is greatly reduced because
mechanical pulping creates short, weak fibres that still contain the lignin that bonds
the fibres together. Paper used for newspapers are a typical product of
mechanical pulping.
Chemical pulping: Chemical pulp is produced by combining wood chips and
chemicals in large vessels called digesters. Heat and the chemicals break down
the lignin which binds the cellulose fibres together without seriously degrading
the cellulose fibres. Chemical pulp is manufactured using the Kraft process or
the Sulphite Process.
i) The Kraft Process is the dominant chemical pulping method. It is the most
widely used method for making pulp from all types of trees. The process uses
@— cemistaycrapeno
aqueous sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide as a digestion solution. After
digestion for about four hours at a temperature of 170°C, the pulp is separated
by filtration. This process uses a basic digestion medium.
ii) The Sulphite Process uses a cooking liquor (digestion) solution of sodium
bisulphate or magnesium bisulphate digester at pH of about 3 ina pulp.
The action of the hydrogen sulphide ions at 60°C over 6 to 12 hours dissolves
the lignin and separates it from the cellulose. After the process is complete,
the pulp is recovered by filtration.
The wood pulp achieved from the Sulphite or Kraft processes is washed to
remove chemicals and passed through a series of screens to remove foreign
materials.
4. Bleaching: It is the process of removing colouring matter from wood pulp and
increasing its brightness. The most common bleaching agents are strong oxidizing
agents such as chlorine, chlorine oxide, ozone and hydrogen peroxide.
5. Making paper from pulp: After bleaching, the pulp is processed into liquid stock
that can be transferred to a paper mill. The suspension is poured onto a continuously
moving screen belt and the liquor is allowed to seep away by gravity to produce
paper sheet. The continuous sheet then moves through additional rollers that compress
the fibres and remove the residual water to produce fine paper.
Tannery
Activity 4.20
1. The leather products of Ethiopia are durable and relatively cheaper than the same
products imported from outside. Why do people prefer to buy imported products?
What can you suggest to change this attitude? Discuss this matter in class in relation to
quality and availability of resources.
2. Why are leather products being replaced by synthetic products?
Discuss in groups and present to the class.
Tanning is a process of converting raw animal hides and skin to leather, using tannin. Leather
is a durable and flexible material created by the tanning of animal hides and skin. Tannin is
an acidic chemical that permanently alters the protein structure ofa skin so that it can never
return to rawhide or skin again.
Leather production involves various preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting
1. Preparatory stages are those in which the hide or skin is prepared for tanning.
This stage includes curing, soaking, flesh removal, hair removal, scudding, and
deliming.
| CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNTT4)
Curing: This process involves salting or drying the hide once it has been removed
from the animal. Curing is employed to prevent putrefaction of the protein
substance, collagen, from bacterial infection. Curing also removes excess water
from the hide and skin. Brine curing is the simplest and fastest method.
Soaking: In this process, cured hides are soaked in water for several hours to
several days to remove salt, dirt, debris, blood and excess animal fat from the
skin.
Flesh removal: In this process, animal hides are moved through a machine
that strips the flesh from the surface of the hide.
Hair removal: In this step, the soaked hides and skins are transported to large
vats where they are immersed in a mixture of lime and water. This process is
called liming. It loosens the hair from the skin and makes hair-removal easier.
After 1-10 days soaking, the hair is mechanically removed from the hide by a
hair-removing machine.
Scudding: This is the process in which hair and fat missed by the machines are
removed from the hide with a plastic tool or dull knife.
Deliming: This process involves the removal of lime from the skin or hide in a
vat of acid. After this preparatory process, the skin or hide is ready for tanning.
2. Tanning is a process that converts the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable
material. There are two main types of tanning:
a Vegetable or natural tanning: The skin is placed in a solution of tannin. Tannins
occur naturally in the barks and leaves of many plants. The primary barks used in
modern times are chestnut, oak, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove,
wattle (acacia) and myrobalan. Naturally tanned hide is flexible and is used
for making shoes, luggage and furniture.
Mineral tanning: In this process, the skin is placed in solutions of chemicals
such as chromium sulphate and other salts of chromium. Chrome tanning 1s faster
than natural (vegetable) tanning and requires only twenty four hours. The leather
is greenish-blue in colour derived from the chromium. This process produces
stretchable leather that is used for making garments and handbags.
3. Crusting: This is the final stage in leather manufacturing and includes dyeing, rolling
the leather to make it strong, stretching it in a heat-controlled room and performing
aprocess that involves covering the grain surface with chemical compounds such as
wax, oil, glazes etc. to make the leather very attractive.

Food Processing and Preservation
Activity 4.21
1. The rate of spoilage of food is faster in open air in comparison to foods kept inside the
refrigerator. Explain. Discuss in group and present your findings to the class.
Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or greatly reduce
spoilage, loss of quality, edibility or nutritive value caused or accelerated by micro-
organisms.
Preservation usually involves preventing the growth of bacteria, fungi and other micro-
organisms, as well as reducing the oxidation of fats, which causes rancidity.
Activity 4.22
1. What are the traditional methods used to preserve food for a long time without
spoilage at your home?
2. What modern methods of food preserving and processing do we use in Ethiopia?
Discuss in groups and give a presentation to the class.
Modern methods offood preservation are:
a Freezing: This is one of the most commonly used processes, commercially and
domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods such as potatoes, as well as
prepared foodstuffs that would not require freezing in their normal state.
b Freeze-drying: Water vapour has easier access through the cell structure of any
product compared to water-penetrating the product and evaporating from the surface
of the product as is the case of other drying methods. The gentle escape of water
vapour in the freeze-drying process leaves the product close to its original shape,
taste, and colour and there is no loss of aroma or flavour.
For example, liquids such as coffee, tea, juices and other extracts, vegetables,
segments of fish and meat products. Freeze-drying is a superior preservation method
for a variety of food products and food ingredients.
¢ Vacuum-packing: Stores food ina vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag
or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria of the oxygen needed for survival,
slowing down the rate of spoiling. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing
nuts to reduce loss of flavour from oxidation.

Pollution is any discharge ofa solid, liquid or gaseous substance or radiation (energy) into
an environment that causes unwanted changes. Pollution causes short-term or long-term
harm that affects the earth’s ecological balance and lowers the quality of life in the
environment. A pollutant is any substance that changes air, water or any other natural
resource in a way that impairs the use of the resource.
Pollutants are discharged into the environment as a result of natural events (like a volcanic
eruption) and as aresult of human activities (such as the operation of chemical industries,
agriculture, etc.). Pollutants can be classified by the type of pollution they cause: air pollution,
water pollution, and land pollution.
Air Pollution
Activity 4.24
1. Based on the situation of your locality, discuss the following issues in groups and
present the findings to the class:
a_ List some human activities which contribute to air pollution.
b How these activities contribute to air pollution?
c What solutions do you recommend to overcome these problems?
d What could be your contribution to reduce air pollutions?
2. Give your suggestions on the statement, ‘Air pollution any where is a potential threat
elsewhere.’
Air pollution is caused by the presence of contaminant gaseous substances in the air that
affect the lives of plants and animals on earth. Some common air pollutants are sulphur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, particulates,
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and lead compounds.
Sulphur dioxide (SO,): This enters the atmospheric air from the combustion of coal and
petroleum, and during extraction of metals from their sulphide ores. It causes coughing,
chest pains and shortness of breath. It is thought to be a cause for bronchitis and lung
diseases. It slowly oxidizes to SO, by reacting with the oxygen in the air.
Oxides of nitrogen: These can be formed in the atmosphere by natural processes like
thunderstorms. Combustion of fossil fuel containing nitrogen compounds as impurities and
exhaust gases from furnaces and engines increase the amount of nitric oxide, NO, and
nitrogen dioxide, NO,, in the atmosphere. Nitric oxide, NO, catalyzes the decomposition
of ozone in the upper layer of the atmosphere to oxygen, thus decreasing the ozone layer.
20, (g) 2 > 30,(g)
Nitric oxide is oxidized by oxygen to nitrogen dioxide in the presence of ultraviolet light.
2NO(g) + O,(g) — 2NO,(g)
SO,, SO, and NO, react with rainwater and form sulphurous acid (H,SO,), sulphuric
acid (H,SO,) and nitric acid (HNO,), respectively and cause acid rain. Acid rain accelerates
corrosion and the deterioration of metals, buildings, statues and also causes tree defoliation,
release of heavy metal ions from soil into water courses and drop in the pH of water in
rivers and lakes.
Hydrocarbons and ozone are responsible for photochemical smog. It is characterized by
a reddish-brown haze containing substances irritating to the eye, nose, and lungs, and
causes extensive damage to vegetation. Considerable amounts of hydrocarbons are released
into the atmosphere by the evaporation of gasoline as unburnt hydrocarbons in auto exhaust.
These substances react with ozone to give compounds that contribute to the oxidizing
nature of photochemical smog.
Carbon monoxide: Most of the carbon monoxide escapes into the atmosphere due to
the incomplete combustion of fuel. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide impairs vision,
produces headaches, and exerts strain on the heart. It also reduces the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood by reacting with haemoglobin.
Particulates: Dust storms, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and human activities such as
mining and burning coal and oil increase the amount of solid particles in the air. Industrial
areas contain particles of limestone, fertilizers, coal, stones, cement and silica. These
particulates irritate the lungs and deleteriously affect breathing.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigerants, solvents
and plastic foam-blowing agents. When entering the atmosphere, they penetrate into the
upper layers and interact with ultraviolet radiation as follows.
crcl, “> crc + cl
The free chlorine, Cl, reacts with ozone to form chlorine monoxide and oxygen.
Cl + O, ~ ClO} + O,
These reactions result in the conversion of ozone to molecular oxygen and contribute to
depletion of the ozone layer. This situation in the upper atmosphere allows dangerous
ultravioletradiatioton reach the earth’s surface. This radiation causes skin cancer in human beings.
Excess carbon dioxide: The combustion of coal and petroleum to generate electricity,
move our vehicles, heat our homes and supply power to our industrial machinery causes a
significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Combustion
of these fuels releases about 20 billion tonnes of CO, annually. The increase in the
concentration of CO, in the atmosphere has resulted in a rise in the average global
temperature, owing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide and water vapour absorb
infrared radiation, re-radiated from the earth, behaving like the glass in a green house.
Since CO, and water vapour absorb heat they are called green-house gases. Due to the
227
@&— cHemistryeraveto
absorption of heat by the green house gases in the atmosphere, the overall effect is global
warming (an increase in the average temperature of our planet). This rise in global
temperature causes melting of polar ice and thus additional water flowing into the oceans.
This situation, in turn, results in the rising of the levels of seas and oceans, flooding of
coastlines and lowland areas, which can submerge these areas.
Heavy metals: Lead contamination in the atmosphere is a result of vehicle engines that
use fuels containing tetraethyl lead which is added to the fuel to reduce engine knocking.
The use of lead paints also contributes towards lead contamination. High levels of lead
cause damage to the brain, kidneys and liver.

_ CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4) >
Water pollution is the degradation of the quality of water brought about by the discharge
into it of untreated sewage, industrial and agricultural waste, and oil spillage. In general,
water is said to be polluted if it contains matter that affects the health of living things or
causes damage to property. The major water pollutants are nitrate and phosphate fertilisers
washed out of the soil, phosphate detergents, untreated sewage, insecticides and herbicides,
and the heavy metal ion, acidic and/or basic residues released by industrial processes.
Phosphate and nitrate fertilisers washed out of the soil and phosphate detergents from
untreated water, enter natural water systems, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and seas.
These dissolved minerals are valuable nutrients for plants, and their discharge into the
water systems accelerates the growth of surface-water plants, such as algae. As a result,
less light reaches the bottom-living plants, which reduces the photosynthesis they need to
live, and they die. When these aquatic plants die, they rot under the action of bacteria
which multiply greatly and consume the oxygen dissolved in the water at a rate faster than
natural aeration or photosynthesis can replenish. Thus, the amount of oxygen in the water
decreases. This depletion of oxygen kills aquatic animals like fish. This sequence of events
is called eutrophication.
Insecticides (pesticides) and herbicides applied in agriculture may also be washed into
lakes, rivers, streams and seas. Some of the insecticides and herbicides do not decompose
easily and are persistent in the environment. Residues of these insecticides and herbicides
may enter the food chains and accumulate in an organism that is consumed by the next
organism. The increasing amount of insecticide and herbicide residue in the bodies of
animals causes health and behavioural problems.
The release of heavy metal ions, acidic and/or basic residues from industrial processes into
natural water systems, such as lakes and rivers, causes pH changes in the water. Water
organisms need specific ranges of water pH to survive, so these changes in pH can kill
them. In the same way, increasing concentrations of toxic metal ions kills some aquatic
organisms.
The release of untreated sewage to natural water systems can spread water-borne diseases
such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and polio.
Methods of Reducing Water Pollution:
Treatment of water before discharge into rivers and lakes.
2. Toavoid unnatural temperature changes in natural water systems, industries should
not discharge heat-ladened water into them.
Recycling industrial and agricultural wastes.
4. Using moderate amounts of agricultural chemicals and increasing the use of organic
fertilizers and biological methods to control pests.

Land Pollution
Activity 4.27
Discuss the following issues and present your answer to your class.
1. Do you observe any pollution of land in your environment?
2. What are the causes of land pollution?
3. Do you observe soil erosion in your area? What three major things do you believe
elected officials should take to decrease soil erosion in the region you live?
4. What should be your responsibility in solving the land pollution problems?
Land pollution is caused by things we put into it. It results from the spillage of oil,
leaching of harmful chemicals and heavy metal ions, and dumping of non-
biodegradable wastes such as plastics.
Factors involved in land pollution include:
¢ Spillages of oil from leaking pipelines.
¢ Harmful heavy metal ions from buried waste leaching into water systems.
¢ Leaching of harmful chemicals from corroded metal drums which have been buried
underground.
¢ Dumping of non-biodegradable (do not decompose by the action of bacteria)
wastes like plastics which remain unchanged in the soil for decades or hundreds of
years. Their accumulation in the soil hinders air and water movement and affects the
growth of plants.
¢ Excessive use of synthetic fertilisers in agricultural activities also contributes towards
land pollution.
What are the contributions of commercial inorganic fertilizers to land pollution?

¢ A chemical industry is any institution involved in the production of chemicals.
¢ A chemical industry is characterized by using raw materials available in nature
and transforming them into desired products by chemical means.
¢ Most of the materials used by the industries are present in nature.
¢ Natural resources are classified as renewable and non-renewable.
¢ Aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. It is manufactured
by the electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide mixed with cryolite using the
Hall process.
¢ Aluminium is used to make light-weight alloys that can be used for aircraft
and similar constructions.
¢ Aluminium resists corrosion due to the formation of a thin film of an oxide on
its surface.
¢ Iron is the second-most abundant metal in the earth's crust.
¢ Iron is extracted in a blastfurnace. The furnace is charged with iron ore, coke
and limestone, and hot air is blown up from the bottom.
¢ Limestone is used in the blastfurnace to remove impurities like sand (silica) in
the form of slag.
¢ The type of iron obtained directly from the blastfurnace is called pig iron and
it is impure.
¢ Wrought iron is the purest form of iron obtained from pig-iron by removing
most of the impurities.
¢ Steel is an alloy of iron containing definite amounts of carbon and other metals
like chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium, manganese etc.
¢ Steel is manufactured by the Bessemer Converter, Open-Hearth Furnace and
Basic Oxygen Processes.
* Copper is extracted by roasting chalcopyrites (CuFeS,).
¢ Copper that is obtained by roasting chalcopyrites is called blister copper. It is
impure, and it is refinedfurther by electrolysis.
¢ Copper is malleable and ductile, a good conductor of heat and electricity and
is used to make electric wires and in the manufacture of alloys.
¢ Nitrogen constitutes about 80% by volume of atmospheric air.
¢ Nitrogen is manufactured by the fractional distillation of liquefied air.
¢ Nitrogen is relatively inert. However, its reactivity increases when heated and
combined with metals of group IA and IIA to form nitrides and with oxygen to
form oxides like NO and NO,
¢ Phosphorus is manufactured by heating a mixture of rock phosphate, coke
(carbon) and silica in an electric furnace.
¢ Phosphorus has two common allotropes, white and red phosphorus. White
Phosphorus is highly reactive, while red phosphorous is relatively stable.
¢ White phosphorus is stored under water.
¢ Phosphorus reacts with oxygen and chlorine.
¢ Oxygen makes up about 20% by volume of air. It is manufactured by the
fractional distillation of liquid air.
¢ Oxygen is the most abundant element in the earth's crust.
¢ Sulphur exists in the elemental state in underground deposits from which it is
extracted by the Frasch process.
¢ Sulphur reacts with oxygen to form sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide.
¢ Sulphur is usedfor the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the Contact Process.
¢ Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine.
¢ Chlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent and reacts with heated metals to form
chlorides.
¢ Chlorine and chlorine water are used to bleach coloured materials and as
disinfectant.
¢ Glass is a mixture of two or more silicates.
¢ Pyrex is a glass containing boron. It resists high temperatures.
¢ Ceramics are materials that are baked or fired at very high temperatures.
¢ Cement is made by heating a ground mixture ofsand and clay. It contains calcium
oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide, iron (III) oxide, and magnesium oxide.
¢ Sugar is manufacturedfrom sugarcane in a series of steps.
¢ Paper and pulp are manufactured from trees in a series of steps. Bleaching
agents such as chlorine, chlorine oxide, ozone or hydrogen peroxide are used
in paper and pulp production.
¢ Tanning is a process of converting skin to leather.
¢ The methods used in food processing and preservation are salting, pickling,
sugaring, smoking, drying, canning etc.
¢ Pollution is the discharge of harmful waste material into the environment.
¢ The three types ofpollution are air, land and water pollution.
¢ Air pollution is caused by the release of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, particulates, CFCs, and lead compounds
etc. into the atmosphere.
¢ Water pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated sewage, industrial and
agricultural waste and oil spillage.
¢ Land pollution results from the spillage of oil, leaching of harmful chemicals
and heavy metal ions, and dumping of non-biodegradable wastes such as
plastics.

electrons, called lone pairs. Since there are a total
of four electron pairs around a single-bonded
oxygen atom, the shape around this oxygen atom
is a variation of the tetrahedral shape. Because
there are only two bonds, however, the shape
around a single-bonded oxygen atom is usually
referred to as bent.
Three-Dimensional Structural Diagrams
Two-dimensional structural diagrams of organic compounds, such as
condensed structural diagrams and line structural diagrams, work well
for flat molecules. As shown in the table above, however, molecules
containing single-bonded carbon atoms are not flat.
You can use a three-dimensional structural diagram to draw the tetra-
hedral shape around a single-bonded carbon atom. In a three-dimensional
diagram, wedges are used to give the impression that an atom or group is
coming forward, out of the page. Dashed or dotted lines are used to show
that an atom or group is receding, or being pushed back into the page. In

Molecular Shape and Polarity
The three-dimensional shape of a molecule is particularly important when
the molecule contains polar covalent bonds. As you may recall from your
previous chemistry course, a polar covalent bond is a covalent bond
between two atoms with different electronegativities.
Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts
electrons in a chemical bond. The electrons in a polar covalent bond are
attracted more strongly to the atom with the higher electronegativity. This
atom has a partial negative charge, while the other atom has a partial posi-
tive charge. Thus, every polar bond has a bond dipole: a partial negative
charge and a partial positive charge, separated by the length of the bond.
Figure 1.4 illustrates the polarity of a double carbon-oxygen bond. Oxygen
has a higher electronegativity than carbon. Therefore, the oxygen atom in
a carbon-oxygen bond has a partial negative charge, and the carbon atom
has a partial positive charge.

which has a partial positive
charge.
Predicting Molecular Polarity
A molecule is considered to be polar, or to have a molecular polarity,
when the molecule has an overall imbalance of charge. That is, the
molecule has a region with a partial positive charge, and a region with a
partial negative charge. Surprisingly, not all molecules with polar bonds
are polar molecules. For example, a carbon dioxide molecule has two
polar C=O bonds, but it is not a polar molecule. On the other hand, a
water molecule has two polar O—H bonds, and it is a polar molecule.
How do you predict whether or not a molecule that contains polar bonds
has an overall molecular polarity? To determine molecular polarity, you
must consider the shape of the molecule and the bond dipoles within the
molecule.
If equal bond dipoles act in opposite directions in three-dimensional
space, they counteract each other. A molecule with identical polar bonds
that point in opposite directions is not polar. Figure 1.5 shows two
examples, carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride. Carbon dioxide, COz,
has two polar C=O bonds acting in opposite directions, so the molecule
is non-polar. Carbon tetrachloride, CCli, has four polar C—Cl bonds in
a tetrahedral shape. You can prove mathematically that four identical
dipoles, pointing toward the vertices of a tetrahedron, counteract each
other exactly. (Note that this mathematical proof only applies if all four
bonds are identical.) Therefore, carbon tetrachloride is also non-polar.

GGETEERED The red colour indicates a region of negative charge, and the blue colour
indicates a region of positive charge. In non-polar molecules, such as carbon dioxide (A) and
carbon tetrachloride (B), the charges are distributed evenly around the molecule.
If the bond dipoles in a molecule do not counteract each other exactly, the
molecule is polar. Two examples are water, H2,O, and chloroform, CHCl;,
shown in Figure 1.6. Although each molecule has polar bonds, the bond
dipoles do not act in exactly opposite directions. The bond dipoles do not
counteract each other, so these two molecules are polar.

(GETISEE In polar molecules, such as water (A) and chloroform (B), the charges are
distributed unevenly around the molecule. One part of the molecule has an overall negative
charge, and another part has an overall positive charge.
The steps below summarize how to predict whether or not a molecule
is polar. The Sample Problem that follows gives three examples.
Note: For the purpose of predicting molecular polarity, you can assume
that C—H bonds are non-polar. In fact, they have a very low polarity.
Step1 Does the molecule have polar bonds? If your answer is no, see
below. If your answer is yes, go to step 2.
If a molecule has no polar bonds, it is non-polar.
Examples: CH;CH,CH;, CH, == CH,
Step 2 Is there more than one polar bond? If your answer is no, see below.
If your answer is yes, go to step 3.
Ifa molecule contains only one polar bond, it is polar.
Examples: CH3;Cl, CH3CH,CH,Cl
Step 3 Do the bond dipoles act in opposite directions and counteract each
other? Use your knowledge of three-dimensional molecular shapes
to help you answer this question. If in doubt, use a molecular model
to help you visualize the shape of the molecule.
If a molecule contains bond dipoles that do not counteract each
other, the molecule is polar.
Examples: H,0, CHCl,
If the molecule contains dipoles that counteract each other, the
molecule is non-polar.

General Rules for Naming Organic Compounds
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has set
standard rules for naming organic compounds. The systematic (or IUPAC)
names of alkanes and most other organic compounds follow the same
pattern, shown below.
prefix ++ root + suffix
The Root: How Long Is the Main Chain?
The root of a compound’s name indicates the number of carbon atoms in
the main (parent) chain or ring. Table 1.2 gives the roots for hydrocarbon
chains that are up to ten carbons long. To determine which root to use,
count the carbons in the main chain, or main ring, of the compound. If the
compound is an alkene or alkyne, the main chain or ring must include the
multiple bond.

highlighted.
H.C CH,
H,C— CHe
CHs
(A) There are six carbons in the main chain. The root is -hex-. (B) There are five
carbons in the main ring. The root is -pent-.
The Suffix: What Family Does the Compound Belong To?
The suffix indicates the type of compound, according to the functional
groups present. (See Table 1.4 on page 22.) As you progress through this
chapter, you will learn the suffixes for different chemical families. In your
previous chemistry course, you learned the suffixes -ane for alkanes, -ene
for alkenes, and -yne for alkynes. Thus, an alkane composed of six carbon
atoms in a chain is called hexane. An alkene with three carbons is called
propene.
Chapter 1 Classifying Organic Compounds » MHR 13
The Prefix: What Is Attached to the Main Chain?
The prefix indicates the name and location of each branch and functional
group on the main carbon chain. Most organic compounds have branches,
called alkyl groups, attached to the main chain. An alkyl group is obtained
by removing one hydrogen atom from an alkane. To name an alkyl! group,
change the -ane suffix to -yl. For example, — CH; is the alkyl group that is
derived from methane, CHg. It is called the methyl group, taken from the
root meth-. Table 1.3 gives the names of the most common alkyl! groups.

Read the steps below to review how to name hydrocarbons. Then examine
the two Sample Problems that follow.
How to Name Hydrocarbons
Step 1 Find the root: Identify the longest chain or ring in the hydrocarbon.
If the hydrocarbon is an alkene or an alkyne, make sure that you
include any multiple bonds in the main chain. Remember that the
chain does not have to be in a straight line. Count the number of
carbon atoms in the main chain to obtain the root. If it is a cyclic
compound, add the prefix -cyclo- before the root.
Step 2 Find the suffix: If the hydrocarbon is an alkane, use the suffix -ane.
Use -ene if the hydrocarbon is an alkene. Use -yne if the hydrocarbon
is an alkyne. If more than one double or triple bond is present, use
the prefix di- (2) or tri- (3) before the suffix to indicate the number
of multiple bonds.
Step 3 Give a position number to every carbon atom in the main chain.
Start from the end that gives you the lowest possible position
number for the double or triple bond, if there is one. If there is no
double or triple bond, number the compound so that the branches
have the lowest possible position numbers.
Step 4 Find the prefix: Name each branch as an alkyl group, and give it
a position number. If more than one branch is present, write the
names of the branches in alphabetical order. Put the position
number of any double or triple bonds after the position numbers
and names of the branches, just before the root. This is the prefix.
Note: Use the carbon atom with the /Jowest position number to give
the location of a double or triple bond.
Step 5 Put the name together: prefix + root + suffix.

To draw a condensed structural diagram of a hydrocarbon, follow the
steps below. Then examine the Sample Problem that follows.
How to Draw Hydrocarbons
Step1 Draw the carbon atoms of the main chain. Leave space after each
carbon atom for bonds and hydrogen atoms to be added later.
Number the carbon atoms.
Step 2 Draw any single, double, or triple bonds between the carbon atoms.
Step 3 Add the branches to the appropriate carbon atoms of the main chain.
Step 4 Add hydrogen atoms so that each carbon atom forms a total of
4 bonds. Remember that double bonds count as 2 bonds and triple
bonds count as 3 bonds.
Drawing an Alkane
Problem
Draw a condensed structural diagram for 3-ethyl-2-methylhexane.
Solution
Step1 The main chain is hexane. Therefore, there are six carbon atoms.
Step 2 This compound is an alkane, so all carbon-carbon bonds are single.
Step 3 The ethyl group is attached to carbon number 3. The methyl group
is attached to carbon number 2.
Step 4 Add hydrogen atoms so that each carbon atom forms 4 bonds.

Aromatic Compounds
If you completed the Concept Check activity on page 12, you drew a
possible structure for benzene. For many years, scientists could not
determine the structure of benzene. From its molecular formula, CgHe.,
scientists reasoned that it should contain two double bonds and one triple
bond, or even two triple bonds. Benzene, however, does not undergo the
same reactions as other compounds with double or triple bonds.
We know today that benzene is a cyclic compound with the equivalent
of three double bonds and three single bonds, as shown in Figure 1.9(A).
G oO However, the electrons that form the double bonds in benzene are spread
out and shared over the whole molecule. Thus, benzene actually has six
identical bonds, each one half-way between a single and a double bond.

hydrogen atom from an N—H, O—H, or F—H group on one molecule,
and a nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine atom on another molecule.
e The attractive forces between polar molecules are called dipole-dipole
interactions. These forces cause polar molecules to cling to each other.
e Dispersion forces are attractive forces that occur between all covalent
molecules. These forces are usually very weak for small molecules, but
they strengthen as the size of the molecule increases.
The process that is outlined on the next page will help you to predict the
physical properties of organic compounds by examining the intermolecular
forces between molecules. As you progress through the chapter, referring
back to this process will enable you to understand the reasons behind
trends in physical properties.

Intermolecular Forces and Physical Properties
Draw two or three molecules of the same organic compound close
together on a page. If you are considering the solubility of one com-
pound in another, sketch the two different molecules close together.
Ask the following questions about the intermolecular interactions
between the molecules of each compound:
1. Can the molecules form hydrogen bonds?
If the molecules have O—H, N—H, or
H—F bonds, they can form hydrogen O O
bonds with themselves and with water. HW Nu HW’ Nu
The diagram to the right illustrates Oe
hydrogen bonding between water / Nu
molecules. If the molecules contain
O, N, or F atoms that are not bonded
to hydrogen atoms, they may accept hydrogen bonds from water,
even though they cannot form hydrogen bonds with themselves.
Molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with themselves have
a higher boiling point than similar molecules that cannot form
hydrogen bonds with themselves. For example, alcohols can form
hydrogen bonds, but alkanes cannot. Therefore, alcohols have
higher boiling points than alkanes.
Molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with water, or can
accept hydrogen bonds from water, are usually soluble in water.
For example, many alcohols are soluble in water because they can
form hydrogen bonds with water.
2. Are the molecules polar?
The molecules are polar if they have polar bonds, and if these
bonds do not act in opposite directions and counteract each other.
Polar molecules are attracted to each other by dipole-dipole forces.
Polar molecules usually have a higher boiling point than
similar non-polar molecules. Also, polar molecules that can form
hydrogen bonds have an even higher boiling point than polar
molecules that cannot form hydrogen bonds. For example, ethanol,
CH3CH,0H, is polar. Its molecules can form hydrogen bonds.
Methoxymethane, CH;0CHs3, is an isomer of ethanol. It is also
polar, but its molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds. Thus,
ethanol has a higher boiling point than methoxymethane. Both of
these compounds have a higher boiling point than the non-polar
molecule ethane, CH3;CH3.
Polar molecules with a large non-polar hydrocarbon part are
less polar than polar molecules with a smaller non-polar hydrocar-
bon part. For example, octanol, CH;CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,CH,0OH,
is less polar than ethanol, CH;CH,OH.
Polar molecules with a large hydrocarbon part are less soluble
in water than polar molecules with a smaller hydrocarbon part.
For example, octanol, CH3CH,CH,CH,CH2,CH,CH2CH,20H, is less
soluble in water than ethanol, CH;CH,OH.
continued on the next page
Chapter 1 Classifying Organic Compounds * MHR_~ = 23
3. How strong are the dispersion forces?
Dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces. They are stronger,
however, when the hydrocarbon part of a molecule is very large.
Thus, a large molecule has stronger dispersion interactions than a
smaller molecule.
A molecule with a greater number of carbon atoms usually has
a higher boiling point than the same type of molecule with fewer
carbon atoms. For example, hexane, CH;CH,CH,CH,CH.CH; has a
higher boiling point than ethane, CH3CH3.
The melting points of organic compounds follow approximately
the same trend as their boiling points. There are some anomalies,
however, due to more complex forces of bonding in solids.

Compounds With Single-Bonded Functional Groups
Alcohols, alkyl halides, ethers, and amines all have functional groups
with single bonds. These compounds have many interesting uses in
daily life. As you learn how to identify and name these compounds, think
about how the intermolecular forces between their molecules affect their
properties and uses.
Alcohols
An alcohol is an organic compound that contains the —OH functional
group. Depending on the position of the hydroxyl] group, an alcohol
can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Figure 1.13 gives some examples

Table 1.6 lists some common physical properties of alcohols. As
you learned earlier in this chapter, alcohols are polar molecules that
experience hydrogen bonding. The physical properties of alcohols
depend on these characteristics.
Table 1.6 Physical Properties of Alcohols
Polarity of functional group |The O—H bond is very polar. As the number of carbon
atoms in an alcohol becomes larger, the alkyl group’s
non-polar nature becomes more important than the polar
O—H bond. Therefore small alcohols are more polar
than alcohols with large hydrocarbon portions.
Hydrogen bonding Alcohols experience hydrogen bonding with other
alcohol molecules and with water.
Solubility in water The capacity of alcohols for hydrogen bonding makes
them extremely soluble in water. Methanol and ethanol
are miscible (infinitely soluble) with water. The
solubility of an alcohol decreases as the number of
carbon atoms increases.
Melting and boiling points | Due to the strength of the hydrogen bonding, most
alcohols have higher melting and boiling points than
alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. Most
alcohols are liquids at room temperature.
Additional Characteristics of Alcohols
e Alcohols are extremely flammable, and should be treated with caution.
e Most alcohols are poisonous. Methanol can cause blindness or death
when consumed. Ethanol is consumed widely in moderate quantities,
but it causes impairment and/or death when consumed in excess.
Chapter 1 Classifying Organic Compounds » MHR 27
Alkyl Halides
An alkyl halide (also known as a haloalkane) is an alkane in which one
or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with halogen atoms, such
as F, Cl, Br, or I. The functional group of alkyl halides is R—X, where X
represents a halogen atom. Alkyl! halides are similar in structure, polarity,
and reactivity to alcohols. To name an alkyl halide, first name the parent
hydrocarbon. Then use the prefix fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-, with a
position number, to indicate the presence of a fluorine atom, chlorine
atom, bromine atom, or iodine atom. The following Sample Problem
shows how to name an alky] halide.

Table 1.7 describes some physical properties of ethers. Like alcohols,
ethers are polar molecules. Ethers, however, cannot form hydrogen bonds
with themselves. The physical properties of ethers depend on these
characteristics.
30 MHR « Unit 1 Organic Chemistry
Table 1.7 Physical Properties of Ethers
Polarity of functional group | The bent shape around the oxygen atom in an ether
means that the two C—O dipoles do not counteract each
other. Because a C—O bond is less polar than an O—H
bond, an ether is less polar than an alcohol.
Hydrogen bonding Because there is no O—H bond in an ether, hydrogen
bonding does not occur between ether molecules. Ethers
can accept hydrogen bonding from water molecules.
Solubility in water Ethers are usually soluble in water. The solubility of an
ether decreases as the size of the alkyl groups increases.
Melting and boiling points | The boiling points of ethers are much lower than the
boiling points of alcohols with the same number of
carbon atoms.
Additional Characteristics of Ethers
e Like alcohols, ethers are extremely flammable and should be used
with caution.
Amines
An organic compound with the functional group —NH2, —NHR, or
—NR,; is called an amine. The letter N refers to the nitrogen atom. The
letter R refers to an alkyl group attached to the nitrogen. The general
formula of an amine is R—NR’:. Amines can be thought of as derivatives
of the ammonia molecule, NH3. They are classified as primary, secondary,
or tertiary, depending on how many alkyl groups are attached to the
nitrogen atom. Note that the meanings of “primary,” “seconday,” and
“tertiary” are slightly different from their meanings for alcohols.

Step 3 Name the other alkyl group(s) attached to the nitrogen atom. Instead
of position numbers, use the letter N- to locate the group(s). (If two
identical alkyl groups are attached to the nitrogen atom, use N,N-.)

Amines are polar compounds. Primary and secondary amines can form
hydrogen bonds, but tertiary amines cannot. Table 1.8 lists some common
physical properties of amines.
Table 1.8 Physical Properties of Amines
Polarity of functional group C—N and N—H bonds are polar. Thus, amines are
usually polar.
Hydrogen bonding The presence of one or more N—H bonds allows
hydrogen bonding to take place.
Solubility in water Because of hydrogen bonding, amines with low
molecular masses (four or less carbon atoms) are
completely miscible with water. The solubility
of an amine decreases as the number of carbon
atoms increases.
Melting and boiling points The boiling points of primary and secondary amines
(which contain N—H bonds) are higher than the boiling
points of tertiary amines (which do not contain an N—H
bond). The higher boiling points are due to hydrogen
bonding between amine molecules.
Additional Characteristics of Amines

amines that are produced by plants have medicinal properties.

hydrocarbon part are less soluble in water.
Melting and The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are lower
boiling points than the boiling points of the corresponding alcohols. They are
higher than the boiling points of the corresponding alkanes.
Additional Characteristics of Aldehydes and Ketones
e In general, aldehydes have a strong pungent smell, while ketones
smell sweet. Aldehydes with higher molecular masses have a pleasant
smell. For example, cinnamaldehyde gives cinnamon its spicy smell.
(See Figure 1.20.) Aldehydes and ketones are often used to make
perfumes. The rose ketones (shown in Figure 1.21) provide up to 90%
of the characteristic rose odour. Perfumers mix organic compounds,
such as the rose ketones, to obtain distinctive and attractive scents.
e Since aldehydes and ketones are polar, they can act as polar solvents.
Because of the non-polar hydrocarbon part of their molecules, aldehydes
and ketones can also act as solvents for non-polar compounds. For
example, 2-propanone (common name: acetone) is an important organic
solvent in the chemical industry.
e Table 1.10 compares the boiling points of an alkane, an alcohol, and an
aldehyde with the same number of carbon atoms. You can see that the
boiling point of an alcohol is much greater than the boiling point of an
alkane or an aldehyde. HC—=CH—C—H

Solubility in water Carboxylic acids with low molecular masses are very
soluble in water. The first four simple carboxylic acids
(methanoic acid, ethanoic acid, propanoic acid, and
butanoic acid) are miscible with water.
Like alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes, the solubility
of carboxylic acids in water decreases as the number of
carbon atoms increases.
Melting and boiling points | Because of the strong hydrogen bonds between
molecules, the melting and boiling points of carboxylic
acids are very high.
40 MHR-* Unit 1 Organic Chemistry
Additional Characteristics of Carboxylic Acids
¢ Carboxylic acids often have unpleasant odours. For example, butanoic
acid has the odour of stale sweat.
e The —OH group in a carboxylic acid does not behave like the basic
hydroxide ion, OH. Oxygen has a high electronegativity (attraction
to electrons) and there are two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid
functional group. These electronegative oxygen atoms help to carry the
extra negative charge that is caused when a positive hydrogen atom
dissociates. This is why the hydrogen atom in a carboxylic acid is able
to dissociate, and the carboxylic acid behaves like an acid.

between carboxylic acid molecules.

Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
The strong-smelling compounds you prepared in Investigation 1-A do not
fit into any of the organic families you have studied so far. According to
their molecular formulas, however, they are isomers of carboxylic acids.
They are esters. Because an ester is obtained by replacing the — OH
group of a carboxylic acid with a different group, it is called a derivative
of a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have several important derivatives.
In this section, you will study two of these derivatives: esters and amides.

GFETESRET3 When heated, butanoic acid reacts with ethanol to produce an ester called
ethyl butanoate.
To name an ester, you must recognize that an ester can be thought of as
having two distinct parts. The main part of the ester contains the — COO
group. This part comes from the parent acid. When numbering the main
chain of a carboxylic acid, the carbon atom in the carboxyl] group is always
given position number 1. The second part of an ester is the alkyl group.
To name an ester, follow the steps below.
How to Name an Ester
Step1 Identify the main part of the ester, which contains the C—O group.
This part comes from the parent acid. Begin by naming the parent
acid.
Step 2 Replace the -oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with
-oate.
Step 3 The second part of an ester is the alkyl group that is attached to the
oxygen atom. Name this as you would name any other alkyl group.
Step 4 Put the two names together. Note that esters are named as two
words. (See Figure 1.27.)

Table 1.13, on the next page, describes some of the physical properties
of esters. As you will see, esters have different physical properties than
carboxylic acids, even though esters and carboxylic acids are isomers of
each other.
Chapter 1 Classifying Organic Compounds» MHR 45
Table 1.13 Physical Properties of Esters
Polarity of functional group Like carboxylic acids, esters are usually polar molecules.
Hydrogen bonding Esters do not have an O—H bond. Therefore, they cannot
form hydrogen bonds with other ester molecules.
Solubility in water Esters can accept hydrogen bonds from water. Therefore,
esters with very low molecular masses are soluble in
water. Esters with carbon chains that are longer than
three or four carbons are not soluble in water.
Melting and boiling points Because esters cannot form hydrogen bonds, they have
low boiling points. They are usually volatile liquids at
room temperature.
Additional Characteristics of Esters
e Esters often have pleasant odours and tastes, so they are used to
produce perfumes and artificial flavours. In fact, the characteristic tastes
and smells of many fruits come from esters. (See Figure 1.28.)
Amides
An ester can be thought of as the combination of a carboxylic acid and
an alcohol. Similarly, you can think of an amide as the combination of
a carboxylic acid and ammonia or an amine. An amide is an organic
compound that has a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and
single-bonded to a nitrogen atom.
Amides have the functional group below:

describes some physical properties of amides.
46 MHR-* Unit 1 Organic Chemistry
How to Name an Amide
Step1 Locate the part of the amide that contains the C—O group. Name
the parent carboxylic acid that this part derives from. Note: The
carbon in the C=O group is always given position number 1.
Step 2 Replace the -oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with the
suffix -amide.
Step 3 Decide whether the compound is a primary, secondary, or tertiary
amide:
e If there are two hydrogen atoms (and no alkyl groups) attached
to the nitrogen atom, the compound is a primary amide and
needs no other prefixes.
e If there is one alkyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, the
compound is a secondary amide. Name the alkyl group, and
give it location letter N- to indicate that it is bonded to the
nitrogen atom.
e If there are two alkyl groups, the compound is a tertiary amide.
Place the alkyl groups in alphabetical order. Use location letter
N- before each group to indicate that it is bonded to the nitrogen
atom. If the two groups are identical, use N,N-.
Step 4 Put the name together: prefix + root + suffix.

Table 1.14 Physical Properties of Amides
Polarity of functional group | Because the nitrogen atom attracts electrons more
strongly than carbon or hydrogen atoms, the C—N and
N-H bonds are polar. As a result, the physical
properties of amides are similar to the physical
properties of carboxylic acids.
Hydrogen bonding Because primary amides have two N—H bonds, they have
even stronger hydrogen bonds than carboxylic acids.
Secondary amides also experience hydrogen bonding.
Solubility in water Amides are soluble in water. Their solubility decreases
as the non-polar hydrocarbon part of the molecule
increases in size.
Melting and boiling points =| Primary amides have much higher melting and boiling
points than carboxylic acids. Many simple amides are
solid at room temperature.
Additional Characteristics of Amides
e An amide called acetaminophen is a main component of many
NH—C—CH3; painkillers.
e Urea, another common example of an amide, is made from the reaction

Addition, Substitution, and Elimination Reactions
Addition reactions, substitution reactions, and elimination reactions are
the three main types of organic reactions. Most organic reactions can be
classified as one of these three types.
Addition Reactions
In an addition reaction, atoms are added to a double or triple bond. One
bond of the multiple bond breaks so that two new bonds can form. To
recognize an addition reaction, remember that two compounds usually
react to form one major product. (Sometimes two isomers are formed.)
The product has more atoms bonded to carbon atoms than the organic
reactant did. A general example of addition to an alkene is given below.

—CH==CH— + XY ~ —CH—CH—
Addition reactions are common for alkenes and alkynes. Addition
reactions can also occur at a C=O bond. Some examples of addition
reactions are shown on the next page.

Elimination Reactions
In an elimination reaction, atoms are removed from a molecule to form a
double bond. This type of reaction is the reverse of an addition reaction.
One reactant usually breaks up to give two products. The organic product
typically has fewer atoms bonded to carbon atoms than the organic
reactant did.
Alcohols often undergo elimination reactions when they are heated in
the presence of strong acids, such as sulfuric acid, H2SO,, which acts
as a Catalyst. (See the first example below.) Alkyl halides also undergo
elimination reactions to produce alkenes. (See the second example.)

Oxidation and Reduction
An important type of organic reaction occurs when there is a change in
the number of hydrogen or oxygen atoms that are bonded to carbon. In
Unit 5, you will take a close look at oxidation-reduction reactions in terms
of the transfer of electrons. As you will learn, oxidation and reduction
always occur together. One reactant is oxidized while the other reactant
is reduced. In this unit, however, you will focus on the organic reactant
only. Therefore, you will deal with oxidation and reduction separately, as
they apply to organic compounds. In organic chemistry, oxidation and
reduction are defined by the changes of the bonds to carbon atoms in the
organic reactant.
Chapter 2 Reactions of Organic Compounds» MHR_- 459
Oxidation
In organic chemistry, oxidation is defined as a reaction in which a carbon
atom forms more bonds to oxygen, O, or less bonds to hydrogen, H. An
oxidation that involves the formation of double C—O bonds may also be
classified as an elimination reaction.
For example, alcohols can be oxidized to produce aldehydes and
ketones. Oxidation occurs when an organic compound reacts with an
oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents include acidified potassium
permanganate, KMnOg,, acidified potassium dichromate, K,Cr,07, and
ozone, O3. The symbol [O] is used to symbolize an oxidizing agent, as
shown below. Note that equations for the oxidation of organic compounds
are often left unbalanced. The purpose of the equation is to show the
changes in the organic reactant only.

To identify an oxidation, count and compare the number of C—H
and C—O bonds in both the reactant and product. Try it for the
following example.
H OH H O
H—C—C—H + [O] > H— | ty
I 4
ethanol ethanal
Reduction
In organic chemistry, reduction is defined as a reaction in which a
carbon atom forms fewer bonds to oxygen, O, or more bonds to hydrogen,
H. Often, a C=O bond or C=C bond is reduced to a single bond by
reduction. A reduction that transforms double C=C or C=O bonds to
single bonds may also be classified as an addition reaction. Aldehydes,
ketones, and carboxylic acids can be reduced to become alcohols. Alkenes
and alkynes can be reduced by the addition of Hz to become alkanes.
Reduction occurs when an organic compound reacts with a reducing
agent. Common reducing agents are lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH,z,
and hydrogen gas over a platinum catalyst, H,/Pt. The symbol [H] is used
to symbolize a reducing agent. As is the case for oxidation, equations
showing the reduction of organic compounds are often left unbalanced.

Hydrolysis Reactions
In a hydrolysis reaction, water adds to a bond, splitting it in two. This
reaction is the reverse of a condensation reaction. For example, water
can add to an ester or amide bond. A carboxylic acid and an alcohol are
produced if an ester bond is hydrolyzed, as shown in the example below.

(b) HoC= CHCH2CH3 + Hz — CH3CH2CH2CH3
(c) CH3sCH(CH3)CH2CH2Br + NaOH — CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH20H + NaBr
Solution
(a) A double bond is formed. One reactant becomes two products.
The organic product has fewer atoms bonded to carbon. Thus,
this reaction is an elimination reaction.
(b) A double bond becomes a single bond. Two reactants become one
product. The organic product has more atoms bonded to carbon.
Thus, this reaction is an addition reaction.
(c) No double bond is broken or formed. Two reactants form two
products. An atom in the organic reactant (Br) is replaced by a
different group of atoms (OH). Thus, this is a substitution reaction.

Reactant: 8 C—H bonds, 2 C—O bonds (or 1 C—O bond)
Product: 9 C—H bonds, 1 C—O bond
The product has gained a C— H bond and Jost a C—O bond. Thus,
this is a reduction.
(b) Count the number of C—H bonds and C — O bonds in the reactant
and in the product. Although the C— H bonds are not shown, you
know that a carbon atom forms a total of four bonds.
Reactant: 11 C—H bonds, 1 C—O bond
Product: 10 C—H bonds, 2 C—O bonds (or 1 C—O bond)
The product has Jost a C— H bond and gained a C—O bond.
Thus, this is an oxidation.

In this section, you will learn how to predict the reactions of different
functional groups. You studied the most common reaction of alkanes,
combustion, in your previous chemistry course. For this reason, the
reactions of alkanes will not be considered here. The reactions of amines
and ethers will be left for a later chemistry course.
Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
Because alkenes and alkynes have reactive double or triple bonds, they
undergo addition reactions. Some common atoms and groups of atoms
that can be added to a double or triple bond include
e H and OH (from H,0)
e H and X (from HX), where X = Cl, Br, or I
e X and X (from X2), where X = Cl, Br, or I
e H and H (from Hz.)
Depending on which atoms are added to the multiple bond, the product
may be an alcohol, alkyl halide, alkane, or alkene (if atoms are added to a
triple bond).
Chapter 2 Reactions of Organic Compounds * MHR-_ 65
Addition to Alkenes
The product of an addition reaction depends on the symmetry of the
reactants. A symmetrical alkene has identical groups on either side of the
double bond. Ethene, CH, CH2, is an example of a symmetrical alkene.
An alkene that has different groups on either side of the double bond is
called an asymmetrical alkene. Propene, CH; CH= CHag, is an example of
an asymmetrical alkene.
The molecules that are added to a multiple bond can also be classified
as symmetrical or asymmetrical. For example, chlorine, Cl,, breaks into
two identical parts when it adds to a multiple bond. Therefore, it is a
symmetrical reactant. Water, HOH, breaks into two different groups (H and
OH) when it adds to a multiple bond, so it is an asymmetrical reactant.
In Figures 2.3 and 2.4, at least one of the reactants is symmetrical.
When one or more reactants in an addition reaction are symmetrical, only
one product is possible.

When both reactants are asymmetrical, however, more than one product
is possible. This is shown in Figure 2.5. The two possible products are
isomers of each other.

(asymmetrical) (asymmetrical)
GETEAEZY The addition of hydrobromic acid to 1-butene
Although both products are possible, 2-bromobutane is the observed
product. This observation is explained by Markovnikov’s rule.
Markovnikov’s rule states that the halogen atom or OH group in an addition
reaction is usually added to the more substituted carbon atom—the carbon
atom that is bonded to the largest number of other carbon atoms. Think of
the phrase “the rich get richer.” The carbon with the most hydrogen atoms
receives even more hydrogen atoms in an addition reaction. According
to Markovnikov’s rule, the addition of two asymmetrical reactants forms
primarily one product. Only a small amount of the other isomer is formed.
The following Sample Problem shows how to use Markovnikov’s rule to
predict the products of addition reactions.

Use Markovnikov’s rule to predict which of the two isomeric products
will form in a greater amount.
Solution
According to Markovnikov’s rule, the hydrogen atom will go to the
double-bonded carbon with the larger number of hydrogen atoms.
Thus, the chlorine atom will go to the other carbon, which has the larger
number of C—C bonds. The product 2-chloro-2-methylpentane will
form in the greater amount. Small amounts of 3-chloro-2-methylpentane
will also form.

Reactions of Aromatic Compounds
As you learned in Chapter 1, aromatic compounds do not react in the
same way that compounds with double or triple bonds do. Benzene’s
stable ring does not usually accept the addition of other atoms. Instead,
aromatic compounds undergo substitution reactions. A hydrogen atom
or a functional group that is attached to the benzene ring may be replaced
by a different functional group. Figure 2.6 shows two possible reactions
for benzene. Notice that iron(III) bromide, FeBr3, is used as a catalyst in
the substitution reaction. An addition reaction does not occur because the
product of this reaction would be less stable than benzene.

Reactions of Alcohols
Alcohols can react in several ways, depending on the reactants and on the
conditions of the reaction. For example, alcohols can undergo substitution
with halogen acids, elimination to form alkenes, and oxidation to form
aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids.
Substitution Reactions of Alcohols
When a halogen acid, such as HCl, HBr, or HI, reacts with an alcohol,
the halogen atom is substituted for the OH group of the alcohol. This is
shown in Figure 2.7(A). The reverse reaction takes place when an alkyl
halide reacts with OH” in a basic solution. See Figure 2.7(B).

B CH;—CH,—Cl + OH- — CH3;—CH,—OH + Cr
(A) Ethanol reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce chloroethane. (B) Ina
basic solution, the reverse reaction takes place. A hydroxide ion reacts with chloroethane
to produce ethanol.
Elimination Reactions of Alcohols
When an alcohol is heated in the presence of the strong acid and
dehydrating agent, H,SO,, an elimination reaction takes place. This type
of reaction is shown in Figure 2.8, on the next page. The OH group and
one H atom leave the molecule, and water is produced. As a result, the
molecule forms a double bond. Because water is produced, this type of
reaction is also called a dehydration (meaning “loss of water’) reaction.

Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones
As you observed in the investigation, different alcohols react differently
with an oxidizing agent. In the same way, aldehydes and ketones react
differently with oxidizing and reducing agents, even though aldehydes
and ketones have similar structures.

As you learned earlier, a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to produce

as H2SOu, is used to catalyze (speed up) the reaction. The reverse reaction
can also occur. (See “Reactions of Esters and Amides,” below.)

carboxylic acid alcohol ester water
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol to form an ester is
called an esterification reaction. An esterification reaction is one type of
condensation reaction. In a similar type of condensation reaction, an
amide can be formed from a carboxylic acid and an amine, but this
process is slightly longer and will not be discussed here.
Carboxylic acids can be reduced to form aldehydes and alcohols.
Reactions of Esters and Amides
Both esters and amides undergo hydrolysis reactions. In a hydrolysis
reaction, the ester or amide bond is cleaved, or split in two, to form two
products. As mentioned earlier, the hydrolysis of an ester produces a
carboxylic acid and an alcohol. The hydrolysis of an amide produces a
carboxylic acid and an amine. There are two methods of hydrolysis: acidic
hydrolysis and basic hydrolysis. Both methods are shown in Figure 2.9.
Hydrolysis usually requires heat. In acidic hydrolysis, the ester or amide
reacts with water in the presence of an acid, such as H2SQOkg. In basic
hydrolysis, the ester or amide reacts with the OH” ion, from NaOH or
water, in the presence of a base. Soap is made by the basic hydrolysis of
ester bonds in vegetable oils or animal fats.

that is used to make plastic bags. Ethene, CH, CHz, is the monomer for
polyethene. Adhesives, rubber, chewing gum, and StyrofoamTM are other

Natural polymers are found in living things. For example, glucose,

Some polymers, both synthetic and natural, can be spun into long,
thin fibres. These fibres are woven into natural fabrics (such as cotton,
linen, and wool) or synthetic fabrics (such as rayon, nylon, and polyester).

Making Synthetic Polymers:
Addition and Condensation Polymerization
Synthetic polymers are extremely useful and valuable. Many polymers
and their manufacturing processes have been patented as corporate
technology. Polymers form by two of the reactions you have already

The name of a polymer is usually written with the prefix poly-

not contain any double bonds? name of the monomer is used, rather than the IUPAC name. For example,
the common name of ethene is ethylene. Polyethene, the polymer
that is made from ethene, is often called polyethylene. Similarly,
the polymer that is made from chloroethene (common name: vinyl
chloride) is named polyvinylchloride (PVC). The polymer that is made
from propene monomers (common name: propylene) is commonly called
polypropylene, instead of polypropene.
Addition polymerization is a reaction in which monomers with
double bonds are joined together through multiple addition reactions
to form a polymer. Figure 2.12 illustrates the addition polymerization
reaction of ethene to form polyethene. Table 2.1, on the next page, gives
the names, structures, and uses of some common polymers that are
formed by addition polymerization.

Condensation polymerization is a reaction in which monomers are joined
together by the formation of ester or amide bonds. A second smaller
product, usually water, is produced by this reaction. For condensation
polymerization to occur, each monomer must have two functional groups
(usually one at each end of the molecule).

Risks of the Polymer Industry
In the 1970s, workers at an American plastics manufacturing plant
began to experience serious illnesses. Several workers died of liver
cancer before the problem was traced to its source: prolonged exposure
to vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride (or chloroethene, C,H;Cl) is used to
make polyvinylchloride (PVC). Unfortunately, vinyl chloride is a
powerful carcinogen. Government regulations have now restricted
workers’ exposure to vinyl chloride. Trace amounts of this dangerous
chemical are still present, however, as pollution in the environment.
The manufacture and disposal of PVC creates another serious
problem. Dioxin, shown in Figure 2.14, is a highly toxic chemical. It is
produced during the manufacture and burning of PVC plastics.

GETTEEATY Dioxin has been shown to be extremely carcinogenic to some animals. As
well, it is suspected of disrupting hormone activity in the body, leading to reduced fertility
and birth defects.
Many synthetic polymers, including most plastics, do not degrade in the
environment. What can be done with plastic and other polymer waste?
One solution may be the development and use of degradable plastics.
These are polymers that break down over time when exposed to
environmental conditions, such as light and bacteria. The Chemistry
Bulletin on the next page gives more information about degradable plastics.
Natural Polymers
Much of our technology has been developed by observing and imitating
the natural world. Synthetic polymers, such as those you just encoun-
tered, were developed by imitating natural polymers. For example, the
natural polymer cellulose provides most of the structure of plants. Wood,
paper, cotton, and flax, are all composed of cellulose fibres. Figure 2.15

Biochemistry is the study of the organic compounds and reactions
that occur in living things. Proteins, starches, and nucleic acids are
important biological polymers. Some biological monomers, like amino
acids and sugars, are biologically important all on their own. You will

conventional plastics require hundreds or even
thousands of years to break down.

Amino Acids and Proteins
A protein is a natural polymer that is composed of monomers called
amino acids. Proteins are found in meat, milk, eggs, and legumes.
Wool, leather, and silk are natural materials that are made of proteins.
Your fingernails, hair, and skin are composed of different proteins.
Proteins carry out many important functions in your body, such as
speeding up chemical reactions (enzymes), transporting oxygen in your
blood (hemoglobin), and regulating your body responses (hormones).
There are 20 common amino acids in the human body. All amino
acids contain a carboxylic acid group and an amino group. Amino acids
can be linked by amide bonds to form proteins. Each amino acid has a
different side chain, which is attached to the centre carbon atom. Figure
2.16, below, shows the structure of an amino acid. The letter G represents
the side chain of the amino acid. Examples of side chains include —CH,
(for the amino acid alanine), —CH,CH,CONH, (for glutamine), and
—CH,OH (for serine).

Glucose is the simplest carbohydrate. It is found in grapes
and corn syrup. Fructose gives fruit its sweet taste. A condensation reaction
between glucose and fructose produces sucrose, commonly called table OH
sugar. Sucrose is found in sugar cane and sugar beets.
90 = MHR- Unit 1 Organic Chemistry
Carbohydrates are found in foods such as bread, pasta, potatoes, and
fruits. They are the primary source of energy for the body. In a process
called cellular respiration, carbohydrates combine with inhaled oxygen
and are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, plus energy. As
shown in Figure 2.18, carbon dioxide and water vapour from cellular
respiration are expelled in your breath.
On a cold day, the water vapour in your breath condenses on contact
with the air, forming a visible cloud.

condensation, because two molecules combine and produce a molecule
of water. During digestion, carbohydrates undergo hydrolysis reactions,
which break the ether bonds between the monomers.
Polysaccharides are polymers that contain many saccharide units.
The most important polysaccharides are those in which glucose is the
monomer. Plants use the glucose polysaccharide cellulose as a structural
material. (See Figure 2.15 for the structure of cellulose.) They store
energy in the starches amylose and amylopectin. A starch is a glucose
polysaccharide that is used by plants to store energy. Humans can digest
starches. Animals store energy in the glucose polysaccharide glycogen,

Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids
Humans and cats both begin life as fertilized eggs, which look fairly
similar. Why does a fertilized cat egg develop into a kitten, while a
fertilized human egg develops into a child (Figure 2.20)? A very special
type of polymer, located in the cell nucleus, directs the formation of the
proteins from which an organism develops.
(GEETSEZT) DNA in the cells of your body direct the production of proteins. Since your
bones, muscles, and organs are built from proteins that are specific to humans, your body
is different from the body of a cat.
DNA (short for 2-deoxyribonucleic acid) is the biological molecule that
determines the shape and structure of all organisms. It is found mostly
in the nuclei of cells. Each strand of DNA is a polymer that is composed
of repeating units, called nucleotides. A single strand of DNA may have
more than one million nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three
parts: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a base.
DNA is one type of nucleic acid. The other type of nucleic acid is
called RNA (short for ribonucleic acid). RNA is present throughout a cell.
It works closely with DNA to produce the proteins in the body. Table 2.3,

A complete molecule of DNA consists of two complementary strands.
These strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases
on the nucleotide units, as shown in Figure 2.21.
DNA has two main functions in the body:
e It replicates itself exactly whenever a cell divides. Thus, every cell in
an organism contains the same information.
e It contains codes that allow each type of protein that is needed by the
body to be made by the body’s cells. RNA assists in this process.
Lipids
The last biological molecules that you will examine in this course are
not polymers. They are, however, very large in size. Lipids are defined
as biological molecules that are not soluble in water, but are soluble in
non-polar solvents, such as benzene and hexanes.
From your previous studies of solubility, you might hypothesize
that lipid molecules must have large hydrocarbon parts, since they are
soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Your hypothesis would be correct.
Lipids contain large hydrocarbon chains, or other large hydrocarbon
structures.
Several types of lipids may be familiar to you. Fats, oils, and some
waxes are examples of lipids. Fats are lipids that contain a glycerol
molecule, bonded by ester linkages to three long-chain carboxylic acids.

esters of long-chain alcohols and long-chain carboxylic acids.
Other lipids include steroids, such as cholesterol, and terpenes,
which are plant oils such as oil of turpentine, or oil of cedar. Figure 2.22
shows the lipid glyceryl trioleate, which is present in olive oil.

Lipids carry out many important functions in the body. Their most
important function is the long-term storage of energy. One gram of fat con-
tains two-and-a-quarter times more energy than a gram of carbohydrate or
protein. When an animal consumes more carbohydrates than are needed
at the time, the body converts the excess carbohydrates to fat. Later, when
insufficient carbohydrates are available for energy, the body may break
down some of these fats to use for energy. Carbohydrates are still needed
in your diet, however, for the proper functioning of your cells.
94. MHR-* Unit 1 Organic Chemistry
In addition to storing energy, lipids have other vital functions:
e Cell membranes are made of a double layer of phospholipids. These
are lipids that are polar at one end and non-polar at the other end.
e Lipids such as cholesterol and testosterone act as hormones to regulate
body functions. (Not all hormones are lipids. Some hormones are
proteins. Other hormones are neither lipids nor proteins.)
e Several vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, and E) are lipids. These
vitamins are known as fat-soluble.
e The fatty tissues in your body are made from lipids. They act like
protective “packaging” around fragile organs, such as the heart. They
insulate the body from excessive heat or cold, and they act as padding
to reduce impact from collisions.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned how to recognize addition and condensation
polymerization reactions. You examined the structures and functions of
several important biological molecules, such as proteins, amino acids,

your daily life. As you know, much of your body is composed of organic
compounds. The food you eat is made from organic compounds, as are the

menthol
GGETEZEI In Chapter 1, you learned about esters that are used as flavourings. Not all
flavourings belong to the ester family. Menthol is an organic compound that is found in the
mint plant. It is used as a flavouring in many substances, including toothpaste, chewing gum,
and cough syrups. What functional group is present in menthol? How might you guess this
from the name?
In this section, you will examine the uses of some common organic
compounds. You will also carry out an analysis of some of the risks and
benefits that are involved in making and using organic compounds.
Risk-Benefit Analysis
How can you make the most informed decision possible when analyzing
the risks or benefits of a product or issue? The following steps are one
way to carry out a risk-benefit analysis for the manufacture and use of an
organic compound.
Step1 Identify possible risks and benefits of the organic product. Ask
questions such as these:
e What are the direct uses of this product? (For example, is it used
as a pharmaceutical drug for a specific disease or condition? Is it
an insecticide for a specific insect “pest”?)
e What are the indirect uses of this product? (For example, is it used
in the manufacture of a different organic or inorganic product?)
e What are the direct risks of making or using this product?
(For example, is the product an environmental pollutant, or does
it contain compounds that may be harmful to the environment?
Can the workers who manufacture this product be harmed by
exposure to it?)
Chapter 2 Reactions of Organic Compounds» MHR_~= 97
e What are the indirect risks of making or using this product? (For
example, are harmful by-products produced in the manufacture
of this product? How much energy does the manufacture of this
product require, and where does the energy come from? What, if
any, side effects does this product cause?)
Step 2 Research the answers to your questions from step 1. Ensure that
your information comes from reliable sources. If there is controversy
on the risks and benefits of the product, find information that covers
both sides of the issue.
Step 3 Decide on your own point of view. In your opinion, are the benefits
greater than the risks? Do the risks outweigh the benefits?
Step 4 Consider possible alternatives that may lessen the risks. Ask
questions such as the following:
e Does a similar, less harmful, product exist?
e Is there a better way to manufacture or dispose of this product?
e What safety precautions can be taken to reduce the risks?
Risks and Benefits of Organic Compounds
The next four tables outline common uses of various organic compounds,
as well as possible complications resulting from each use. The
ThoughtLab that follows provides an opportunity for you to work with
and extend the information in the tables. Of course, the compounds listed
are only a few of the many useful organic compounds that are available to
society.

The First Step Toward the Modern Atomic Model
Chemists needed Dalton’s atomic theory to advance their understanding
of matter and its behaviour during chemical reactions. His atomic model,
however, was inadequate for explaining the behaviour of substances.
For example, Dalton designed a system of symbols to show how atoms
combine to form other substances. Figure 3.2 on the next page shows
several of these symbols. As you will no doubt notice, Dalton correctly
predicted the formulas for carbon dioxide and sulfur trioxide, but ran into
serious trouble with water, ammonia, and methane. Dalton’s attempt at
molecular modelling highlights a crucial limitation with his atomic
model. Chemists could not use it to explain why atoms of elements

The Discovery of the Electron Requires a New Atomic Model
In 1897, Dalton’s idea of an indivisible atom was shattered with a startling
announcement. A British scientist, Joseph John Thomson, had discovered
the existence of a negatively charged particle with mass less than —n
that of a hydrogen atom. This particle was, of course, the electron.
(Later calculations showed that the mass of an electron is eae that
of a hydrogen atom.) It took several years for chemists to consider the
consequences of this discovery. They realized that if atoms contain
electrons, atoms must also contain a positive charge of some kind to
balance the negative charge. The atomic model that Thomson eventually
proposed is shown in Figure 3.3. Keep in mind that scientists had not
yet discovered the proton. Therefore, in this model, the entire sphere
carries a uniform, positive charge.

1908. Greater achievements lay ahead, however.
120 MHR- Unit 2 Structure and Properties
In 1909, two of Rutherford’s students reported observations that cast
doubts on Thomson’s atomic model. As part of ongoing investigations into
the nature and properties of radioactive emissions, they aimed alpha (a)
particles at extremely thin metal foils. A small number of the alpha parti-
cles, about one in every 8000, were deflected significantly by the atoms
that made up the metal foils. These observations were inconsistent with
Thomson’s atomic model. The researchers expected the alpha particles
to pass through the metal atoms with, at most, deflections averaging 555
of a degree. Therefore, deflections of 90° and more strained the credibility
of Thomson’s model. Rutherford encouraged further investigation. Either
the observations and data were flawed, or Thomson’s atomic model was.
As you may recall from earlier studies, the flaw lay in Thomson’s
model. In 1911, Rutherford published the results of the now-famous
gold-foil experiment, shown in Figure 3.4. On the basis of this experi-
ment, Rutherford suggested that the deflections he and his students
observed were caused by an encounter between an alpha particle and
an intense electric field at the centre of the atom.

The experimental hypothesis and design owed much to the contributions of Rutherford's
students, Hans Geiger (of Geiger-counter fame) and Ernest Marsden.
Rutherford performed several calculations that led him to an inescapable
conclusion: the atom is made up mainly of empty space, with a small,
massive region of concentrated charge at the centre. Soon afterward, the
charge on this central region was determined to be positive, and was
named the atomic nucleus. Because Rutherford’s atomic model, shown
in Figure 3.5 on the next page, pictures electrons in motion around an
atomic nucleus, chemists often call this the nuclear model of the atom.

Prelude to a New Atomic Model
Rutherford’s atomic model solved problems inherent in Thomson’s
atomic model, but it also raised others. For example, an atomic nucleus
composed entirely of positive charges should fly apart due to electrostatic
forces of repulsion. Furthermore, Rutherford’s nuclear atom could not

| Figure 3.6 | The electromagnetic spectrum and its properties
The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is called a continuous
spectrum, because the component colours are indistinct. They appear
“smeared” together into a continuum of colour. According to nineteenth-
century physics, part of the energy emitted by electrons should be
observable as a continuous spectrum. This is not, however, the case.
Instead, when atoms absorb energy (for example, when they are exposed
to an electric current), you observe a pattern of discrete (distinct),
coloured lines separated by spaces of varying length. See Figure 3.7. You
can also observe this line spectrum for hydrogen, and for other atoms, in

electron orbits The Bohr Model of the Atom
Scientists of the nineteenth century lacked the concepts necessary to
explain line spectra. Even in the first decade of the twentieth century, a
suitable explanation proved elusive. This changed in 1913 when Niels
nucleus
Bohr, a Danish physicist and student of Rutherford, proposed a new
model for the hydrogen atom. This model retained some of the features of
Rutherford’s model. More importantly, it was able to explain the line spec-
trum for hydrogen because it incorporated several new ideas about energy.
The model of the atom As you can see in Figure 3.8, Bohr’s atomic model pictures electrons in

to simplify some of Bohr's
revolutionary concepts.
The Bohr Atomic Model
1. The atom has only specific, allowable energy levels, called
stationary states. Each stationary state corresponds to the atom’s
electrons occupying fixed, circular orbits around the nucleus.
2. While in one of its stationary states, atoms do not emit energy.
3. An atom changes stationary states by emitting or absorbing a
specific quantity of energy that is exactly equal to the difference
in energy between the two stationary states.
On what basis could Bohr make these claims? In 1900, a physicist named
Max Planck proposed an idea that was so revolutionary that he himself
Web LINK was unwilling to accept its implications. Planck suggested that matter, at
the atomic level, can absorb or emit only discrete quantities of energy.

or lower energy levels is not continuous. It is, rather, quantized.
126 MHR-» Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Look again at the line spectrum for hydrogen shown in Figure 3.7.
The energy that is associated with the coloured lines in this spectrum
corresponds to the change in energy of an electron as it moves to higher
or lower energy levels. For example, when a hydrogen atom is exposed
to electrical current, or to another form of electromagnetic energy, its
electron absorbs photons of energy. The atom is now said to be in an
excited state. Another common way for atoms to become excited is
through atomic collisions. For example, when two hydrogen atoms
collide, some of the kinetic energy from one atom is transferred to the
other atom. The electron of the second hydrogen atom absorbs this energy
and is excited to a higher energy level.
When the electron of a hydrogen atom that has been excited to the
third energy level falls to the second energy level, it emits light of certain
energy. Specifically, an electron that makes a transition from the third
energy level to the second energy level emits a photon of red light with
a wavelength of 656 nm. Because line spectra result when atoms in an
excited state emit photons as they fall to a lower energy level, these
spectra are also called emission spectra.
Figure 3.9 shows the energy transitions that are responsible for the
coloured lines in hydrogen’s emission spectrum. Notice the use of the
symbol n to designate the allowed energy levels for the hydrogen atom:
n=1,n= 2, and so on. This symbol, n, represents a positive integer (such
as 1, 2, or 3), and is called a quantum number. You will learn more about
the significance of quantum numbers in section 3.2.

(shown by the downward-pointing arrows), it emits a photon with a specific wavelength that

Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends» MHR_ 127
Another kind of spectrum that is related to an atom’s emission spec-
trum is an absorption spectrum. This kind of spectrum results when
electrons of atoms absorb photons of certain wavelengths, and so are
excited from lower energy levels to higher energy levels. Figure 3.10
shows the absorption spectrum for hydrogen. As you can see, discrete,
dark lines appear in the precise locations (wavelengths) as those of the
coloured lines in hydrogen’s emission spectrum.
400 nm 500 nm 600 nm 700 nm
GEESERTY When light passes through gaseous hydrogen atoms, the electrons in the
hydrogen atoms absorb photons of red, green, blue, and purple light at specific wavelengths.
When the electrons return to lower energy levels, they re-emit photons with these same
wavelengths. However, most of the photons are emitted in a different direction from the one in
which the electrons absorbed the light. As a result, dark lines appear in the spectrum where
photons of those particular wavelengths are absent.

Bohr’s model was unable, however, to explain the emission spectra
produced by atoms with two or more electrons. Either Bohr’s model was

century developed and modified the atomic model. Changes in this model
resulted from both experimental evidence and new ideas about the nature
of matter and energy. By 1913, chemists and physicists had a working
model that pointed tantalizingly in a promising direction. During the
third decade of the twentieth century, the promise was fulfilled. In the

than the emission spectrum for hydrogen.
It was fairly straightforward to modify Bohr’s model to include the idea
of energy sublevels for the hydrogen spectrum and for atoms or ions with
only one electron. There was a more fundamental problem, however. The
model still could not explain the spectra produced by many-electron
atoms. Therefore, a simple modification of Bohr’s atomic model was not
enough. The many-electron problem called for a new model to explain
spectra of all types of atoms. However, this was not possible until another
important property of matter was discovered.
The Discovery of Matter Waves
By the early 1920s, it was standard knowledge that energy had matter-like
properties. In 1924, a young physics student named Louis de Broglie
stated a hypothesis that followed from this idea. What if, de Broglie
wondered, matter has wave-like properties?
He developed an equation that enabled him to calculate the wave-
length associated with any object — large, small, or microscopic. For
example, a baseball with a mass of 142 g and moving with a speed of
25.0 m/s has a wavelength of 2 x 10-°* m. Objects that you can see and
interact with, such as a baseball, have wavelengths so small that they
do not have any significant observable effect on the object’s motion.
However, for microscopic objects, such as electrons, the effect of wave-
length on motion becomes very significant. For example, an electron
moving at a speed of 5.9 x 10° m/s has a wavelength of 1 x 101° m. The
size of this wavelength is greater than the size of the hydrogen atom to
which it belongs. (The calculated atomic radius of hydrogen is
5.3 x 107?! m.)
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends * MHR-_ 131
De Broglie’s hypothesis of matter waves received experimental
support in 1927. Researchers observed that streams of moving electrons
produced diffraction patterns similar to those that are produced by waves
of electromagnetic radiation. Since diffraction involves the transmission
of waves through a material, the observation seemed to support the idea
that electrons had wave-like properties.
The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom
In 1926, an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger, used mathematics and
statistics to combine de Broglie’s idea of matter waves and Einstein’s idea
of quantized energy particles (photons). Schrédinger’s mathematical
equations and their interpretations, together with another idea called
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (discussed below), resulted in the birth
of the field of quantum mechanics. This is a branch of physics that uses
mathematical equations to describe the wave properties of sub-microscopic
particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. Schrédinger used
concepts from quantum mechanics to propose a new atomic model: the
quantum mechanical model of the atom. This model describes atoms as
having certain allowed quantities of energy because of the wave-like
properties of their electrons.

property given by its mass multiplied by its velocity.) According to this
principle, if you can know an electron’s precise position and path around
the nucleus, as you would by defining its orbit, you cannot know with
certainty its velocity. Similarly, if you know its precise velocity, you
cannot know with certainty its position. Based on the uncertainty
principle, Bohr’s atomic model is flawed because you cannot assign
fixed paths (orbits) to the motion of electrons.
Clearly, however, electrons exist. And they must exist somewhere. To
describe where that “somewhere” is, scientists used an idea from a branch
of mathematics called statistics. Although you cannot talk about electrons
in terms of certainties, you can talk about them in terms of probabilities.
Schrédinger used a type of equation called a wave equation to define the
probability of finding an atom’s electrons at a particular point within the
atom. There are many solutions to this wave equation, and each solution
represents a particular wave function. Each wave function gives informa-
tion about an electron’s energy and location within an atom. Chemists
call these wave functions orbitals.
In further studies of chemistry and physics, you will learn that the
wave functions that are solutions to the Schrédinger equation have no
direct, physical meaning. They are mathematical ideas. However, the
square of a wave function does have a physical meaning. It is a quantity
that describes the probability that an electron is at a particular point
within the atom at a particular time. The square of each wave function
(orbital) can be used to plot three-dimensional probability distribution
graphs for that orbital. These plots help chemists visualize the space in
which electrons are most likely to be found around atoms. These plots are
132 MHR» Unit 2 Structure and Properties
also referred to as electron probability density graphs. Note: Although
orbitals are wave functions without associated physical characteristics
like shape and size, chemists often use the term orbitals when they mean
three-dimensional probability distribution graphs. To simplify discussion,
this textbook will discuss the size and shapes of orbitals. However, what
is really meant is their associated probability distribution graph, which is
calculated using the square of the wave function.
Each orbital has its own associated energy, and each represents
information about where, inside the atom, the electrons would spend
most of their time. Scientists cannot determine the actual paths of the
moving electrons. However, orbitals indicate where there is a high
probability of finding electrons.
Figure 3.14A represents the probability of finding an electron at any
point in space when the electron is at the lowest energy level (n = 1) of a
hydrogen atom. Where the density of the dots is greater, there is a higher
probability of finding the electron. This graph is “fuzzy-looking” because
the probability of finding the electron anywhere in the n = 1 energy
level of a hydrogen atom is never zero. Farther from the nucleus, the
probability becomes very small, but it will still never reach zero.
Therefore, because the shape of the n = 1 orbital for hydrogen represents
the level of probability of finding an electron, and since the probability CONCEPT CHECK
never reaches zero, you have to select a “cut-off” level of probability.

Quantum Numbers and Orbitals
Figure 3.14 showed electron-density probabilities for the lowest energy
level of the hydrogen atom. This is the most stable energy state for
hydrogen, and is called the ground state. The quantum number, n, for a
hydrogen atom in its ground state is 1. When n = 1 in the hydrogen atom,
its electron is associated with an orbital that has a characteristic energy
and shape. In an excited state, the electron is associated with a different
orbital with its own characteristic energy and shape. This makes sense,
because the electron has absorbed energy in its excited state, so its total
energy increases and its motion changes. Figure 3.15 on the next page
compares the sizes of hydrogen’s atomic orbitals when the atom is in its
ground state and when it is in an excited state.
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends * MHR_ 133
Orbitals have a variety of different possible shapes. Therefore,
scientists use three quantum numbers to describe an atomic orbital. One
quantum number, n, describes an orbital’s energy level and size. A second
n=1
quantum number, /, describes an orbital’s shape. A third quantum number,
my, describes an orbital’s orientation in space. These three quantum
numbers are described further below. The Concept Organizer that follows
afterward summarizes this information. (In section 3.3, you will learn
n=2 about a fourth quantum number, m,, which is used to describe the
electron inside an orbital.)
The First Quantum Number:
Describing Orbital Energy Level and Size
The principal quantum number (n) is a positive whole number that

value of n, therefore, may be 1, 2, 3, and so on. A higher value for n

indicates a higher energy level. A higher n value also means that the
between orbital size and quantum
size of the energy level is larger, with a higher probability of finding
number for the hydrogen atom.

increases.
The Second Quantum Number: Describing Orbital Shape
The second quantum number describes an orbital’s shape, and is a posi-
tive integer that ranges in value from 0 to (n — 1). Chemists use a variety
of names for the second quantum number. For example, you may see it
referred to as the angular momentum quantum number, the azimuthal
quantum number, the secondary quantum number, or the orbital-shape
quantum number.
Regardless of its name, the second quantum number refers to the
energy sublevels within each principal energy level. The name that this
book uses for the second quantum number is orbital-shape quantum
number (1), to help you remember that the value of / determines orbital
shape. (You will see examples of orbital shapes near the end of this
section.)
The value of n places precise limits on the value of /. Recall that /
has a maximum value of (n —- 1). So, ifn =1, /=0 (that is, 1 -—1). Ifn = 2,
I may be either 0 or 1. If n = 3, / may be either 0, 1, or 2. Notice that the
number of possible values for / in a given energy level is the same as the
value of n. In other words, if n = 2, then there are only two possible sub-
levels (two types of orbital shapes) at this energy level.
Each value for / is given a letter: s, p, d, or f.
e The / = 0 orbital has the letter s.
e The /=1 orbital has the letter p.
e The / = 2 orbital has the letter d.
e The / = 3 orbital has the letter f.
To identify an energy sublevel (type of orbital), you combine the value
of n with the letter of the orbital shape. For example, the sublevel with
n=3 and/ =O is called the 3s sublevel. The sublevel with n= 2 and/=1
is the 2p sublevel.
134 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure and Properties
There are, in fact, additional sublevels beyond / = 3. However, for
chemical systems known at this time, only the s, p, d, and fsublevels are
required.

For example, if n = 2, it has a total of 4 (that is, 2?) orbitals (an s orbital

(b) What are the possible values for m; ifn =5 and /=1? What kind of

can be described by these quantum numbers?
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends * MHR_ 135
Solution
(a) The allowed values for / are integers ranging from 0 to (n — 1). The
allowed values for m; are integers ranging from —/ to +/ including 0.
Since each orbital has a single m; value, the total number of values
for m; gives the number of orbitals.
To find / from n:
Ifn = 3, / may be either 0, 1, or 2.
To find m; from /:
If/=0,m;=0
If /=1, my may be —1, 0, +1
If/ = 2, m) may be —2, —1, 0, +1, +2
Since there are a total of 9 possible values for m), there are 9 orbitals
when n= 3.
(b) You determine the type of orbital by combining the value for n with
the letter used to identify /. You can find possible values for m; from
/, and the total of the m; values gives the number of orbitals.
To name the type of orbital:

Since n= 5, the quantum numbers represent a 5p orbital.
To find m; from !:
If /=1, my may be —1, 0, +1
Therefore, there are 3 possible 5p orbitals.
Check Your Solution
(a) Since the total number of orbitals for any given n is n*?, when n = 3,
the number of orbitals must be 9 (that is, 32).
(b) The number m values is equivalent to 2/+ 1: 2(1)+1=3. Since the
number of orbitals equals the number of m; values, the answer of 3
must be correct.

136 MHR» Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Shapes of Orbitals
An orbital is associated with a size, a three-dimensional shape, and an
orientation around the nucleus. Together, the size, shape, and position
of an orbital represent the probability of finding a specific electron
around the nucleus of an atom. Figure 3.16 shows the probability shapes
associated with the s, p, and d orbitals. (The f orbitals have been omitted
due to their complexity. You may study these orbitals in post-secondary
school chemistry courses.)
Notice that the overall shape of an atom is a combination of all its
orbitals. Thus, the overall shape of an atom is spherical. Be careful, how-
ever, to distinguish for yourself between the overall spherical shape of the
atom, and the spherical shape that is characteristic of only the s orbitals.
Finally, it is important to be clear about what orbitals are when you
view diagrams such as those in Figure 3.16. Orbitals, remember, are solu-
tions to mathematical equations. Those solutions, when manipulated,
describe the motion and position of the electron in terms of probabilities.
Contour diagrams, such as those shown here and in numerous print and
electronic resources, appear solid. It therefore becomes easy to begin
thinking about orbitals as physical “containers” that are “occupied” by
electrons. In some ways, this is unavoidable. Try to remind yourself,
now and then, of the following:
e Electrons have physical substance. They have a mass that can be
measured, and trajectories that can be photographed. They exist in
the physical universe.
e Orbitals are mathematical descriptions of electrons. They do not have
measurable physical properties such as mass or temperature. They exist
in the imagination.

Section Summary
In this section, you saw how the ideas of quantum mechanics led to a
new, revolutionary atomic model—the quantum mechanical model of
the atom. According to this model, electrons have both matter-like and
wave-like properties. Their position and momentum cannot both be deter-
mined with certainty, so they must be described in terms of probabilities.
An orbital represents a mathematical description of the volume of space
in which an electron has a high probability of being found. You learned
the first three quantum numbers that describe the size, energy, shape,
and orientation of an orbital. In the next section, you will use quantum
numbers to describe the total number of electrons in an atom and the
energy levels in which they are most likely to be found in their ground
state. You will also discover how the ideas of quantum mechanics explain
the structure and organization of the periodic table.

and Periodic Trends
For the hydrogen atom (and other single-electron systems), all orbitals that
have the same value for n have the same energy. You can see this in the
energy level diagram shown in Figure 3.17. Hydrogen’s single electron is
in its lowest (most stable) energy state when it is in the 1s orbital. In other
words, the 1s orbital is the ground state for hydrogen. When a hydrogen
atom is in an excited state, its electron may be found in any of its other
orbitals, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.

Since low energy usually means stability, it is reasonable that the
most stable energy state (ground state) for any atom is one in which its
electrons are in the lowest possible energy level. As you know, this is the
1s orbital (n = 1). However, the electrons of most atoms are not “packed”
into this orbital. In fact, experimental evidence shows that only two atoms
have all their electrons in the 1s orbital: hydrogen and helium. To explain
how and why this is the case, you must consider another property of the
electron.
The Fourth Quantum Number: A Property of the Electron
As you learned from the previous section, three quantum numbers—n, J,
and m;—describe the energy, size, shape, and spatial orientation of an
orbital. A fourth quantum number describes a property of the electron that
results from its particle-like nature. Experimental evidence suggests that
electrons spin about their axes as they move throughout the volume of
their atoms. Like a tiny top, an electron can spin in one of two directions,
each direction generating a magnetic field. The spin quantum number
(m,) specifies the direction in which the electron is spinning. This
quantum number has only two possible values: +2 or —2.
In 1925, an Austrian physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, proposed that only two
electrons of opposite spin could occupy an orbital. This proposal became
known as the Pauli exclusion principle. What the exclusion principle
does is place a limit on the total number of electrons that may occupy any
orbital. That is, an orbital may have a maximum of two electrons only,
each of which must have the opposite spin direction of the other. It may
also have only one electron of either spin direction. An orbital may also
have no electrons at all.

principal n positive integers (1, 2, 3, etc.) | orbital size and energy
orbital-shape integers from 0 to (n — 1) orbital shape
magnetic my integers from —/ to +] orbital orientation
spin Ms + or = electron spin direction
The Pauli Exclusion Principle and Quantum Numbers
Another way of stating the exclusion principle is that no two electrons
in an atom have the same four quantum numbers. This important idea
means that each electron in an atom has its own unique set of four
quantum numbers. For example, compare the quantum numbers
that distinguish a ground state hydrogen atom from a helium atom. (Recall
that a helium atom has two electrons. Note also that m, quantum number
is given as +t. It could just as easily have a value of —t. By convention,
chemists usually use the positive value first.)

Each of a lithium atom’s three electrons also has its own unique set of
quantum numbers, as you can see below. (Assume these quantum
numbers represent a ground state lithium atom.)

Consider the significance of lithium’s quantum numbers. The first two
electrons occupy the 1s orbital, and have the same sets of quantum
numbers as helium’s two electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion
principle, the 1s orbital (n = 1) is now “full” because it contains the
maximum number of electrons: two. For lithium’s third electron, n
cannot equal 1. Therefore, the next principal energy level for the electron
is n= 2. Ifn=2, ] may have a value of 0 or 1. Remember that an atom’s
ground state represents its lowest energy state. Because an orbital with
!=0 (an s orbital) has a lower energy than an orbital with ] = 1
(a p orbital), you would expect a high probability of finding lithium’s
third electron in the s orbital given by n = 2, / = 0. In fact, experimental
evidence supports this expectation. You know that if ] = 0, m; has only
one possible value: 0. Finally, by convention, m, is +4.
It is possible to distinguish atoms by writing sets of quantum numbers
for each of their electrons. However, writing quantum numbers for an
atom such as uranium, which has 92 electrons, would be mind-bogglingly
tedious. Fortunately, chemists have developed a “shortcut” to represent
the number and orbital arrangements of electrons in each atom. As you
will see shortly, these electron configurations, as they are called, are
intimately connected to the structure and logic of the periodic table. CONCEPT CHECK

Nevertheless, it takes time and experience for most people to think
about and talk about atoms in completely quantum mechanical terms. It is
much simpler to think about orbitals as if they have substance. Therefore,
in the text that follows, you will read about electrons “occupying” and
“filling” orbitals. Strictly speaking, this terminology is not scientifically
correct. However, it will help you understand some challenging concepts
more easily.

(GETESERE) Atomic orbitals and their relative energies
Figure 3.19 shows the total number of orbitals in which electrons are
likely to be found for all naturally occurring atoms and most synthetic
atoms. The orbitals, represented by boxes, are listed in order of increasing
energy. You will refer to this diagram often as you learn to write electron
configurations.
An atom’s electron configuration is a shorthand notation that shows
the number and arrangement of electrons in its orbitals. Because the
value of n ranges to infinity, there are an infinite number of electron
configurations that are possible for each atom. For each atom, all but
one of these represent the atom in an excited state. However, an atom’s
chemical properties are mainly associated with its ground state electron
configuration. Therefore, unless stated otherwise, you can assume that
any given electron configuration in this book represents an atom in its
ground state. For example, the ground state electron configuration for a
hydrogen atom is 1s' (pronounced “one ess one”). The superscript 1 indi-
cates that only one electron is in the s orbital. The ground state electron
configuration for a helium atom is 1s? (pronounced “one ess two”), where
the superscript 2 indicates that there are two electrons in the s orbital. For
a lithium atom, it is 1s?2s'. Again, the superscript numbers indicate the
number of electrons in each of the orbitals.
When you are learning to write electron configurations, it is helpful to
start with the first element in the periodic table (hydrogen), and “build
up” the electronic structure of its atom by adding an electron to its lowest
available energy level. Then you move on to the next element (helium) by
adding a proton (and several neutrons) to the nucleus, and by adding an
electron to the appropriate orbital. This imaginary process of building up
the ground state electronic structure for each atom, in order of atomic
number, is called the aufbau principle. (Aufbau comes from a German
word that means “to build up.”)

Writing Electron Configurations
Electron configurations, as they are used in this book, provide information
about the first two quantum numbers, n and J. (Electron configurations
may also reflect the third quantum number, m), but this notation goes
beyond the scope of this chemistry course.) The electron configuration
below represents a boron atom in its ground state.

From the few examples of electron configurations that you have seen so
far, you may have noticed that they do not include information about
the spin direction of the electron. Once you have considered the electron
configurations for a variety of atoms, you will see that you can safely infer
where electrons with opposite spins have been paired together.
There is, however, a system that chemists use alongside electron
configurations to help them plot and keep track of electrons in their
orbitals. An orbital diagram uses a box for each orbital in any given
principal energy level. (Some chemists use a circle or a line instead of
a box.) An empty box | | represents an orbital in which there are no
electrons (an “unoccupied” orbital). A box that has an upward-pointing
arrow represents an orbital with an electron that spins in one
direction. A box with a downward-pointing arrow | | |represents an
orbital with an electron that spins in the opposite direction. You can
probably surmise that a box with oppositely pointing arrows
represents a filled orbital.
You are nearly ready to begin “building up” the electronic structures of
the atoms, using both electron configurations and orbital diagrams. Below
you will find some guidelines to help you. Refer to these guidelines and
to Figure 3.19 as you work your way through the information that follows.
Guidelines for “Filling” Orbitals
1. Place electrons into the orbitals in order of increasing energy level.
2. Each set of orbitals of the same energy level must be completely
filled before proceeding to the next orbital or series of orbitals.
3. Whenever electrons are added to orbitals of the same energy sub-
level, each orbital receives one electron before any pairing occurs.
4. When electrons are added singly to separate orbitals of the same
energy, the electrons must all have the same spin.
Guidelines 3 and 4 together comprise what is known as Hund’s rule.
If you “obey” Hund’s rule, no two electrons can have the same set of
quantum numbers. Thus, this rule follows from Pauli’s exclusion principle.
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends * MHR_ 143
Writing Electron Configurations for Periods 1 and 2
Below are the electron configurations for atoms of the first ten elements,
along with their orbital diagrams.
Figure 3.20 presents the same basic information about the first ten
elements, arranged in the form of the periodic table. Using these electron
configurations, orbital diagrams, and Figure 3.20, you can probably follow
the logic that leads to the electronic structure of each atom. As you
examine and compare this information, note the following.
e The energy of each orbital (or each group of orbitals) increases as you
move from left to right.
e Boron’s fifth electron must go into the 2p energy sublevel. Since / = 1,
my may be -1, 0, or +1. The fifth electron can go into any of these
orbitals, because they all have the same energy. When you draw orbital
diagrams, it is customary to place the electron in the first available box,
from left to right.
e With carbon, you must apply Hund’s rule. In other words, carbon’s sixth
electron must go into the next unoccupied 2p orbital. (Experimental
evidence confirms that the spin of this sixth electron is, in fact, the
same direction as the fifth electron.)
e With oxygen, as with helium’s 1s orbital and beryllium’s 2s orbital, the
last-added (eighth) electron is paired with a 2p electron of opposite
spin. In other words, the Pauli exclusion principle applies.

GETESEZT] How orbitals are filled for atoms of the first 10 elements of the periodic table
Electron Configurations and Orbital Diagrams for Period 3
To write the electron configurations and draw the orbital diagrams for
atoms of Period 3 elements, you follow the same process as for Period 2.
The practice problems below give you the chance to write and draw these
representations. In doing so, you will observe a pattern that enables you to
take a “shortcut” in writing electron configurations. As the atomic number
increases, electron configurations become longer and longer. You know
that chemical reactivity depends mainly on an atom’s valence electrons:
the electrons in the outermost-occupied principle energy level. To
highlight these electrons, you can use a simplified notation called a
condensed electron configuration. This notation places the electron
configuration of the noble gas of the previous period in square brackets,
using its atomic symbol only. Then you continue with the configuration of
the next energy level that is being filled.
The condensed electron configuration for a nitrogen atom, for
example, is [He]2s?2p?. The notation [He] is used to represent 1s”. For a
sodium atom (Z = 11), the condensed electron configuration is [Ne]3s?.
Here, [Ne] represents, 1s?2s?2p®. Be aware that condensed electron
configurations are simply convenient short forms. Thus, [Ne]3s! does not
mean that a sodium atom is the same as a neon atom plus one electron.
Sodium and neon are different elements because the nuclei of their atoms
are completely different.
6. Use the aufbau principle to write complete electron configurations
and complete orbital diagrams for atoms of the following elements:
sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine,
and argon (atomic numbers 11 through 18).
7. Write condensed electron configurations for atoms of these
same elements.

Electron Configurations and Orbital Diagrams for Period 4
You may have noticed that period 3 ended with electrons filling the 3p
energy sublevel. However, when n = 3, / may equal 0, 1, and 2. Perhaps
you wondered what happened to the 3d orbitals (/ = 2).
Electrons do not start occupying 3d orbitals until the 4s orbital is
filled. Therefore, the 3d orbitals are filled starting in period 4. The reason
for this change in the expected orbital filling order is that the 4s orbital
has a lower energy than the 3d orbitals. Remember that usually you fill
orbitals in order of increasing energy. (If necessary, refer to the Guidelines
for “Filling” Orbitals and Figure 3.19 to refresh your memory.)
The chart below shows electron configurations and partial orbital
diagrams for the 18 elements of period 4. You would expect the filling
pattern shown for potassium (Z = 19) through vanadium (Z = 23).
However, an unexpected deviation from the pattern occurs with chromi-
um (Z = 24). The same thing happens with copper (Z = 29). All other
configurations for period 4 conform to the aufbau principle.
Why do Cr and Cu have electron configurations that are different from
what you would predict? The guidelines that you have been using state
that you fill orbitals according to increasing energy. In most cases, this
results in the most stable ground state configuration for the atom.
Experimental evidence indicates, however, that some atoms achieve
greater stability with electron configurations that do not conform to
predicted patterns. For chromium, the greatest ground state stability
results from a configuration in which its 4s and 3d orbitals are half-filled.
For copper, a half-filled 4s orbital and a completely filled set of 3d orbitals
gives the most stable configuration. Similar situations arise for a number
of atoms in the remaining periods.

Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table
So far, you have “built up” atoms of the first 36 elements of the periodic
table. There are more than 80 elements still remaining. You do not,
however, have to build up atoms of these elements to write their electron
configurations. You can do it simply by consulting the periodic table!
All you need is to recognize the significance of several patterns. You have
already observed many of these.
In the process of examining the patterns outlined below, you will
learn the filling order for atoms of elements in periods 5, 6, and 7. You
will also see why the shape and organization of the periodic table is a
direct consequence of the electronic structure of the atoms.
Arranging Elements by Electron Configurations
Figure 3.21 on the next page shows the entire periodic table, with certain
segments colour-coded and labelled according to the type of orbital that
is being filled. If you built up an atom of every element, filling orbitals in
order of increasing energy, you would construct a chart with precisely this
shape and organization. Figure 3.22 highlights the filling order, and there-
fore the energy order, of the orbitals when you read the periodic table
from left to right.
Elements that appear in the s block and the p block are called either
the main group elements or the representative elements. Chemists give
them these names because, collectively, these elements are representative
of a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Among the main
group elements, for example, you will find metals, non-metals, metalloids,
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends » MHR_ 147
highly reactive elements, moderately reactive elements, and unreactive
elements. While most main group elements are solids at room tempera-
ture, roughly one quarter of them are gases, and one is a liquid.
Elements that appear in the d block are called the transition elements.
(GETESEZAT The long form of the They mark the transition from the p orbital filling order to the d orbital
periodic table, with the four energy filling order. By the same reasoning, the f block elements are called

Patterns Involving Group Numbers and Period Numbers
Elements in a group have similar chemical properties because they have
similar outer electron configurations. That is, they have the same number
of valence electrons. This observation gives rise to three patterns that you
can deduce from the periodic table.

energy order of the atomic orbitals. period 6.
e The square of the n value (n’) equals the total number of orbitals in
that energy level. Furthermore, since each orbital may have a maximum
of two electrons, the maximum number of electrons in any principle
energy level is 2n’. For example, with n = 2, there are four orbitals: one
2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. Squaring the n value gives 2* = 4. The
total number of electrons in this energy level is eight, given by 2n?.
Notice that there are eight elements in period 2. This is no coincidence.
Compare this result with the next period. Does the pattern hold? For
period 3 elements, n = 3. The number of orbitals is n? = 9. (Verify that
for yourself.) The number of electrons is 2n? = 18. However, there are
only eight elements in period 3. Why? The 4s orbital has a lower energy
than the 3p orbitals, and thus fills first. The 3d orbitals fill after the 4s
orbitals. Therefore, there are 18 elements in period 4. Recall that the 4f
orbitals do not fill until after the 6s orbital fills.

Electron Configurations, Atomic Properties, and Periodic Trends
Electron configurations—representations of the electronic structure of
atoms—help to determine the atomic and chemical properties of the
elements. Properties such as atomic radius, ionization energy, metallic
character, and electron affinity are periodic. That is, they follow recurring
trends in the periodic table. In a previous chemistry course, you studied
these properties and noted their general trends. With your newly
developed understanding of the periodic table, you are in a position to re-
examine these properties and consider the exceptions to the general
trends. Before doing so, carry out the following ThoughtLab, which

Periodic Trends in Atomic Radius
As you know, atoms are not solid spheres. Their volumes (the extent of
their orbitals) are described in terms of probabilities. Nevertheless, the
size of an atom — its atomic radius — is a measurable property. Chemists
can determine it by measuring the distance between the nuclei of bonded,
neighbouring atoms. For example, for metals, atomic radius is half the
distance between neighbouring nuclei in a crystal of the metal element.
For elements that occur as molecules, which is the case for many non-
metals, atomic radius is half the distance between nuclei of identical
atoms that bonded together with a single covalent bond. In Figure 3.23,
the radii of metallic elements represent the radius of an atom in a metallic
crystal. The radii of all other elements represent the radius of an atom of
the element participating in a single covalent bond with one additional,
like atom.

(Values for atomic radii are given in picometres. Those in parentheses have only two
significant digits.)
152 MHR- Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Figure 3.23 shows the periodic trends associated with the atomic
radius. You can see that atomic radii generally decrease across a period.
Furthermore, atomic radii generally increase down a group. Two factors
affect differences in atomic radii.
One factor affecting atomic radii is changing n. As n increases, there
is a higher probability of finding electrons farther from their nucleus.
Therefore, the atomic volume is larger. In other words, atomic radius
tends to increase with increasing n, and decrease with decreasing n.
The other factor that affects atomic radii is changing nuclear charge —
specifically, the effective nuclear charge. Effective nuclear charge is the
net force of attraction between electrons and the nucleus they surround.
Only hydrogen’s single electron experiences the full positive charge of
its nucleus. For hydrogen, the nuclear charge experienced by the electron
is Z, its atomic number. For all other atoms, the nuclear charge that any
given electron experiences is offset to some degree by other electrons.
Depending on the electron density between the nucleus and any
particular electron, the net force of attraction—the effective nuclear
charge, Zerg — may be large or small.
As Zep increases, electrons are attracted more strongly to the nucleus,
and the size of the atom decreases. As Zs decreases, electrons experience
a reduced force of attraction, and the size of the atom increases. Valence
electrons, especially, experience a smaller Zr than inner electrons
because the inner electrons shield or screen them from the attractive force
of the nucleus.
For the main group elements, the combined influences of n, Ze, and
this shielding effect have the following outcomes.
e n governs the trend of increasing atomic radius down a group. Down a
group, atoms of each subsequent element have one more level of inner
electrons, increasing the shielding effect. Because of the additional
shielding, Z.,¢ for the valence electrons changes only slightly. The
increase in atomic size, therefore, results from the increasing value of n.
e Zor governs the trend of decreasing atomic radius across a period.
Across a period, atoms of each element have one more electron added
to the same outer energy level — n does not change. The shielding effect
changes only slightly. However, Ze changes considerably. The decrease
in atomic size across a period, therefore, results from increasing Zosr.
The atoms of transition elements do not display the same general trend as
the main group elements. A key reason for this is that electrons are added
to inner energy levels — the d orbitals — rather than to the outer energy
levels. As a result, Zee changes relatively little, so atomic size remains

explanation for the atomic radii of transition-element atoms.
Periodic Trends in lonization Energy
For the hydrogen atom, the difference in energy between n = 1 and n = co
represents the energy change associated with the complete removal of its
electron. (By convention, when n = oo, an electron is considered to be
completely removed from its atom.) The energy needed to completely
remove one electron from a ground state gaseous atom is called the
ionization energy. Energy must be added to the atom to remove an
electron in order to overcome the force of attraction exerted on the
electron by the nucleus. Since multi-electron atoms have two or more
electrons, they also have more than one ionization energy.
Chapter 3 Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends * MHR_ 153
A gaseous atom’s first ionization energy is the least energy required to
remove an electron from the outermost occupied energy level. The second
ionization energy is always greater than the first ionization energy,
because the electron must be removed from a positively charged ion. The
same reasoning applies for successive ionization energies.
First ionization energy (IE,) is closely linked to an atom’s chemical
reactivity. Atoms with a low IE, tend to form cations during chemical reac-
tions. Notice in Figure 3.24 that the atoms with the lowest IE, are those
belonging to group 1 elements. These elements, also known as the alkali
metals, are among the most reactive elements in the periodic table. Atoms
of elements with high IE, tend to form anions: negatively charged ions.
(A notable exception is the noble gases, which do not form ions naturally.)

involving first ionization energy Atomic number
Figure 3.24 illustrates several trends associated with ionization energy.
e Ionization energy generally decreases down a group. Notice that this
trend is the inverse of the trend for atomic radius. The two trends are,
in fact, linked. As atomic radius increases, the distance of valence
electrons from the nucleus also increases. There is a decrease, therefore,
in the force of attraction exerted by the nucleus on the valence
electrons. Thus, less energy is needed to remove one such electron.
e Ionization energy generally increases across a period. Again, this trend
is linked to the atomic radius. Across a period, the atomic radius
decreases because Zerrp increases. The force of attraction between the
nucleus and valence electrons is subsequently increased. Therefore,
more energy is needed to remove one such electron.
Several minor variations in these trends occur. The variations involve
boron and aluminum in group 13 (IIIA) and oxygen and sulfur in group 16
(VIA). The drop in IE; with group 13 occurs because electrons start to fill
the np orbitals. These orbitals are higher in energy than the ns orbital, so
the additional electron is more easily removed. Group 16 marks the first
pairing of the p orbital electrons. The np* configuration of nitrogen is
more stable than the np* configuration of oxygen. Electron repulsions
154 MHR »« Unit 2 Structure and Properties
increase the orbital energy in oxygen. Therefore, less energy is required to
remove the fourth p sublevel electron in oxygen.
Periodic trends in ionization energy are linked to trends involving the
reactivity of metals. In general, the chemical reactivity of metals increases
down a group and decreases across a period. These trends, as well as a
further trend from metallic to non-metallic properties across a period, and
increasing metallic properties down a group, are shown in Table 3.1.

Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity
Electron affinity is the change in energy that occurs when an electron is
added to a gaseous atom. As was the case with ionization energy, there is
more than one value for electron affinity. The first electron affinity results
in the formation of an anion with a charge of 1-. For example, when a
neutral fluorine atom acquires an electron, as in a bonding situation,
the resulting electron configuration of the fluoride ion is the same as that
of the noble gas, neon:
F (1s72s?2p°) + e@ > F (1s72s?2p®) AE = EA,
Fluorine is a highly reactive element. The relative ease with which
it gains an electron when it forms bonds is reflected in its high
electron affinity.

GEEISESZY Electron affinities for the main group elements. Negative values mean that
anions form with the release of energy. Positive values mean that energy is absorbed in order
to form the anion. The positive values are estimated, because the anions formed for atoms of
groups 2 and 18 are unstable.
Figure 3.25 shows electron affinities for atoms of the main group ele-
ments. Positive values mean that energy is required to add an electron.
Negative values mean that energy is given off when an electron is added.
High negative numbers mean a high electron affinity. Low negative num-
bers and positive numbers mean a low electron affinity.
Trends for electron affinity are more irregular than those for atomic
radius and ionization energy, because factors other than atomic size and
Zeft are involved. In future chemistry courses, you will learn about these
factors and how they explain the irregularities. However, the property of
electron affinity is still significant when you consider it in combination
with ionization energy. The trends that result from this combination are
important for chemical bonding.
e Atoms of elements in group 17 (VIIA), and to a lesser degree group 16
(VIA), have high ionization energies and high electron affinities. As
a result, it takes a great deal of energy to remove electrons from these
atoms. However, these atoms attract electrons strongly, and form
negative ions in ionic compounds.
156 MHR-» Unit 2 Structure and Properties
e Atoms of elements in group 1 (IA) and group 2 (IIA) have low ionization
energies and low electron affinities. Atoms of these elements give up
electrons easily, but attract them poorly. Therefore, they form positive
ions in ionic compounds.
e Atoms of elements in group 18 (VIIA) have very high ionization ener-
gies and very low electron affinities. Therefore, in nature, they do not
gain, give up or share electrons at all. (Under laboratory conditions,
only the larger group 18 atoms can be made to form compounds.)
Section Summary
In this section, you have seen howa theoretical idea, the quantum
mechanical model of the atom, explains the experimentally determined
structure of the periodic table, and the properties of its elements. Your
understanding of the four quantum numbers enabled you to write electron
configurations and draw orbital diagrams for atoms of the elements. You
also learned how to “read” the periodic table to deduce the electron con-
figuration of any element.
Since the start of high school science courses, you have used the
periodic table to help you investigate the composition and behaviour of
the elements. Your early experiences with the periodic table were limited
largely to the first 20 elements, because you could explain their electron
structure without the concepts of orbitals and electron configurations.
The modern, quantum mechanical model of the atom has broadened
your understanding of the elements, the composition of their atoms,
and their chemical and physical behaviour in the world around you.
You will draw upon these concepts in the next chapter, as you expand
your understanding of the forces that are responsible for the millions of
kinds of matter in the universe: chemical bonds.

4.3 Intermolecular Forces Why does the shape of a molecule matter? To answer this question,
in Liquids and Solids consider that, right now, each nerve cell in your brain is communicating
with adjacent nerve cells by releasing molecules called neurotransmitters
from one cell to the next. Enzymes are assisting in the chemical break-
down of food in your digestive system. The aroma of cologne, desk wood,
or cleansers that you may be smelling is a result of odorous molecules
migrating from their sources to specific sites in your nasal passages.
Each of these situations depends on the ability of one molecule with a
specific shape to “fit” into a precise location with a corresponding shape.
The properties of substances derive from the ways in which particles
bond together, the forces that act within and among the compounds they
form, and the shapes that result from these interactions.

molecules and the simplest formula unit of an ionic solid. Drawing a
Lewis structure for a molecule lets you see exactly how many electrons
are involved in each bond, and helps you to keep track of the number of
valence electrons. In the example below, notice that there are two ways
to show the bonding pairs of electrons. Some chemists use dots only.
Other chemists show the bonding pairs as lines between atoms. Dots are
reserved for representing a Jone pair (a non-bonding pair) of electrons.
You will see the second example, with lines for bonding pairs, used more
often in this textbook.

lonic Bonding
The force of attraction between oppositely charged ions (cations and
anions) constitutes an ionic bond. Ionic bonding occurs between atoms
of elements that have large differences in electronegativity — usually a
metal with a very low electronegativity and a non-metal with a very high
electronegativity. The units of ionic compounds such as sodium chloride
and magnesium fluoride cannot be separated easily by direct heating of the
crystal salts. The ions that make up the ionic solid are arranged in a specif-
ic array of repeating units. In solid sodium chloride, for example, the ions
are arranged in a rigid lattice structure. In such systems, the cations and
anions are arranged so that the system has the minimum possible energy.
| Figure 4.1, A repeating unitina
Because of the large differences in electronegativity, the atoms in an
magnesium fluoride crystal
ionic compound usually come from the s block metals and the p block
non-metals. For example, magnesium in Group 2 (ITA) and fluorine in
Group 17 (VIIA) combine to form the ionic compound magnesium
fluoride, MgF2. Figure 4.1 shows a repeating unit in the crystal model
of magnesium fluoride. The process that results in the formation of ions
can be illustrated with an orbital diagram or with Lewis structures, as
shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. Use them as a guide for the Practice
Problems below. Through bonding, the atoms of each element obtain a
valence electron configuration like that of the nearest noble gas. In this
case, the nearest noble gas for both ions is neon. This observation reflects

Properties of lonic Solids
Magnesium fluoride has many properties that are characteristic of ionic
solids. In general, ionic solids have the following properties:
e crystalline with smooth, shiny surfaces
e hard but brittle
e non-conductors of electricity and heat
e high melting points
Many ionic solids are also soluble in water. Magnesium fluoride, however,
is an exception. It has a very low solubility in water.
Lattice Energy and lonic Bonding
The reaction between gaseous magnesium ions and gaseous fluorine ions
is highly exothermic. Chemists have determined that 2957 kJ of energy is
released when 1 mol of Mg**) and 2 mol of F%) react to form 1 mol of
the stable ionic solid, MgF>.
The amount of energy given off when an ionic crystal forms from the
gaseous ions of its elements is called the lattice energy. Thus, the lattice
energy of MgF. is 2957 kJ/mol. The same amount of energy must be
added to break the ionic crystal back into its gaseous ions. What is the
relationship between lattice energy and the formation of an ionic bond?
For example, when solid magnesium and gaseous fluorine react to form
magnesium fluoride, the energy change is 1123 kJ/mol. How does this
energy change relate to magnesium fluoride’s lattice energy of 2957 kJ/mol?
Remember that, in general, the lower the total energy of a system is,
the higher is its stability. Any process that requires the addition of energy

between the ions? For magnesium fluoride, the overall decrease in energy of 1123 kJ/mol
is accounted for mainly by its large lattice energy. The lattice energies
of the magnesium halides decrease from fluoride to iodide. The melting
points of these halides reveal a trend in the same direction, with magne-
sium fluoride having the highest melting point and magnesium iodide
having the lowest melting point. In other words, the compound with the
largest lattice energy has the highest melting point—it requires the most
energy to disrupt the lattice structure.

Covalent Bonding electron
Covalent bonding involves a balance between the forces of attraction
nucleus
and repulsion that act between the nuclei and electrons of two or
more atoms. This idea is represented in Figure 4.4, with a molecule of
hydrogen, Hz. There is an optimum separation for two hydrogen atoms
at which their nucleus-electron attractions, nucleus-nucleus repulsions,
and electron-electron repulsions achieve this balance. This optimum
separation favours a minimum energy for the system, and constitutes the
covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms. Unlike ionic bonding,
in which electrons behave as if they are transferred from one atom to
another, covalent bonding involves the sharing of pairs of electrons. optimum
separation
In Chapter 3 you learned how the quantum mechanical model applies
to the atom. The model can also be extended to explain bonding. A Covalent bonding
covalent bond may form when two half-filled atomic orbitals from two involves forces of attraction and
atoms overlap to share the same region of space. A covalent bond involves repulsion that occur simultaneously.
the formation of a new orbital, caused by the overlapping of atomic
orbitals. The new orbital has energy levels that are lower than those of
the original atomic orbitals. Since electrons tend to occupy the lowest
available energy level, the new orbitals provide a more energetically
favourable configuration than the two atoms had before they interacted.
Characteristics of Covalent Bonding
In many cases, electron-sharing enables each atom in a covalent bond to
acquire a noble gas configuration. For a hydrogen molecule, each atom
acquires a filled valence level like that of helium by treating the shared
pair of electrons as if it is part of its own composition. As you can see in
Figure 4.5, a single shared pair of electrons—a bonding pair—fills the region of increased

valence level of both hydrogen atoms at the same time.
The period 2 non-metals from carbon to fluorine must fill their 2s and
their three 2p orbitals to acquire a noble gas configuration like that of
neon. Covalent bonding that involves these elements obeys the octet rule.
In the formation of the diatomic fluorine molecule, F,, for example, the
bonding (shared) pair of electrons gives each fluorine atom a complete

Bond energy is the energy required to break the force of attraction
between two atoms in a bond and to separate them. Thus, bond energy
is a measure of the strength of a bond. You might expect that the bond
energy would increase if more electrons were shared between two atoms
because there would be an increase in charge density between the nuclei
of the bonded atoms. In other words, you might predict that double bonds
are stronger than single bonds, and that triple bonds are stronger than
double bonds. The data in Table 4.1 support this prediction.

between the bonding atoms to predict the type of bond. For example,
two atoms with identical electronegativities, such as chlorine

covalently. When two atoms have very different electronegativities, the

atom with the higher electronegativity value attracts electrons more

chloride, for instance, chlorine (EN = 3.16) attracts an electron much

very low probability of being found near sodium. A high electronegativity

Metallic Bonding
About two-thirds of all the naturally occurring elements are metals.
Despite this great diversity, metals have many properties in common.
Metals conduct electricity and heat in both their solid and liquid states.
Most metals are malleable and ductile; that is, they can be easily stretched,
bent, and deformed without shattering of the whole solid, or can be easily
made to be with the addition of heat or pressure. While metals show a
broad range of melting and boiling points, in general, metals change state
at moderate to high temperatures. Most metals have either one or two
valence electrons. What kind of bonding model can account for these
properties?
Based on electronegativity differences, you would not expect metals
to form ionic bonds with themselves or with other metals—and they do
not. Similarly, metals do not have a sufficient number of valence electrons
to form covalent bonds with one another. Metals do, however, share
electrons. Unlike the electron sharing in covalent compounds, however,
electron sharing in metals occurs throughout the entire structure of the
metal. The free-electron model shown in Figure 4.8 pictures metals as
being composed of a densely packed core of metallic cations, within a
delocalized region of shared, mobile valence electrons. The force of
attraction between the positively charged cations and the pool of valence
electrons that moves among them constitutes a metallic bond.
Properties Explained by the Free-Electron Model
The free-electron model explains many properties of metals. For example:
e Conductivity: Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat because
electrons can move freely throughout the metallic structure. This freedom
of movement is not possible in solid ionic compounds, because the
valence electrons are held within the individual ionic bonds in the lattice.
e Malleability and Ductility: The malleability of metals can be explained

defined point of stress. The delocalized electrons continue to exert a
uniform attraction on the positive ions, as you can see in Figure 4.9.
e Melting and Boiling Points: The melting and boiling points of Group 1
(IA) metals (with an s’ electron in their condensed electron configura-
tion) are generally lower than the melting and boiling points of Group 2
(IIA) metals (with an s? in their condensed electron configuration).
You would expect this trend, because the greater number of valence
electrons and the larger positive charge of Group 2 (IIA) atoms result in
stronger metallic bonding forces. This trend is also consistent with the
fact that Group 2 metals are smaller in size than Group 1 metals. Trends
involving the transition metals are more complex, in part because they
have a greater number of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. Because
these d electrons and those of the valence energy level have similar
magnitudes, the d electrons can participate in metallic bonding. In
general, however, transition elements have very high melting and
boiling points.
Section Summary
In this section, you have used Lewis structures to represent bonding in
ionic and covalent compounds, and have applied the quantum mechani-
cal theory of the atom to enhance your understanding of bonding. All
chemical bonds—whether their predominant character is ionic, covalent,
or between the two—result from the atomic structure and properties of
the bonding atoms. In the next section, you will learn how the positions of
atoms in a compound, and the arrangement of the bonding and lone pairs
of electrons, produce molecules with characteristic shapes. These shapes,
and the forces that arise from them, are intimately linked to the physical
properties of substances, as you will see in the final section of the chapter.

Lewis structures.
How To Draw Lewis Structures for Simple Molecules and lons with
a Central Atom
Step1 Position the least electronegative atom in the centre of the
molecule or polyatomic ion. Write the other atoms around this
central atom, with each atom bonded to the central atom by a
single bond. Always place a hydrogen atom or a fluorine atom
at an end position in the structure.
Step 2 (a) Determine the total number of valence electrons in the
molecule or ion. For polyatomic ions, pay close attention
to the charge. For example, if you are drawing a polyatomic
anion such as CO,”, add two electrons to the total number
of valence electrons calculated for the structure CO3. For a
polyatomic cation such as NH,*, subtract one electron from
the total number of valence electrons calculated for the
structure NH,.
(b) Once you have the total number of valence electrons,
determine the total number of electrons needed for each
atom to achieve a noble gas electron configuration.
Chapter 4 Structures and Properties of Substances * MHR_ 173
(c) Subtract the first total (number of valence electrons) from the
second total (number of electrons needed to satisfy the octet
rule) to get the number of shared electrons. Then divide this
number by 2 to give the number of bonds. Double or triple
bonds may be needed to account for this number of bonds.
Double bonds count as two bonds. Triple bonds count as
three bonds.
Step 3 Subtract the number of shared electrons from the number of
valence electrons to get the number of non-bonding electrons.
Add these electrons as lone pairs to the atoms surrounding
the central atom so that you achieve a noble gas electron
configuration for each atom.
Drawing the Lewis Structure of a Molecule
Problem
Draw the Lewis structure for formaldehyde (methanal), CH20.
Solution
The molecular formula, CH,O, tells you the number of each kind
of atom in the molecule. Following steps 1 to 3 from the procedure
outlined above:
Step 1 Since H is always placed at the end position and C is less
electronegative than O, C should be the central atom. Place
the other atoms around C, attached by single bonds.
O
H—C—H
Step 2 Determine the total number of valence electrons:
(1 C atom x 4 e/C atom) + (1 O atom x 6 e/O atom)
+ (2 H atoms x 1 e /H atom)
=4e +6e +2e€
=12¢e
Then, determine the total number of electrons required for each
atom in the structure to achieve a noble gas configuration. This
would be 8 e for C and 8 e for O (to fill their respective valence
energy levels) and 2 e for each H (to fill its 1s orbital). So the total
number for CH20O is:
(2 atoms x 8 e /atom) + (2 atoms x 2 e /atom) = 20 e&
To find the number of shared electrons, subtract the first total
from the second,
20e -—12e =8e
Now divide the number of shared electrons by two to obtain the
number of bonds.
20e —12e =8e +2=4 covalent bonds
Since there are only three atoms surrounding the central atom,
you can infer that one of the bonds is likely a double bond.

Step 3 Determine the number of non-bonding electrons by subtracting
the number of shared electrons from the total number of valence
electrons:
12 valence electrons — 8 shared electrons
= 4 non-bonding valence electrons (that is, 2 lone pairs)
Since H can only form a single bond, a possible structure is:

Check Your Solution
Each atom has achieved a noble gas electron configuration. Thus,
you can be confident that this is a reasonable Lewis structure.

Co-ordinate Covalent Bonds
You know that a covalent bond involves the sharing of a pair of electrons
between two atoms; each atom contributes one electron to the shared pair.
In some cases, such as the hydronium ion, H3;0*, one atom contributes
both of the electrons to the shared pair. The bond in these cases is called
a co-ordinate covalent bond. In terms of the quantum mechanical model, a
co-ordinate covalent bond forms whena filled atomic orbital overlaps with
an empty atomic orbital. Once a co-ordinate bond is formed, it behaves in
the same way as any other single covalent bond. The next Sample Problem
involves a polyatomic ion with a co-ordinate covalent bond.

Each atom has achieved a noble gas electron configuration. The positive
charge on the ion is included. This is a reasonable Lewis structure for
NH,*.
Note that the Lewis structure for NH,* does not indicate which atom
provides each shared pair of electrons around the central nitrogen atom.
However, the quantum mechanical model of the atom can explain the
bonding around this nitrogen atom. The condensed electron configuration
for nitrogen is [Ne] 2s?2p*. Each nitrogen atom has only three unpaired
2p electrons in three half-filled orbitals available for bonding. Since there
are four covalent bonds shown around nitrogen in the Lewis structure,
electrons in one of the bonds must have come from the filled orbitals of
nitrogen. Therefore, one of the bonds around the central nitrogen atom
must be a co-ordinate covalent bond.
Resonance Structures: More Than One Possible Lewis Structure
Imagine that you are asked to draw the Lewis structure for sulfur dioxide,
SO,. A typical answer would look like this:
:O—S=0:
This Lewis structure suggests that SO, contains a single bond and
a double bond. However, experimental measurements of bond lengths
indicate that the bonds between the S and each O are identical. The two
bonds have properties that are somewhere between a single bond and a
double bond. In effect, the SO, molecule contains two “one-and-a-half”
bonds.
To communicate the bonding in SO, more accurately, chemists
draw two Lewis structures and insert a double-headed arrow between
them. Each of these Lewis structures is called a resonance structure.
Resonance structures are models that give the same relative position of
atoms as in Lewis structures, but show different places for their bonding
and lone pairs.
176 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Many molecules and ions—especially organic ones—require
resonance structures to represent their bonding. It is essential to bear
in mind, however, that resonance structures do not exist in reality. For
example, SO; does not shift back and forth from one structure to the
other. An actual SO, molecule is a combination—a hybrid—of its two
resonance structures. It is more properly referred to as a resonance hybrid.
You could think of resonance hybrids as being like “mutts.” For example,
a dog that is a cross between a spaniel and a beagle (a “speagle”) is part
spaniel and part beagle. It does not exist as a spaniel one moment and a
beagle the next. Instead, a speagle is an average, of sorts, between the two
breeds. Similarly, a resonance hybrid is a weighted average between two
or more resonance structures.

Central Atoms with an Expanded Valence Level
The octet rule allows a maximum of four bonds (a total of eight electrons)
to form around an atom. Based upon bond energies, however, chemists
have suggested that the bonding in some molecules (and polyatomic ions)
is best explained by a model that shows more than eight electrons in the
valence energy level of the central atom. This central atom is said to have
an expanded valence energy level. One example of a molecule with an
expanded valence energy level is phosphorus pentachloride, PCl;. This
substance is a pungent, pale-yellow powder that is used in the agricultural,
pharmaceutical, and dyeing industries. Organic chemists also use reactions
with PC]; to identify compounds that contain hydroxyl groups.

Until recently, chemists explained bonding in molecules such as PCI5
by assuming that empty d orbitals of the central atom were involved.
However, experimental evidence does not support this idea. Current
thinking suggests that larger atoms can accommodate additional valence
electrons because of their size. The theory behind this idea goes beyond
the scope of this textbook. Assume that the octet rule usually applies
when drawing Lewis structures for simple molecules. Sometimes,
however, you must violate the rule to allow for more than four bonds

Shapes and Polarity of Molecules
Up to now, you have represented molecules using Lewis structures.
These two-dimensional, formula-like diagrams help you count and keep
track of valence electrons, and communicate essential information about
the placement and bonding of atoms or ions in a molecule. Chemists often
draw Lewis structures in a way that suggests the shape of a molecule.
However, this is not their function. It is important to remember that Lewis
structures do not communicate any information about a molecule’s shape.
To represent the shapes of real molecules, you need a model that depicts
them in three-dimensions.
In 1957, an English chemist, Ronald Gillespie, joined Hamilton,
Ontario’s McMaster University for a long, distinguished career as a
professor of chemistry. Earlier that year, Gillespie, in collaboration with
a colleague, Ronald Nyholm, developed a model for predicting the shape
of molecules. Like chemistry students around the world since that time,
you are about to learn the central features of this model, called the
Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion theory. This is usually abbreviated
to VSEPR (pronounced “vesper”) theory. (Note that some chemists use the
term “shell” instead of energy level to describe atomic orbitals.)
Introducing Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory
The fundamental principle of the Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion
theory is that the bonding pairs and lone, non-bonding pairs of electrons
in the valence level of an atom repel one another. As you know, electron
pairs of atoms are localized in orbitals, which are shapes that describe the
space in which electrons are most likely to be found around a nucleus.
The orbital for each electron pair is positioned as far apart from the other
orbitals as possible.
178 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure and Properties
The effect of this positioning minimizes the forces of repulsion
between electron pairs. A lone pair (LP) will spread out more than a bond
pair. Therefore, the repulsion is greatest between lone pairs (LP— LP).
Bonding pairs (BP) are more localized between the atomic nuclei, so they
spread out less than lone pairs. Therefore, the BP-BP repulsions are smaller
than the LP—LP repulsions. The repulsion between a bond pair and a
lone-pair (BP—LP) has a magnitude intermediate between the other two.
In other words, in terms of decreasing repulsion:
LP—LP > LP—BP > BP—BP.
In Unit 1, you encountered the tetrahedral shape around a single-
bonded carbon atom, the trigonal planar shape around a carbon atom
with one double bond, and the linear shape around a carbon atom with
a triple bond. These shapes result from repulsions between lone pairs
and bonding pairs of electrons. Now you will use your understanding of
LP and BP repulsions to explain the shapes you learned in Unit 1, and
to predict the shapes of other molecules. Figure 4.11 shows the five basic
geometrical arrangements that result from the interactions of lone pairs
and bonding pairs around a central atom. These arrangements involve up
to six electron groups. An electron group is usually one of the following:
e a single bond
e a double bond
e a triple bond
e a lone pair
Each of the electron-group arrangements in Figure 4.11 results in a
minimum total energy for the molecule. Variations in these arrangements
are possible, depending on whether a bonding pair or a lone pair occupies
a specific position. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
electron-group arrangement and molecular shape. Electron-group
arrangement refers to the ways in which groups of valence electrons
are positioned around the central atom. Molecular shape refers to the
relative positions of the atomic nuclei in a molecule. When all the
electron groups are bonding pairs, a molecule will have one of the five
geometrical arrangements shown in Figure 4.11. If one or more of the
electron groups include a lone pair of electrons, variations in one of the
five geometric arrangements result.

determine that the central atom has an expanded valence level.
Total number of valence electrons = 36 e-

The Relationship Between Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity
A molecule’s shape and polarity are directly related. As you know, the
electronegativity difference between two atoms is the principal factor
that determines the type of chemical bonding between them. As you saw
in section 4.1, when atoms of two different elements have AEN between
0.5 and 1.7, the bond between them is polar covalent. The electrons are
shared unequally between the two types of atoms. For example, in the
HCl molecule, the Cl atom is more electronegative than the H atom. Thus,
the Cl atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the shared pair of
electrons. As a result, the Cl end of the bond develops a partial negative
charge (6°) and the H end develops a partial positive charge (6*). This
polarity in a bond is called a bond dipole. The vector used to represent a
bond dipole points toward the more electronegative element. For exam-
ple, you could represent the polarity of the bond in hydrogen chloride as:
* 8 to
H: Cl: or HCI
For a diatomic molecule such as HCl, or the bond polarity is also the
molecule’s polarity. For polyatomic molecules, such as the examples that
follow, molecular polarity depends on the polarity of all of the bonds and
the angles at which the dipoles come together. Thus, molecular
dipo—l oer just dipole—is a term used to describe the charge separation
for the entire molecule.
Consider, for example, BeF:, which is a symmetrical, linear molecule.
Each Be—F bond is polar (because fluorine has a greater electronegativity
than beryllium). Due to the linear shape of this molecule, however,
the polarities of the two bonds are directly opposite each other. The
two bonding polarities exactly counteract each other, so that BeF, is a
non-polar molecule. The shape of a molecule, combined with the polarity
of its individual bonds, therefore, determine polarity.

In the liquid state, polar molecules (dipoles) orient themselves so that
oppositely charged ends of the molecules are near to one another. The
attractions between these opposite charges are called dipole-dipole forces.
Figure 4.13 shows the orientation of polar molecules due to these forces
in a liquid.

such as water because of ion-dipole forces. An ion-dipole force is the
force of attraction between an ion and a polar molecule (a dipole). For
example, NaCl dissolves in water because the attractions between the Nat
and Cl ions and the water molecules provide enough energy to overcome
the forces that bind the ions together. Figure 4.14 shows how ion-dipole
forces dissolve any type of soluble ionic compound.
» @ ae |
In aqueous solution, ionic solids dissolve as the negative ends and the positive
ends of the water molecules become oriented with the corresponding oppositely charged ions
that make up the ionic compound, pulling them away from the solid into solution.
Induced Intermolecular Forces
Induction of electric charge occurs when a charge on one object causes a
change in the distribution of charge on a nearby object. Rubbing a balloon
to make it "stick" to a wall is an example of charging by induction. There
are two types of charge-induced dipole forces.
An ion-induced dipole force results when an ion in close proximity
to a non-polar molecule distorts the electron density of the non-polar
molecule. The molecule then becomes momentarily polarized, and the
two species are attracted to each other. This force is active during every
moment of your life, in the bonding between non-polar Oz molecules
and the Fe** ion in hemoglobin. Ion-induced dipole forces, therefore, are
part of the process that transports vital oxygen throughout your body.
A dipole-induced dipole force is similar to that of an ion-induced
dipole force. In this case, however, the charge on a polar molecule is
responsible for inducing the charge on the non-polar molecule. Non-polar
gases such as oxygen and nitrogen dissolve, sparingly, in water because of
dipole-induced dipole forces.
Chapter 4 Structures and Properties of Substances * MHR_ 191
Dispersion (London) Forces
The shared pairs of electrons in covalent bonds are constantly vibrating.
While this applies to all molecules, it is of particular interest for mole-
cules that are non-polar. The bond vibrations, which are part of the
normal condition of a non-polar molecule, cause momentary, uneven
distributions of charge. In other words, a non-polar molecule becomes
slightly polar for an instant, and continues to do this on a random but
on-going basis. At the instant that one non-polar molecule is in a slightly
polar condition, it is capable of inducing a dipole in a nearby molecule.
An intermolecular force of attraction results. This force of attraction is
called a dispersion force. Chemists also commonly refer to it as a London
force, in honour of the German physicist, Fritz London, who studied
this force. Unlike other intermolecular forces, dispersion (London)
forces act between any particles, polar or otherwise. They are the main
intermolecular forces that act between non-polar molecules, as shown in
Figure 4.15.
Two factors affect the magnitude of dispersion forces. One is the
number of electrons in the molecule and the other is the shape of the
molecule. Vibrations within larger molecules that have more electrons
than smaller molecules can easily cause an uneven distribution of charge.
The dispersion forces between these larger molecules are thus stronger,
which has the effect of raising the boiling point for larger molecules. A
molecule with a spherical shape has a smaller surface area than a straight
chain molecule that has the same number of electrons. The smaller
surface area allows less opportunity for the molecule to induce a charge
on a nearby molecule. Therefore, for two substances with molecules that
have a similar number of electrons, the substance with molecules that
have a more spherical shape will have weaker dispersion forces and a
lower boiling point.

GETEEZEEY How dispersion forces develop between identical non-polar molecules. In A,
neither molecule interacts with the other. In B, one molecule becomes, instantaneously, a
dipole. At that moment, the dipolar molecule is able to induce a temporary charge separation
in the other molecule, resulting in a force of attraction between the two. All the molecules
within a sample undergo this same process, as shown in C.
Hydrogen Bonding
A dipole-dipole interaction that is very significant in many biological
molecules and some inorganic molecules, such as HO), is hydrogen
bonding. Hydrogen bonding is a particularly strong form of dipole-dipole
attraction that exists between a hydrogen atom in a polar-bonded
molecule that contains bonds such as H—O, H—N, or H—F, and an
unshared pair of electrons on another small, electronegative atom such
as O, N, or F. The small, electronegative atom can be on its own, but is
usually bonded in a molecule.
192 MHR-« Unit 2 Structure and Properties
When hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen, the strong
force of attraction exerted by any of these three very electronegative atoms
draws the electron density from the hydrogen atom in the polar-bonded
molecule, leaving the hydrogen atom with a partial positive charge. This
dipole is easily attracted to the partially negative lone pair on a nearby
electronegative atom: N, O, or F.
You can see the effect of hydrogen bonding clearly in the boiling
point data of the binary hydrides of Groups 14 to 17 (IVA to VIIA), shown
in Figure 4.16. In Group 14, the trend in boiling point is as expected.
The increase in boiling point from methane, CHa, to tin(IV) hydride,
SnHy,, is due to an increase in the number of electrons. Therefore, there
are larger dispersion forces, since more electrons are able to temporarily
shift from one part of the molecule to another. In SnHu, this results in
greater intermolecular forces of attraction. There is no hydrogen bonding
in these substances, because there are no lone pairs on the molecules.
However, the hydrides of Groups 15, 16, and 17 (VA to VIIA) only
show the expected trend based on dispersion forces for the larger mass
hydrides. The smallest mass hydrides, NH3, H2O, and HF, have relatively
high boiling points, indicating strong intermolecular forces caused by
hydrogen bonding.
Why is there no hydrogen bonding in H2S and H2Se, which have
unshared electron pairs on their central atoms? Neither S nor Se is small
enough or electronegative enough to support hydrogen bonding. Thus,
H,0 (with its small and very electronegative O atom) has a much higher
boiling point than H,S and H,Se, as you can see in Figure 4.16.

Chapter 4 Structures and Properties of Substances * MHR_ 193
Hydrogen Bonding and Properties of Water
Hydrogen bonding also explains water’s unusual property of being less
dense in the solid state than in the liquid state. As you know from kinetic
molecular theory, lower temperatures cause liquid molecules to move
slower than in their gaseous states. When liquids solidify, the kinetic
energy of the particles is no longer enough to prevent the intermolecular
forces of attraction from causing particles to stick together. For most
substances, their solid states are denser than their liquid states. When
water freezes, however, the water molecules pack in such a way that the
solid state is Jess dense than the liquid state. Water molecules align in a
specific pattern so that hydrogen atoms of one molecule are oriented
toward the oxygen atom of another molecule. You can see this clearly in
Figure 4.18. If water molecules behaved as most molecules do, then lake
water would freeze from the bottom up, rather than from the top down.
The consequences for aquatic life, and on organisms (like us) that depend
on aquatic ecosystems, would be profound. A lake that freezes from the
bottom up would solidify completely, killing most of the life it contains.
Because ice floats on water, it insulates the water beneath it, preventing
it from freezing.
Hydrogen bonding also explains the solubility in water of polar
covalent compounds. As you learned in Unit 1, the O—H functional
group in alcohols is polar. Because of this polar group, alcohols can form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Consequently, methanol and
ethanol are soluble in water in all proportions, and every alcohol is more
soluble than its corresponding alkane with the same number of carbon
atoms. (Recall that alkanes do not have the O—H functional group.)
Ammonia, NHsz, is a very soluble gas because it hydrogen-bonds with
water. The smaller mass amines, such as methylamine, CH3;NHg, are also
soluble in water, for the same reason.
CONCEPT CHECK

different from a covalent bond

In its solid state, water has an open, hexagonal, crystalline structure. As a
result of these spaces, ice is less dense than liquid water.

Bonding in Solids
In Investigation 4-A, you classified solid substances on the basis of the
types of bonds that hold their molecules or ions together. This is not,
however, the only way to classify solids. Chemists also divide solids
into two categories based on the macroscopic properties that arise
from the arrangements of their component particles. Crystalline solids
have organized particle arrangements, so they have distinct shapes.
Gemstones such as amethyst and garnet are examples of crystalline
solids. Amorphous solids have indistinct shapes, because their particle
arrangements lack order. Glass and rubber are common amorphous solids.
In the next few pages, you will learn about the structure and properties
of crystalline and amorphous solids.
Bonding and Properties of Crystalline Solids
Chemists further classify crystalline solids into five types, based on
their composition. These types are atomic, molecular, network, ionic,
and metallic. Since you have already learned about metallic solids, the
material that follows concentrates on the other four crystalline solids.
You will find a summary of their properties in Table 4.5, following these
descriptions.
196 MHR- Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Atomic Solids
Atomic solids are made up of individual atoms that are held together
solely by dispersion forces. The number of naturally occurring atomic
solids is quite small. In fact, the noble gases in their solid state are the
only examples. Since the only forces holding atomic solids together are
dispersion forces, these solids have very low melting and boiling points.
Molecular Solids
Molecular solids are, as their name implies, made up of molecules. Like
atomic solids, the molecules that make up molecular solids, such as
frozen methane, are held together mainly by dispersion forces.
Consequently, they tend to have low melting and boiling points. In polar
molecular solids, however, stronger dipole-dipole forces, and sometimes
hydrogen bonding, give these compounds higher melting points and
boiling points than non-polar molecular solids. For example, the melting
point of non-polar propane, C3Hs, is -190°C. A molecule of polar formic
acid, HCOOH, which has a similar number of electrons and the same
molar mass as propane, melts at 8.4°C. The large difference in boiling
point is due to the hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole forces in formic
acid. You will often see molecular solids classified as covalent solids.
However, it is clearer to classify them as molecular solids, because
network solids, which you will see below, also contain covalent bonds.
Network Solids
Unlike the intramolecular covalent bonds that hold atoms together in
discrete molecules, it is possible for atoms to bond covalently into
continuous two- or three-dimensional arrays, called network solids.
A wide range of properties can be found among network solids.
Carbon-Based Network Solids

and chemical properties.

conduct electricity. The planes of atoms within the diamond reflect light,
which gives diamond its brilliance and sparkle. The regular arrangement
of the carbon atoms in a crystalline structure, coupled with the strength of
the covalent C—C bonds, gives diamond its extreme hardness, and makes
it inert to corrosive chemicals.
Fullerenes make up a group of spherical allotropes of carbon.
Figure 4.19C shows Cgo, which is one type of fullerene discovered in
1985. It was given the name buckminsterfullerene because it resembles
the geodesic-domed structure designed by architect R. Buckminster Fuller.
Also known as “buckyballs,” Cgo is just one of several fullerenes that have
been discovered. Others have been shown to have the formula C79, Cya,
and Cgz. Because of their spherical shape, researchers have speculated
that fullerenes might make good lubricants.
Recently, microscopic-level research has developed very small carbon
networks called nanotubes. As you can see in Figure 4.19D, nanotubes
are like a fullerene network that has been stretched into a cylinder shape.
Nanotubes of Capg9 and higher may have applications in the manufacture
of high-strength fibres. In the year 2000, researchers built a nanotube with
a diameter of 4 x 10° m. Up to that time, this nanotube was the smallest
structure assembled.
Other Network Solids
Many network solids are compounds, not elements.
Examples include silica, SiO,, and various metal silicates.
If you were asked to draw a Lewis structure representing
SiOz, you might draw a molecule that looks like CO,.
However, unlike the bonding that occurs in COz, the silicon
atom in silica does not form a double bond with an oxygen
atom. The likely reason is that silicon’s 3p orbital is too
large to overlap effectively with a 2p orbital of the oxygen
atom. Instead, each silicon atom bonds to four oxygen
atoms to give a tetrahedral network with shared oxygen
atoms, as shown in Figure 4.20. The network is represented
by the formula (SiOz), indicating that SiO, is the simplest

Amorphous Solids
Solids that are composed of molecules that are not arranged in an orderly,
crystalline structure are called amorphous. This term comes from the
Greek word amorphos, meaning “without form.” Glass is a typical
example of this type of solid. Heating silica sand to its melting point of
approximately 1700°C, adding limestone (CaCO3) and soda ash (Na2CO3),
and then allowing the mixture to cool, was the first method of making
soda-lime glass, dating back 4000 years ago.
Today, soda-lime glass makes up almost 90% of all glass manufac-
tured and finds its applications in window glass and bottle production.
It typically contains SiOz, NagO, CaO, MgO, and Al,03. Soda-lime glass
is referred to as an ionic glass, with an approximate composition given by
the formula Na2O - CaO -(SiO2),. Figure 4.23 shows that each silicon atom
is surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedron. These tetrahedra are
randomly arranged among a network of Na* and Ca”* ions that fill in the
spaces to balance the negative charge on the tetrahedron network.
Glass is an isotropic material, which means that its properties are the
same in all directions. This is a useful property, since it means that glass
expands uniformly as it is heated.

Metal alloys can be amorphous, too. LiquidmetalTM alloy is an
amorphous alloy of zirconium mixed with nickel, titanium, copper, and
beryllium. It is used in the heads of some brands of golf clubs. Traditional
metal club heads may have microscopic gaps where planes of metallic
crystals meet. These tiny gaps are a potential source of weakness. The
amorphous alloy is non-crystalline, so the metal structure does not have
potential breakage sites.
A Material Made to Order: Intermolecular and Intramolecular
Forces in Action
The gloves in the photograph at the start of this chapter are anything but
ordinary. The thin, lightweight fabric can withstand startling impacts and
piercing forces, including small projectiles such as bullets. In fact, this
same fabric is used to make bulletproof vests. The long strands of fibre
used to make such protective gear are interlaced to form a dense “net”
that is capable of absorbing large amounts of energy. You have probably
heard the trade name for this astounding fibre: KEVLAR®. It was invented
by an American research chemist, Stephanie Kwolek, in 1965.
The secret to stopping a bullet with a fairly soft fabric is that it
behaves in much the same way as the netting on the goal frame used in
hockey. When a hockey puck strikes a net at 100 km/h, its kinetic energy
is transferred to the lengths of twine of the goal net. This twine is an
interlaced mesh that has strands which stretch horizontally and vertically
to disperse the energy of impact over a wide area.
The sample principle applies to KEVLAR®. It belongs to a class
of fibres called aramids, which are polymers containing aromatic
and amide groups. The polymer forms in the condensation reaction
between terephthalic acid and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine, as shown in
Figure 4.24A. The strength of the polymer comes from the intramolecular
forces in the aromatic group that limit bond rotation in the straight chains,
and the amide linkage that leads to intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between the straight chains, as shown in Figure 4.24B.

Chapter 4 Structures and Properties of Substances * MHR 205
In addition to stopping a bullet from penetrating the armour, a
bulletproof vest must also protect the body from the blunt force of impact.
A bulletproof vest cannot have as much “give” as a hockey net (that is, it
should not stretch back as much as hockey nets do upon impact).
Otherwise, its wearer would still be injured, even though the bullet might
not pierce the fabric. To accomplish this, the properties of KEVLAR® are
enhanced by twisting the strands to increase their density and thickness.
The strands are then woven very tightly. A resin coating is applied and
sandwiched between two layers of plastic film. Each layer acts as a net
and slows down the bullet a little at a time until it has been stopped.
Deriving Theory from Application: Superconductors
When she first synthesized KEVLAR®, Stephanie Kwolek did not know
that it would eventually be used in bulletproof vests or protective gloves.
She did, however, understand the theories behind the properties that
make it suitable for such applications—the theories of intermolecular
and intramolecular forces. This is not always the case. Often scientists
discover a material that has useful or interesting properties, but are unable
to explain them.
For example, in 1911, Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes
cooled some mercury to the boiling point of liquid helium: 4 K. He
found that at this low temperature, the mercury developed an astonishing
property. The super-cooled mercury had zero resistance when an electric
current passed through it. In other words, none of the energy of the
electrical current was given off as wasted heat. The mercury had become
a superconductor—a material with no resistance to electric current.
Most conducting materials, even good conductors such as copper, give
off wasted heat as electric current passes though them. In other words,
they have resistance. By contrast, superconductors are “perfect” electrical
conductors.
Scientists are interested in superconductors because they have a num-
ber of properties that arise from their lack of resistance. For example, once
a current is induced in a circuit made with a superconducting material,
the current continues to flow through the circuit indefinitely, without ever
diminishing. Also, superconductors have the ability to completely repel
magnetic field lines. This means that a magnet placed over a supercon-
ductor hovers in mid-air, as shown in Figure 4.25.
~~ a
A magnet hovers above a superconductor, cooled by liquid nitrogen.
206 MHR-* Unit 2 Structure and Properties
Since Onnes’s discovery, chemists have discovered other metals that
superconduct at extremely low temperatures. A niobum metal alloy was
found to exhibit superconductivity at 23 K, for example. But scientists
wanted to find materials that exhibit superconductivity at much higher
temperatures, because refrigerants like liquid helium are very expensive.
In 1986, materials containing copper oxide ions were discovered to
be superconductors at 30 K. This was an astounding discovery, because
these materials are insulators at room temperature and higher. Researchers
began experimenting with this new class of superconductors, tweaking
their composition, and soon developed a material (T1,Baz,CazCu3O19) that
superconducts at 125 K. This is close to the boiling point of nitrogen, a
cheaper refrigerant than liquid helium.
It would be ideal, of course, to eliminate the need for a refrigerant
altogether. Finding a material that exhibits superconductivity at room
temperature is one of the driving forces of superconductivity research,
and the search continues. As of 2001, the highest known temperature
for a superconductor is 138 K. Researchers continue to search for new
classes of materials that superconduct. In fact, in 2001, researchers found
evidence to suggest that carbon nanotubes may superconduct, even at
temperatures surpassing the boiling point of water.
Current and Future Applications
The properties of superconducting materials suggest a wealth of
applications. Despite the need to maintain low temperatures, they have
already found uses in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a medical diag-
nostic tool. They have also been used to create powerful electromagnets,
used in magnetically levitated (MAGLEV) trains. Superconductors in
the future could be used to make 100% efficient electrical wires,
allowing power plants to be built far from cities. A room-temperature
superconductor could also mean ultra-fast, low-power electronics.
Many of the ideas necessary to help describe and explain
superconductivity involve topics you will encounter in future chemistry
courses. Even armed with these ideas, however, researchers do not yet
have a complete, accepted theory to explain this intriguing property.
Nevertheless, the list of superconducting materials continues to expand,
and engineers continue to find practical applications for them.
Section Summary
Describing and explaining the chemical and physical changes in the
world around you requires an understanding of matter at the atomic level.
You have seen, for example, that the concepts of intramolecular and
intermolecular forces are both needed to articulate the bonding, structure,
and properties of substances as familiar as water and as exotic as
KEVLAR®. Each year, chemical engineers invent thousands of new
materials and substances. Each has its own characteristic structure and
properties. Each demonstrates the amazing diversity of matter that arises
from atoms, molecules and ions, and the forces among and between them.
In the next Unit, you will continue to examine chemical bonds, but
with a different emphasis. You will learn about the energy changes that
are associated with breaking and forming bonds. In other words, you will
examine the energy changes of chemical reactions.

Heat and Temperature
Heat, Q, refers to the transfer of kinetic energy. Heat is expressed in the
same units as energy—joules (J). Heat is transferred spontaneously from a
warmer object to a cooler object. When you close the door of your home on
a cold day to “prevent the cold from getting in,” you are actually preventing
the heat from escaping. You are preventing the kinetic energy in your warm
home from transferring to colder objects, including the cold air, outside.
Temperature, T, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
that make up a substance or system. You can think of temperature as a way
of quantifying how hot or cold a substance is, relative to another substance.
K >
| Figure 5.2 | Celsius degrees and Kelvin degrees are the same size. The Kelvin scale begins
at absolute zero. This is the temperature at which the particles in a substance have no kinetic
energy. Therefore, Kelvin temperatures are never negative. By contrast, 0°C is set at the
melting point of water. Celsius temperatures can be positive or negative.
Temperature is measured in either Celsius degrees (°C) or kelvins (K).
The Celsius scale is a relative scale. It was designed so that water’s
boiling point is at 100°C and water’s melting point is at 0°C. The Kelvin
scale, on the other hand, is an absolute scale. It was designed so that 0 K
is the temperature at which a substance possesses no kinetic energy. The
relationship between the Kelvin and Celsius scales is shown in Figure 5.2,
and by the following equation.
Temperature in Kelvin degrees = Temperature in Celsius degrees + 273.15
Enthalpy and Enthalpy Change
Chemists define the total internal energy of a substance at a constant
pressure as its enthalpy, H. Chemists do not work with the absolute
enthalpy of the reactants and products in a physical or chemical process.
Instead, they study the enthalpy change, AH, that accompanies a process.
That is, they study the relative enthalpy of the reactants and products in a
system. This is like saying that the distance between your home and your
school is 2 km. You do not usually talk about the absolute position of
your home and school in terms of their latitude, longitude, and elevation.
You talk about their relative position, in relation to each other.
The enthalpy change of a process is equivalent to its heat change at
constant pressure.
222 MHR- Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
Enthalpy Changes in Chemical Reactions
In chemical reactions, enthalpy changes result from chemical bonds being
broken and formed. Chemical bonds are sources of stored energy. Breaking
a bond is a process that requires energy. Creating a bond is a process that
releases energy. For example, consider the combustion reaction that takes
place when nitrogen reacts with oxygen.
Now) + O2(g) > 2NO¢)
In this reaction, one mole of nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds and one mole
of oxygen-oxygen double bonds are broken. Two moles of nitrogen-oxygen
bonds are formed. This reaction absorbs energy. In other words, more
energy is released to form two nitrogen-oxygen bonds than is used to break
one nitrogen-nitrogen bond and one oxygen-oxygen bond. When a reaction
results in a net absorption of energy, it is called an endothermic reaction.
On the other hand, when a reaction results in a net release of energy,
it is called an exothermic reaction. In an exothermic reaction, more energy
is released to form bonds than is used to break bonds. Therefore, energy is
released. Figure 5.3 shows the relationship between bond breaking, bond
formation, and endothermic and exothermic reactions.

The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is known as the enthalpy
of reaction, AH,,,. The enthalpy of reaction is dependent on conditions
such as temperature and pressure. Therefore, chemists often talk about the

Representing Exothermic Reactions
There are three different ways to represent the enthalpy change of an
exothermic reaction. The simplest way is to use a thermochemical
equation: a balanced chemical equation that indicates the amount of heat
that is absorbed or released by the reaction it represents. For example,
consider the exothermic reaction of one mole of hydrogen gas with half
a mole of oxygen gas to produce liquid water. For each mole of hydrogen
gas that reacts, 285.8 kJ of heat is produced. Notice that the heat term is
included with the products because heat is produced.

You can also indicate the enthalpy of reaction as a separate expression

negative.

A third way to represent the enthalpy of reaction is to use an enthalpy
diagram. Examine Figure 5.4 to see how this is done.
Representing Endothermic Reactions
The endothermic decomposition of solid magnesium carbonate produces
solid magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. For each mole of magne-
sium carbonate that decomposes, 117.3 kJ of energy is absorbed. As for an
exothermic reaction, there are three different ways to represent the
enthalpy change of an endothermic reaction.
You can include the enthalpy of reaction as a heat term in the
chemical equation. Because heat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction,
the heat term is included on the reactant side of the equation.
117.3 kJ + MgCOs(s) > MgOj) + CO2¢g)
You can also indicate the enthalpy of reaction as a separate expression
beside the chemical reaction. For endothermic reactions, the enthalpy of
reaction is always positive.
MgCOas) > MgO,s) + CO2¢z) AH’xn = 117.3 kJ
Finally, you can use a diagram to show the enthalpy of reaction.
Figure 5.5 shows how the decomposition of solid magnesium carbonate
can be represented graphically.
Stoichiometry and Thermochemical Equations
The thermochemical equation for the decomposition of magnesium
carbonate, shown above, indicates that 117.3 kJ of energy is absorbed
when one mole, or 84.32 g, of magnesium carbonate decomposes. The
decomposition of two moles of magnesium carbonate absorbs twice as

absorbed from the surroundings.
That is, if the amount of products formed doubles, the enthalpy change
also doubles. Figure 5.6 shows the relationship between the stoichiometry
of a reaction and its enthalpy change. Because of this relationship, an
exothermic reaction that is relatively safe on a small scale may be
extremely dangerous on a large scale. One of the jobs of a chemical
engineer is to design systems that allow exothermic reactions to be carried
out safely on a large scale. For example, the blast furnaces used in steel
making must withstand temperatures of up to 2000°C, produced by the
exothermic combustion reaction of coal with oxygen.

Heat Changes and Physical Changes
Enthalpy changes are associated with physical changes as well as with
chemical reactions. You have observed examples of these enthalpy
changes in your daily life. Suppose that you want to prepare some pasta.
You put an uncovered pot of water on a stove element. The heat from the
element causes the water to become steadily hotter, until it reaches 100°C
(the boiling point of water at 100 kPa). At this temperature, heat is still
being added to the water. The average kinetic energy of the liquid water
molecules does not increase, however. Instead, the energy is used to break
the intermolecular bonds between the water molecules as they change
from liquid to vapour. The temperature of the liquid water remains at
226 MHR « Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
100°C until all the water has been vaporized. If you add heat to the
vapour, the temperature of the vapour will increase steadily.
When you heat ice that is colder than 0°C, a similar process occurs.
The temperature of the ice increases until it is 0°C (the melting point of
water). If you continue to add heat, the ice remains at 0°C but begins to
melt, as the bonds between the water molecules in the solid state begin
to break.
Figure 5.7 shows the relationship between temperature and heat for
a solid substance that melts and then vaporizes as heat is added to it.

Vaporization and condensation are opposite processes. Thus, the
enthalpy changes for these processes have the same value but opposite
signs. For example, 6.02 kJ is needed to vaporize one mole of water.
Therefore, 6.02 kJ of energy is released when one mole of water freezes.

Hot Packs and Cold Packs:
Using the Energy of Physical Changes
You just learned about the enthalpy changes that are associated with
phase changes. Another type of physical change that involves a heat
transfer is dissolution. When a solute dissolves in a solvent, the enthalpy
change that occurs is called the enthalpy of solution, AHgoin. Dissolution
can be either endothermic or exothermic.
Manufacturers take advantage of endothermic dissolution to
produce cold packs that athletes can use to treat injuries. One type of cold
pack contains water and a salt, such as ammonium nitrate, in separate
compartments. When you crush the pack, the membrane that divides the
compartments breaks, and the salt dissolves. This dissolution process is
endothermic. It absorbs heat for a short period of time, so the cold pack
feels cold. Figure 5.8 shows how a cold pack works.
soluble salt
membrane of
water pack
A typical cold pack has two separate chambers. One chamber
contains a salt. The other chamber contains water. Crushing
the pack allows the salt to dissolve in the water—an
endothermic process.
This person's shoulder was injured. Using a cold pack helps to reduce the
inflammation of the joint.
Some types of hot packs are constructed in much the same way as the cold
packs described above. They have two compartments. One compartment
contains a salt, such as calcium chloride. The other compartment contains
water. In hot packs, however, the dissolution process is exothermic. It
releases heat to the surroundings.

we have known that mass and energy are interconvertible. In Einstein’s
equation, FE is energy in kg+ m7*/s? (J), mis the mass in kg, and c? is the
square of the speed of light.
c* = (3.0 x 10° m/s)?
= 9.0 x 10'° m’/s?
As you can see, c* is an enormous number. Therefore, even a very tiny
amount of matter is equivalent to a significant amount of energy.
For example, compare the mass of 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms with the
mass of the individual nucleons in 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms. The mass of
6 mol of hydrogen-1 atoms (one proton and one electron each) and 6 mol
of neutrons is 12.098 940 g. The mass of 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms is
exactly 12 g. Note that the mass of the electrons does not change in a
nuclear reaction.
12.098 940 g/mol
— 12.000 000 g/mol
0.098 940 g/mol
The difference in mass is significant. It would show up on any reasonably
precise balance. Thus, the mass of the nucleus of carbon-12 is significant-
ly less than the mass of its component nucleons. The difference in mass
between a nucleus and its nucleons is known as the mass defect. What
causes this mass defect? It is caused by the nuclear binding energy: the
energy associated with the strong force that holds a nucleus together.
Nucleus + Nuclear binding energy — Nucleons
You can use Einstein’s equation to calculate the nuclear binding
energy for carbon-12.
AE = Amc?
= (9.89 x 10° kg/mol)(9.0 x 101° m?/s?)
= 8.9 x 10” J/mol
= 8.9 x 10° kJ/mol
Clearly, the energy associated with the bonds that hold a nucleus together
is much greater than the energy associated with chemical bonds, which
are usually only a few hundred kJ/mol.
The higher the binding energy of a nucleus, the more stable the nucleus
is. Nuclei with mass numbers (A) that are close to 60 are the most stable.
Nuclear reactions, in which nuclei break apart or fuse, tend to form nuclei
that are more stable than the reactant nuclei. Figure 5.9 illustrates the
relative stability of various nuclei.

destructiveness of an atomic bomb.

234 MHR- Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
All samples of the same substance have the same specific heat
capacity. In contrast, heat capacity, C, relates the heat of a sample, object,
or system to its change in temperature. Heat capacity is usually expressed
in units of kJ/°C.
Consider a bathtub full of water and a teacup full of water at room
temperature. All the water has the same specific heat capacity, but the
two samples have different heat capacities. It would take a great deal more
heat to raise the temperature of the water in the bathtub by 10°C than it
would take to raise the temperature of the water in the teacup by 10°C.
Therefore, the water in the bathtub has a higher heat capacity.
Specific Heat Capacity and Heat Transfer
You can use the following equation to calculate the heat change of a sub-
stance, based on the mass of the substance. You can also use this equation
to calculate the specific heat capacity of the substance and the change in
its temperature.
Q=meceAT
where Q = heat (J)
m = mass (g)
c = specific heat capacity (J/g « °C)
AT = T;(final temperature) — T; (initial temperature)(°C or K)
Water is often used in controlled surroundings to measure the heat of a
reaction. For example, you can use the equation above to determine the
amount of energy that is needed to heat 1.00 x 10? g of water from 20.0°C
to 45.0°C.
Q=meceAT
The mass of the water is 1.00 x 10? g. The specific heat capacity of water
is 4.184 J/g-°C. The temperature of the water increases by 25.0°C.
“.Q = (1.00 x 107,2)(4.184 J/g °€)(25.0°€)
= 1.05 x 10*J
To raise the temperature of 1.00 x 10? g of water by 25°C, 1.05 x 10* J of
heat is needed.
Try the following problems to practise working with specific heat
capacity and temperature change.

Measuring Heat Transfer in a Laboratory
From previous science courses, you will probably remember that a
calorimeter is used to measure enthalpy changes for chemical and
physical reactions. A calorimeter works by insulating a system from its
surroundings. By measuring the temperature change of the system, you
can determine the amount of heat that is released or absorbed by the
reaction. For example, the heat that is released by an exothermic
reaction raises the temperature of the system.

disagree with this practice.
As with any calorimeter, each part of the coffee-cup calori-meter has
an associated heat capacity. Because these heat capacities are very small,
however, and because a coffee-cup calorimeter is not as accurate as other
calorimeters, the heat capacity of a coffee-cup calorimeter is usually
assumed to be negligible. It is assumed to have a value of 0 J/°C.
Using a Calorimeter to Determine the Enthalpy of a Reaction
A coffee-cup calorimeter is well-suited to determining the enthalpy
changes of reactions in dilute aqueous solutions. The water in the
calorimeter absorbs (or provides) the energy that is released (or absorbed)
by a chemical reaction. When carrying out an experiment in a dilute
solution, the solution itself absorbs or releases the energy. You can
calculate the amount of energy that is absorbed or released by the
solution using the equation mentioned earlier.
Q=meceAT
The mass, m, is the mass of the solution, because the solution absorbs the
heat. When a dilute aqueous solution is used in a calorimeter, you can
assume that the solution has the same density and specific heat capacity
as pure water. As you saw above, you can also assume that the heat
capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. In other words, you can assume
that all the heat that is released or absorbed by the reaction is absorbed
or released by the solution.
The following Sample Problem illustrates how calorimetry can be
used to determine AH of a chemical reaction.

is 21.4°C. After mixing the solutions in the coffee-cup calorimeter, the
highest temperature that is reached is 24.6°C. Determine the enthalpy
change of the reaction. Then write the thermochemical equation.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate AH of the given reaction.
What Is Given?
You know the volume of each solution. You also know the initial
temperature of each solution and the final temperature of the reaction
mixture.
Volume of CuSO, solution, Vcuso, = 50.0 mL
Volume of NaOH solution, VNaoy = 50.0 mL
Initial temperature, T; = 21.4°C
Final temperature, T; = 24.6°C
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1 Determine the total volume by adding the volumes of the two
solutions. Determine the total mass of the reaction mixture,
assuming a density of 1.00 g/mL (the density of water).
Step 2 Use the equation Q = m-ec-eAT to calculate the amount of
heat that is absorbed by the solution (in J). Assume that the
reaction mixture has the same specific heat capacity as water
(c = 4.184 J/g °C).
Step 3 Use the equation Qreaction = —Qsolution to determine the amount of
heat that is released by the reaction.
Step 4 Determine the number of moles of CuSO, and NaOH that reacted.
If necessary, determine the limiting reactant. Use the amount of
limiting reactant to get AH of the reaction (in kJ/mol).
Step 5 Use your AH to write the thermochemical equation for the
reaction.
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 The total volume of the reaction mixture is
50.0 mL + 50.0 mL = 100.0 mL
The mass of the reaction mixture, assuming a density of
1.00 g/mL, is
m= DV

Step 2 The amount of heat, Q, that is absorbed by the solution is
Qsolution = Msolution * Csolution * AT solution
= (100 g)(4.184 J/g’- °@)(24.6°E — 21.4°C)
=1.3x10°J
Step 3 Based on the value of Q in step 2, the heat change for the
reaction is —1.3 x 10° J.
Step 4 Calculate the number of moles of CuSQ, as follows.
n=ceV
= (0.300 mol/K)(50.0 x 10°24)
= 0.0150 mol
Calculate the number of moles of NaOH.
nmol NaOH = (0.600 mol/¥)(50.0 x 1074°)
= 0.300 mol
The reactants are present in stoichiometric amounts. (There is no
limiting reactant.)
AH of the reaction, in kJ/mol CuSQ,, is
_ -1.3 x 10°J
AH = 0.0150 mol CuSO,
= -8.9 x 10° J/mol CuSO,
= —89 kJ/mol CuSO,
The enthalpy change of the reaction is —-89 kJ/mol CuSQg.
Step5 The thermochemical equation is
CuSOataq) + 2NaOH aq) — Cu(OH)as) + NazSOataq) AH = -89 kJ
Check Your Solution
The solution has the correct number of significant digits. The units are
correct. You know that the reaction was exothermic, because the temper-
ature of the solution increased. The calculated AH is negative, which is
correct for an exothermic reaction.

\ y,
In Practice Problems 9, 11, and 12, you used experimental data to deter-
mine the enthalpy of reaction for neutralization reactions. Neutralization
reactions are particularly well suited to analysis involving the use of a
coffee-cup calorimeter for a number of reasons:
e When using dilute solutions of acids and bases, you can assume
their density is close to the density of water. Therefore, you can easily
measure the volume of the solutions and calculate their mass.
e Neutralization reactions between dilute strong acids and dilute strong
bases tend to cause temperature changes in the reaction mixture that are
large enough to be measurable using a standard thermometer, but small
enough for safety.
e Neutralization reactions take place very quickly. Therefore, the peak
temperature change also occurs very quickly. There is little time for
heat transfer between the insulated system and the surroundings to
take place.
In the following investigation, you will construct a coffee-cup calorimeter
and use it to determine the enthalpy of a neutralization reaction.

form carbon dioxide.) Notice that the sum of the enthalpy changes for the

Hess’s law allows you to determine the energy of a chemical reaction
without directly measuring it. In this section, you will examine two ways
in which you can use Hess’s law to calculate the enthalpy change of a
chemical reaction:
1. by combining chemical equations algebraically
2. by using the enthalpy of a special class of reactions called
formation reactions
Combining Chemical Equations Algebraically
According to Hess’s law, the pathway that is taken in a chemical reaction
has no effect on the enthalpy change of the reaction. How can you use
Hess’s law to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction? One way is to
add equations for reactions with known enthalpy changes, so that their
net result is the reaction you are interested in.
For example, you can combine thermochemical equations (1) and (2)
below to find the enthalpy change for the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide, equation (3).
(2) Hog) + LO > H.0,, AH’ = -286 kJ
(3) HyOo1 + HOw + Ox) AH" =?
Carefully examine equation (3), the target equation. Notice that
H2O: is on the left (reactant) side, while H2O and 502 are on the right
(product) side. Now examine equations (1) and (2). Notice which sides of
the equations HzO, and H,O are on. They are on the correct sides, based
on equation (3). Also notice that hydrogen does not appear in equation (3).
Therefore, it must cancel out when equations (1) and (2) are added. Since
there is one mole of Hag) on the product side of equation (1) and one mole
of Hag) on the reactant side of equation (2), these two terms cancel. Set up
equations (1) and (2) as shown on the next page. Add the products and
the reactants. Then cancel any substances that appear on opposite sides.

or
Equations (1) and (2) add to give equation (3). Therefore, you know that
the enthalpy change for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is the
sum of the enthalpy changes of equations (1) and (2).

In the previous example, you did not need to manipulate the two equa-
tions with known enthalpy changes. They added to the target equation as
they were written. In many cases, however, you will need to manipulate
the equations before adding them. There are two key ways in which you
can manipulate an equation:
1. Reverse an equation so that the products become reactants and the
reactants become products. When you reverse an equation, you need
to change the sign of AH’*(multiply by —1).
2. Multiply each coefficient in an equation by the same integer or
fraction. When you multiply an equation, you need to multiply AH”
by the same number.
Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to manipulate
equations so that they add to the target equation. Try the problems that
follow to practise finding the enthalpy change by adding equations.

Step 3 Ensure that you have obtained the target equation. Add AH” for

Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 Equation (1) has CO as a reactant and CO, as a product, as does
the target reaction. The stoichiometric coefficients do not match
the coefficients in the target equation, however. To achieve the
same coefficients, you must multiply equation (1) by 3.
Equation (2) has the required stoichiometric coefficients, but Fe
and Fe,Os3 are on the wrong sides of the equation. You need to
reverse equation (2) and change the sign of AH’.
Step 2 Multiply each equation as required, and add them.

Step 3 The desired equation is achieved. Therefore, you can calculate
the enthalpy change of the target reaction by adding the heats

Using Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation
You have learned how to add equations with known enthalpy changes
to obtain the enthalpy change for another equation. This method can be
time-consuming and difficult, however, because you need to find reactions
with known enthalpy changes that will add to give your target equation.
There is another way to use Hess’s law to find the enthalpy of an equation.
Formation Reactions
In Investigation 5-B, you used the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen to
form water. Reactions like this one are known as formation reactions. In a
formation reaction, a substance is formed from elements in their standard
states. The enthalpy change of a formation reaction is called the standard
molar enthalpy of formation, AH’. The standard molar enthalpy of forma-
tion is the quantity of energy that is absorbed or released when one mole of
a compound is formed directly from its elements in their standard states.
Some standard molar enthalpies of formation are listed in Table 5.3.
Notice that the standard enthalpies of formation of most compounds are
negative. Thus, most compounds are more stable than the elements they
are made from.

By definition, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard
state is zero. The standard state of an element is usually its most
stable form under standard conditions. Recall, from section 5.1, that
standard conditions are 25°C and 100 kPa (close to room temperature
and pressure). Therefore, the standard state of nitrogen is Nag). The
standard state of magnesium is Mgj).
Some elements exist in more than one form under standard condi-
tions. For example, carbon can exist as either graphite or diamond, as
shown in Figure 5.16. Graphite is defined as the standard state of carbon.
Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of graphite carbon is 0
kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation of diamond is 1.9 kJ/mol.
Another example is oxygen, Ozg). Oxygen also exists in the form of ozone,
250 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
Oz(g), under standard conditions. The diatomic molecule is defined as the
standard state of oxygen, however, because it is far more stable than
ozone. Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of oxygen gas, Oz),
is 0 kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation of ozone is 143 kJ/mol.
GETS Carbon can exist as

When writing a formation equation, always write the elements in their
standard states. For example, examine the equation for the formation of
water directly from its elements under standard conditions.

Calculating Enthalpy Changes
You can calculate the enthalpy change of a chemical reaction by adding
the heats of formation of the products and subtracting the heats of forma-
tion of the reactants. The following equation can be used to determine the
enthalpy change of a chemical reaction.
AH® = X(nAH"*; products) — X(nAH"*; reactants)
In this equation, n represents the molar coefficient of each compound in
the balanced chemical equation and 2 means “the sum of.”
As usual, you need to begin with a balanced chemical equation. If a
given reactant or product has a molar coefficient that is not 1, you need to
multiply its AH“; by the same molar coefficient. This makes sense because
the units of AH”; are kJ/mol. Consider, for example, the complete
combustion of methane, CHa).
CHa) + 202%) > COa(g) + 2H206)
Using the equation for the enthalpy change, and the standard enthalpies
of formation in Appendix E, you can calculate the enthalpy change of this
reaction.
AH’ = |(AH’; of CO2,~)) + 2(AH’; of H20@))] — [1(AH’; of CHa) + 2(AH’*; of O2(g))]
Substitute the standard enthalpies of formation from Appendix E to get
the following calculation.
AH® = [(-393.5 kJ/mol) + 2(—241.8 kJ/mol)] — [(-74.8 kJ/mol) + 2(0 kJ/mol)]
= -802.3 kJ/mol of CH,
How does this method of adding heats of formation relate to Hess’s law?
Consider the equations for the formation of each compound that is
involved in the reaction of methane with oxygen.
(1) Hyg) + +O) + H20@) AH"; = -241.8 kj

data. When you used the addition method, you performed the same
operations on the enthalpies of formation before adding them. Therefore,
using enthalpies of formation to determine the enthalpy of a reaction is
consistent with Hess’s law. Figure 5.17 shows the general process for
determining the enthalpy of a reaction from enthalpies of formation.

The overall enthalpy change of any reaction is the sum of the enthalpy change
of the decomposition of the reactants to their elements and the enthalpy change of the forma-
tion of the products from their elements.
It is important to realize that, in most reactions, the reactants do not
actually break down into their elements and then react to form products.
Since there is extensive data about enthalpies of formation, however,
it is useful to calculate the overall enthalpy change this way. Moreover,
according to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change is the same, regardless of
the pathway. (In Chapter 6, you will learn more about the mechanisms
by which compounds and elements react to form different elements and
compounds.) Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to use

Energy and Efficiency
When you think about energy efficiency, what comes to mind? You may
think about taking the stairs instead of the elevator, choosing to drive a
small car instead of a sport utility vehicle, or turning off lights when you
are not using them. What, however, does efficiency really mean? How do
you quantify it?
There are several ways to define efficiency. One general definition
says that energy efficiency is the ability to produce a desired effect with
minimum energy expenditure. For example, suppose that you want to
bake a potato. You can use a microwave oven or a conventional oven.
Both options achieve the same effect (baking the potato), but the first
option uses less energy. According to the general definition above, using
the microwave oven is more energy-efficient than using the conventional
oven. The general definition is useful, but it is not quantitative.
Another definition of efficiency suggests that it is the ratio of useful
energy produced to energy used in its production, expressed as a percent.
This definition quantitatively compares input and output of energy. When
you use it, however, you need to be clear about what you mean by “energy
used.” Figure 5.19 shows factors to consider when calculating efficiency
or analyzing efficiency data.

useful energy. Often an efficiency percent only takes into account the “energy used” part of the ratio.
“ideal” energy output of a system, based on the energy content of the fuel.
Efficiency and Natural Gas
When discussing the efficiency of a fuel such as natural gas, you need to
specify how that fuel is being used. Consider, for example, natural gas.
Natural gas is primarily methane. Therefore, you can estimate an ideal
value for energy production using the enthalpy of combustion of methane.
CHa(g) + 202) > COxg) + 2H,0%) AH’ = -802 kJ
In other words, 16 g of methane produces 802 kJ of heat (under constant
pressure conditions).
When natural gas is used directly in cooking devices, its efficiency can
be as high as 90%. Thus, for every 16 g of gas burned, you get about 720 kJ
(0.90 x 802 kJ) of usable energy as heat for cooking. This is a much higher
fuel efficiency than you can get with appliances that use electrical energy
produced in a power plant that runs on a fuel such as coal.
If natural gas is used to produce electricity in a power plant, however,
the efficiency is much lower—around 37%. Why? The heat from the
burning natural gas is used to boil water. The kinetic energy of the result-
ing steam is transformed to mechanical energy for turning a turbine.
The turbine generates the electrical energy. Each of these steps has an
associated efficiency that is less than 100%. Thus, at each step, the overall
efficiency of the fuel decreases.
Thinking About the Environment
Efficiency is not the only criterion for selecting an energy source. Since
the 1970s, society has become increasingly conscious of the impact of
energy technologies on the environment.
Suppose that you want to analyze the environmental impact of an
energy source. You can ask the following questions:
e Are any waste products or by-products of the energy production
process harmful to the environment? For example, any process in which
a hydrocarbon is burned produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a
known greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming. Any com-
bustion process provides the heat required to form oxides of nitrogen
from nitrogen gas. Nitrogen oxides contribute to acid precipitation.
e Is obtaining or harnessing the fuel harmful to the environment? For
example, oil wells and strip coal mines destroy habitat. Natural gas GETTY This gas pipeline
pipelines, shown in Figure 5.20, are visually unappealing. They also harms the ecosystem by splitting
split up habitat, which harms the ecosystem. up habitat.
Chapter 5 Energy and Change» MHR 257
e Will using the energy source permanently remove the fuel from the
environment? A non-renewable energy source (such as coal, oil, or
natural gas) is effectively gone once we have used it up. Non-renewable
energy sources take millions of years to form. We use them up at a
much faster rate than they can be replenished. An energy source that
is clearly renewable is solar energy. The Sun will continue to radiate
energy toward Earth over its lifetime—many millions of years. A some-
what renewable energy source is wood. Trees can be grown to replace
those cut down. It takes trees a long time to grow, however, and habitat
is often destroyed in the meantime.
Comparing Energy Sources
Both efficiency and environmental impact are important factors to con-
sider when comparing energy sources. In the following ThoughtLab, you
will research and compare alternative and conventional energy sources.

Emerging Energy Sources
In the ThoughtLab on page 258, you probably noticed that all energy
sources have drawbacks as well as benefits. Scientists and engineers are
striving to find and develop new and better energy sources. One energy
source that engineers are trying to harness is nuclear fusion. As you
learned in section 5.1, nuclear fusion provides a great deal of energy from
readily available fuel (isotopes of hydrogen). In addition, nuclear fusion
produces a more benign waste product than nuclear fission (helium).
Unfortunately, fusion is not yet practical and controllable on a large scale
because of the enormous temperatures involved.
Chemists are also striving to find new sources for existing fuels that
work well. The Chemistry Bulletin on the facing page discusses a new
potential source of methane.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned about efficiency. You learned how it can
be defined in different ways for different purposes. You used your
understanding of processes that produce energy to investigate the
efficiency and environmental impact of different energy sources.
In Chapter 5, you learned about the energy that is associated with
chemical reactions. You used a calorimeter to measure heat changes, and
you used these heat changes to write thermochemical equations. You
probably already realize that adding heat to reactants often speeds up a
reaction. In other words, raising the temperature of a system consisting of
a chemical reaction often increases the speed of the reaction. A familiar
example is cooking. You increase the temperature of a heating element
to speed up the reactions that are taking place in the food as it cooks.
How does increasing temperature speed up a reaction? Is the enthalpy
of a reaction related to its speed? Chapter 6 addresses these questions.
Section Review
@ @ Your friend tells you about an energy source that is supposed to be
46% efficient. What questions do you need to ask your friend in order
to clarify this claim?
© @ Efficiency and environmental concerns are not always separate. In
fact, they are often closely linked. Give three examples of energy
sources in which changes in efficiency affect environmental impact, or
vice versa.
© @ Design an experiment to determine the efficiency of a laboratory
burner. You will first need to decide how to define the efficiency, and
you will also need to find out what fuel your burner uses. Include a
complete procedure and safety precautions.
0 Some high-efficiency gas furnaces can heat with an efficiency of
up to 97%. These gas furnaces work by allowing the water vapour pro-
duced during combustion to condense. Condensation is an exothermic
reaction that releases further energy for heating. Use the information in
this section to demonstrate the increased heat output, using Hess’s law.
The enthalpy of condensation of water is 44 kJ/mol.

© @ Hydrogen is a very appealing fuel, in part because burning it
produces only non-polluting water. One of the challenges that
researchers face in making hydrogen fuel a reality is how to produce
hydrogen economically. Researchers are investigating methods of
producing hydrogen indirectly. The following series of equations

Reaction rates are always positive, by convention. A rate that is expressed
as the change in concentration of a product is the rate at which the
concentration of the product is increasing. The rate that is expressed
in terms of the change in concentration of a reactant is the rate at which
the concentration of the reactant is decreasing.
Average and Instantaneous Rates of Reactions
If reactions always proceeded at a constant rate, it would be straight-
forward to find reaction rates. You would just need the initial and final
concentrations and the time interval. Reaction rates, however, are not
usually constant. They change with time. How does this affect the way
that chemists determine reaction rates?
Consider the following reaction.
Aig) > Cg) + De
Now examine the graph in Figure 6.2. The blue line on the graph shows
the concentration of product C as the reaction progresses, based on the
data in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1 Concentration of C During a Reaction at Constant Temperature
Time (s) | [C] (mol/L)
0.0 0.00
5.0 3.12 x 1073
10.0 4.41 x 10°
15.0 5.40 x 10°73
20.0 6.24 x 10°
The average rate of a reaction is the average change in the concentration
of a reactant or product per unit time over a given time interval. For
example, using the data in Table 6.1, you can determine the average rate
of the reaction from t=0.0 stot=5.0s.
AlCl
Average rate =
At
(3.12 x 10 mol/L) — 0.00 mol/L
5.0s—0.0s
= 6.2 x 10* mol/(L-s)
You can see this calculation in Figure 6.2. On a concentration-time graph,
the average rate of a reaction is represented by the slope of a line that is
drawn between two points on the curve. This line is called a secant.
The average rate of a reaction gives an overall idea of how quickly the
reaction is progressing. It does not, however, tell you how fast the reaction
is progressing at a specific time. For example, suppose that someone
asked you how fast the reaction in Figure 6.2 was progressing over 20.0 s.
You would probably calculate the average rate from t = 0.0 s to t = 20.0 s.
You would come up with the answer 3.12 x 10° mol/(Les). (Try this
calculation yourself.) What would you do, however, if you were asked
how fast the reaction was progressing at exactly t= 10.0 s?
The instantaneous rate of a reaction is the rate of the reaction at a
particular time. To find the instantaneous rate of a reaction using a
concentration-time graph, draw a tangent line to the curve and find the
slope of the tangent. A tangent line is like a secant line, but it touches the
curve at only one point. It does not intersect the curve.

Reaction Rates in Terms of Products and Reactants
In the ThoughtLab, you analyzed the rate of the following reaction in
terms of the production of oxygen.
2N205¢@) > 4NO2@) + O2(g)
There are two other ways to represent the rate of this reaction:
e in terms of the rate of the disappearance of dinitrogen pentoxide
e in terms of the production of nitrogen dioxide
For every 1 mol of O2 that is produced, 4 mol of NOz are also produced.
This means that the rate of production of NO, is four times greater than
the rate of production of O2. Therefore, the rate of production of O2 is one
quarter the rate of production of NO,. You can express the relationship
between O, production and NO, production as follows.

When 1 mol of O2 is produced, 2 mol of N20; are consumed. Therefore,
the rate of production of Oz is half the rate of disappearance of N2O;. You
can represent this relationship as follows:

NO, is produced at a rate of 5.0 x 10° mol/(L+s). What is the
corresponding rate of disappearance of N2O; and rate of formation of O2?
What Is Required?
Since N2O; is a reactant, you need to calculate its rate of disappearance.
O2 is a product, so you need to find its rate of formation.
What Is Given?
You know the rate of formation of NO» and the balanced chemical
equation.
Plan Your Strategy
First check that the chemical equation is balanced. Then use the molar
coefficients in the balanced equation to determine the relative rates of
disappearance and formation.
Since 4 mol of NO are produced for every 2 mol of N2O; that
decompose, the rate of disappearance of N2Os is 2 or > the rate of
formation of NOz. Similarly, 1 mol of Oz is formed for every 4 mol
of NO,. Therefore, the rate of production of Oz is z the rate of NO»

Methods for Measuring Reaction Rates
How do chemists collect the data they need to determine a reaction rate?
To determine empirically the rate of a chemical reaction, chemists must
monitor the concentration or amount of at least one reactant or product.
There are a variety of techniques available. The choice of technique
depends on the reaction under study and the equipment available.
Monitoring Mass, pH, and Conductivity
Consider the reaction of magnesium with hydrochloric acid.
Mgjs) + 2HCliag) > MgClo(aq) + Hag)
Hydrogen gas is released in the reaction. You can track the decrease in
mass, due to the escaping hydrogen, by carrying out the reaction in an
open vessel on an electric balance. The decrease in mass can be plotted
against time. Some electronic balances can be connected to a computer,
with the appropriate software, to record mass and time data automatically
as the reaction proceeds.
Another technique for monitoring the reaction above involves pH.

A third technique involves electrical conductivity. Dissolved ions in SS ~PROBEWARE
aqueous solution conduct electricity. The electrical conductivity of the
solution is proportional to the concentration of ions. Therefore, reactions If you have access to
that occur in aqueous solution, and involve a change in the quantity of probeware, do Probeware
dissolved ions, undergo a change in electrical conductivity. In the reaction Investigation 6-A, or a similar
above, hydrochloric acid is a mix of equal molar amounts of two ions: investigation from a probeware
hydronium, H;0*, and chloride, Cl". The MgCl, that is produced exists as rompany:
three separate ions in solution: one Mg** ion and two CI ions. Since there
is an increase in the concentration of ions as the reaction proceeds, the
conductivity of the solution also increases with time.
Monitoring Pressure
When a reaction involves gases, the pressure of the system often changes
as the reaction progresses. Chemists can monitor this pressure change. For
example, consider the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide, shown in
the following chemical reaction.
2N205(g) > 4NO2ig) + Ong)
When 2 mol of N20; gas decompose, they form 5 mol of gaseous products.
Therefore, the pressure of the system increases as the reaction proceeds,
provided that the reaction is carried out in a closed container. Chemists
use a pressure sensor to monitor pressure changes.
Monitoring Colour
Colour change can also be used to monitor the progress of a reaction.
The absorption of light by a chemical compound is directly related to the
concentration of the compound. For example, suppose you add several
drops of blue food colouring to a litre of water. If you add a few millilitres
of bleach to the solution, the intensity of the colour of the food dye
diminishes as it reacts. You can then monitor the colour change. (Do not
try this experiment without your teacher’s supervision.)
For accurate measurements of the colour intensity of a solution,
chemists use a device called a spectrophotometer. (See Figure 6.4.)
This photograph
shows a simple spectrophotometer,
which measures the amount of
visible light that is absorbed by
a coloured solution. More sophisti-
cated devices can measure the
absorption of ultraviolet and
infrared radiation.
Monitoring Volume
When a reaction generates gas, chemists can monitor the volume of gas
produced. In Investigation 6-A, you will determine average reaction rates
by recording the time taken to produce a fixed volume of gas. You will
perform several trials of the same reaction to investigate the effects that
temperature, concentration of reactants, and surface area of reactants
have on the reaction rate. You will also perform one trial using a
different reactant.

Factors That Affect Reaction Rate
Chemists have made the following observations about factors that affect
reaction rate. You may already be familiar with some of these observa-
tions, from your previous studies of chemical reactions and from
Investigation 6-A.
Summary of Some Factors That Affect Reaction Rate
1. The rate of a reaction can be increased by increasing the
temperature.
2. Increasing the concentrations of the reactants usually increases
the rate of the reaction.
3. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction.
The catalyst is regenerated at the end of the reaction and can be
re-used. You will learn more about catalysts in section 6.4.
4. Increasing the available surface area of a reactant increases the rate
of a reaction.
5. The rate of a chemical reaction depends on what the reactants are.
Chemists and engineers use these and other factors to manipulate the
rate of a particular reaction to suit their needs. For example, consider the
synthesis of ammonia, NHs, from nitrogen and hydrogen.
Now) + 3H) > 2NH3(g)
This reaction must be carried out with high concentrations of reactants, at
a temperature of 400°C to 500°C, in the presence of a catalyst. Otherwise,
the rate of production of ammonia is too slow to be economically feasible.

Rate « [A]"[B]”
This relationship can be expressed in a general equation called the
rate law equation. The rate law equation is shown in Figure 6.5. For any
reaction, the rate law equation expresses the relationship between the
concentrations of the reactants and the rate of the reaction. The letter k
represents a proportionality constant called the rate constant. There is
a different rate constant for each reaction at any given temperature.
The exponents m and n must be determined by experiment. They
do not necessarily correspond to the stoichiometric coefficients of their
reactants. They are usually 1 or 2, but values of 0, 3, and even fractions
can occur.

278 MHR-* Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
The values of the exponents in the rate law equation establish the
order of the reaction. If a given reactant is found to have an exponent of 1,
the reaction is said to be first order in this reactant. Similarly, if the
exponent of a reactant is 2, the reaction is second order in this reactant.
The sum of the exponents (m + n) is known as the overall reaction order.
For example, the rate law equation below represents a reaction that is first
order in A, second order in B, and third order (1 + 2) overall.
Rate = k[A]"|[B]?
Chemists carry out experiments to determine the rate law equation for a
given reaction at a given temperature. Later in the section, you will work
with data and do this yourself. First, however, it is necessary to examine
further the rate constant and reaction order.
The Rate Constant
The magnitude of the rate constant, k, indicates the speed of a reaction.
A small rate constant indicates a slow reaction. A large rate constant
indicates a fast reaction. For example, a first-order reaction with a rate
constant of 10? s will be essentially complete in less than 0.10 s. By
contrast, a first-order reaction with a rate constant of 10° s! will take
about 2 h.
As a reaction proceeds, the reaction rate decreases because the
concentrations of the reactants decrease. The value of the rate constant,
however, remains the same throughout the reaction. In other words, for a
given reaction under constant conditions, the value of k remains constant.
What happens if the temperature changes? Since the rate of a
chemical reaction depends on temperature, so does k. Because a chemical
reaction depends on temperature, chemists who study reaction rates
must work at constant temperature. Furthermore, the value of k must
be accompanied by the temperature at which the reaction occurred.
For example, for the second order decomposition of hydrogen iodide,
k = 2.7 x 10° L/(mol-s) at 440°C. When the temperature is increased
to 500°C, k = 3.9 x 10°? L/(mols).
Defining First-Order Reactions
A first-order reaction has an overall order of 1. The decomposition of
dinitrogen pentoxide, N.O;, is an example of a first-order reaction.
2N205(g) > 4NOzq) + 50219)

reactions. For example, consider the following reaction. Explain why.
\ /
(CH3)3CBriaq) + HO ce) > (CH3)30H (aq) + Fi" (aq) + BY (aq)
Experiments have shown that the reaction is first order in (CH3);CBr, and
zero order in water. In other words, the rate of the reaction does not
depend, at all, on the concentration of water. The rate law equation is
written as follows:
Rate = k[(CH3)3CBry|"[H20|°
The overall reaction order is 1 (1 + 0). The reaction is first order.
Chapter 6 Rates of Chemical Reactions» MHR 279
You frequently encounter first-order relationships in everyday
life. For example, if one soft drink costs $1.50, two soft drinks cost
$3.00, three cost $4.50, and so on. This first-order relationship can be
represented by the following equation.
Cost = $1.50 (Number of soft drinks)!

Other Reactions
There are also other types of reactions, besides first-order and second-
order reactions. For example, consider the decomposition of ammonia on
a tungsten, W, catalyst.
Wo
2NH3(g) —"> Noi + 3Ho(g)
The rate law equation for this reaction has been found experimentally.
Rate = k[NH3]° = k
The rate of decomposition of ammonia on a tungsten catalyst is
independent of the concentration of ammonia, since [NH3]° = 1.
In other words, the rate of the reaction is a constant.
Many reactions have overall orders that are higher than 2. Some
reactions have overall orders that are fractions. In this text, however,
you will concentrate on first-order and second-order reactions.
The Initial Rates Method
As you have learned, the values of the exponents in a rate law equation
must be determined experimentally. Chemists determine the values of
m and n by carrying out a series of experiments. Each experiment has a
different, known set of initial concentrations. All other factors, such as
temperature, remain constant. Chemists measure and compare the initial
rate of each reaction. Thus, this method is called the initial rates method.
280 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
There are several reasons for using initial rates. One reason is that
chemists do not need to follow each reaction to its end. This saves time,
especially when studying slow reactions.
Rate Experiments
To see how the initial rates method works, consider the following reaction:
2N205(g) > 2NOxQ) + Or)
The general rate law equation for this reaction is given below.
Rate = k[N205]”"
To determine the value of m, a chemist performs three experiments. A
different initial concentration of dinitrogen pentoxide, [N2Oslo, is used for
each experiment. The subscript 0 represents t = 0. Table 6.2 shows the
results of these experiments.
Table 6.2 Data for Rate Experiments
Experiment Initial [N205]o (mol/L) Initial rate (mol/(L- s))
1 0.010 4.8 x 10°
2 0.020 9.6 x 10°°
3 0.030 1.5 x 10°
The value of m can be determined using at least two different methods. By
inspection, you can see that when the concentration of N2O; is doubled
(experiments 1 and 2), the rate also doubles. When the concentration of
NO; is tripled (experiments 1 and 3), the rate also triples. This indicates
a first-order relationship, as follows:
Rate = k[N2Os]'
Alternatively, you can compare the rate law equation for each experiment
using ratios. This method is useful when the relationship between
concentration and rate is not immediately obvious from the data.
Write the rate expressions for experiments 1 and 2 as follows:
Rate, = k(0.010)”

The reaction is second order with respect to ClO2.
Therefore, the rate law equation is written as follows:

The reaction is second order in ClOsz, first order in OH’, and third
order overall.
Step 2 To find the value of the rate constant, substitute data from any of
the three experiments into the rate law equation. Using the data
from experiment 1 gives the following equation.
1.30 x 10°mol/(L«s) = k(0.0150 mol/L)?(0.0250 mol/L)
Solve for k.

Therefore, the rate constant at the temperature of the
experiment is 231 L?/(mol*-«s). The rate law equation is
Rate = 231 L?/(mol? « s)[CIO,|?;/0H_].
Check Your Solution
To check your values of m and n, solve by inspection. When [ClO] is
constant and [OH| doubles, the rate also doubles and the reaction is first
order in OH’. When [OH] is constant and [ClO,] triples, the rate
increases by a factor of 9. Recall that 3? = 9, indicating a second-order
relationship. To check your value of k, substitute data from experiment
2 or 3. You should get the same answer. Also check the units and the
number of significant digits for k.

The Half-Life of a Reaction
You have seen that a large rate constant indicates a fast reaction, while
a small rate constant indicates a slow reaction. It is not always easy,
however, to determine how long a reaction will take to be completed
just by looking at the value of k. How can you relate the speed of a
reaction to the units of s~’ for a first-order reaction?
The half-life, t,/2, of a reaction is the time that is needed for the
reactant mass or concentration to decrease by one half of its initial
value. The SI units for half-life are seconds. Usually, however, half-life
is expressed in whatever units of time are appropriate to the reaction.
For example, the half-life of a very fast reaction may be measured in
microseconds. The half-life of a slow reaction may be measured in days.
Knowing the half-life of a reaction is an easy way to tell how fast or how
slow a reaction is.
Examine Figure 6.6 to see how half-life and reactant concentration are
related for the first-order decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide.

Beyond Collision Theory
Simple collision theory recognizes that a collision between reactants
is necessary for a reaction to proceed. Does every collision result in a
reaction? Consider a 1 mL sample of gas at room temperature and
atmospheric pressure. In the sample, about 10*° collisions per second take
place between gas molecules. If each collision resulted in a reaction, all
gas phase reactions would be complete in about a nanosecond (107° s)—a
truly explosive rate! As you know from section 6.2, however, gas phase
reactions can occur quite slowly. This suggests that not every collision
between reactants results in a reaction.
In order for a collision between reactants to result in a reaction, the
collision must be effective. An effective collision— one that results in the
formation of products—must satisfy the following two criteria. You will
investigate these criteria over the next few pages.
For a collision to be effective, it must satisfy both of these criteria:
1. correct orientation of reactants
2. sufficient collision energy
Orientation of Reactants
Reacting particles must collide with the proper orientation relative to
one another. This is also known as having the correct collision geometry.
The importance of proper collision geometry can be illustrated by the
following reaction.
NO we) + NO3x(Q) —> NO2z@) + NO 2)
Figure 6.9 shows five of the many possible ways in which NO and NO3
can collide. Only one of these five possibilities has the correct collision
geometry for a reaction to occur. As shown in the figure, only a certain
orientation of reactants prior to collision leads to the formation of two
molecules of nitrogen dioxide.
Activation Energy
In addition to collision geometry, there is a second factor that determines
whether a collision will result in a reaction: the energy of the collision.
The reactants must collide with energy that is sufficient to begin to break
the bonds in the reactants and to begin to form the bonds in the products.
In most reactions, only a small fraction of collisions have sufficient
energy for a reaction to occur. The activation energy, Ea, of a reaction is
the minimum collision energy that is required for a successful reaction.
The collision energy depends on the kinetic energy of the colliding
particles. As you know, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic
energy of the particles in a substance. If you plot the number of collisions

temperatures, more particles
collide with enough energy
to react.
For many reactions, the rate roughly doubles for every 10°C rise in
temperature.
Transition State Theory
Transition state theory is used to explain what happens when molecules
collide in a reaction. It examines the transition, or change, from reactants
to products. The kinetic energy of the reactants is transferred to potential
energy as the reactants collide, due to the law of conservation of energy.
This is analogous to a bouncing basketball. The kinetic energy of the ball
is converted to potential energy, which is stored in the deformed ball as it
hits the floor. The potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the
ball bounces away.
You can represent the increase in potential energy during a chemical
reaction using a potential energy diagram: a diagram that charts the
potential energy of a reaction against the progress of the reaction.
Examples of potential energy diagrams are shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.13
on the next page. The y-axis represents potential energy. The x-axis,
labelled “Reaction progress,” represents the progress of the reaction
through time.
The “hill” in each diagram illustrates the activation energy barrier
of the reaction. A slow reaction has a high activation energy barrier. This
indicates that relatively few reactants have sufficient kinetic energy for
a successful reaction. A fast reaction, by contrast, has a low activation
energy barrier.
A potential energy diagram for an exothermic reaction is shown in
Figure 6.12. The reactants at the beginning of the reaction are at a higher
energy level than the products. The overall difference in potential energy
is the enthalpy change, AH. There is no way to predict the activation
energy of a reaction from its enthalpy change. A highly exothermic reac-
tion may be very slow because it has a high activation energy. Conversely,
a reaction that is very fast may release very little heat. The enthalpy
change of a reaction is determined by finding the overall energy that is

transferred. The activation energy of a reaction is determined by analyzing
the reaction rate.
A potential energy diagram for an endothermic reaction is shown in
Figure 6.13. The reactants at the beginning of the reaction are at a lower
energy level than the products. The overall difference in potential energy
between reactants and products is the enthalpy change.

You may already know that many reactions can proceed in two directions.
For example, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water. Water, however,
can also undergo electrolysis, forming hydrogen and oxygen. This is the
reverse of the first reaction.
Hag) + 50248 —+ H,O~) AH* = —-285.8 kJ
HOw > Hay) + 5 Ox AH? = 285.8 kJ
The enthalpy change of the first reaction is the same as the enthalpy
change of the second reaction, with the opposite sign. (You can show
this using Hess’s law.) How are the activation energies of forward and
reverse reactions related? For an exothermic reaction, the activation
energy of the reverse reaction, Eaey) equals Eafwa) + AH. For an endo-
thermic reaction, Eajev) equals Ea(fwa) - AH. Figures 6.12 and 6.13 show
the activation energies of forward and reverse reactions.
The top of the activation energy barrier on a potential energy diagram
represents the transition state, or change-over point, of the reaction. The
chemical species that exists at the transition state is referred to as the
activated complex. The activated complex is a transitional species that is
neither product nor reactant. It has partial bonds and is highly unstable.
There is a subtle difference between the transition state and the activated
complex. The transition state refers to the top of the “hill” on a potential
energy diagram. The chemical species that exists at this transition point is
called the activated complex.

For a successful reaction to take place, BrCH; and OH” must collide in a
favourable orientation. The OH ion must approach BrCH; from the side
that is opposite to the Br atom. When this occurs, a partial bond is formed
between the O of the OH’ ion and the C atom. Simultaneously, the C— Br
bond is weakened.
Because the activated complex contains partial bonds, it is highly
unstable. It can either break down to form products or it can decompose
to re-form the reactants. The activated complex is like a rock teetering on
top of a mountain. It could fall either way.

Notice that NO; is present in both elementary reactions, but it is not pres-

and consumed in a subsequent elementary reaction are called reaction
intermediates. Even though they are not products or reactants in the over-

place. They are also useful for chemists
who are trying to find evidence to support a proposed reaction mecha-
nism. You will explore this idea in Investigation 6-B.

cules, atoms, or ions) that are involved in an elementary
reaction.

Proposing and Evaluating Mechanisms
You can take apart a grandfather clock to take a look at its mechanism.
You can physically examine and take apart its gears and springs to deter-
mine how it works.
When chemists investigate the mechanism of a reaction, they are
not so lucky. Determining the mechanism of a chemical reaction is a bit
like figuring out how a clock works just by looking at its face and hands.
For this reason, reaction mechanisms are proposed rather than definitively
stated. Much of the experimental evidence that is obtained to support
a mechanism is indirect. Researchers need a lot of creativity as they
propose and test mechanisms.
One of the ways that researchers provide evidence for proposed
mechanisms is by proving the existence of a reaction intermediate.
Although a reaction intermediate usually appears for a very short time
and cannot be isolated, there are other ways to show its presence. For
example, if a reaction intermediate is coloured while other reactants are
colourless, a spectrophotometer will show when the reaction intermediate
is formed. You may even be able to see a fleeting colour change without
a spectrophotometer.
298 MHR-» Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
When chemists propose a mechanism, they must satisfy the
following criteria:
e The equations for the elementary steps must combine to give the
equation for the overall reaction.
e The proposed elementary steps must be reasonable.
e The mechanism must support the experimentally determined rate law.
The Rate-Determining Step
How do chemists determine whether a proposed mechanism supports the
experimentally determined rate law? They must consider how the rates of
the elementary reactions relate to the rate of the overall reaction.
Elementary reactions in mechanisms all have different rates. Usually one
elementary reaction, called the rate-determining step, is much slower.
Hence, it determines the overall rate.
To understand the rate-determining step, consider a two-step process.
Suppose that you and a friend are making buttered toast for a large group
of people. The first step is toasting the bread. The second step is buttering
the toast. Suppose that toasting two slices of bread takes about two
minutes, but buttering the toast takes only a few seconds.
The rate at which the toast is buttered does not have any effect on
the overall rate of making buttered toast, because it is much faster than
the rate at which the bread is toasted. The overall rate of making buttered
toast, therefore, depends only on the rate of toasting the bread. In other
words, two pieces of buttered toast will be ready every two minutes. This
is the same as the rate for the first step in the “buttered toast mechanism.”
Thus, toasting the bread is the rate-determining step in the mechanism.
Step1 Bread — Toast (slow, rate-determining)
Step2 Toast + Butter — Buttered toast (fast)
Now suppose that the butter is frozen nearly solid. It takes you about five
minutes to scrape off enough butter for one piece of toast. Pieces of toast
pile up, waiting to be buttered. In this case, the rate of making buttered
toast depends on the rate of spreading the butter. The rate of toasting is
fast relative to the rate of buttering.
Step1 Bread — Toast (fast)
Step2 Toast + Frozen butter — Buttered toast (slow, rate-determining)
The Rate-Determining Step and the Rate Law
How does the rate-determining step relate to the rate law for the overall
equation? Consider the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with chlorine.
2NO2@g) + Clay) > 2NO2Cliy)
Experiments show that this reaction has the following rate equation.

The proposed mechanism for the reaction is shown below.
Step1 NOzg) + Clog) > NO2Clig) + Cl) (slow)
Step 2 NOzg) + Clg) > NO2Cli) (fast)
The mechanism seems reasonable, because the steps add up to give the
overall reaction. Both steps are plausible, because they are bimolecular
elementary reactions. Does the reaction mechanism support, however, the
experimentally determined rate law?

The first step in the mechanism is slow when compared with the
second step. Therefore, the rate-determining step is step 1. Since the rate
of the overall reaction depends on the rate of the slow step, the rate law

ygrenE
Catalysts
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction
without being consumed by the reaction. Catalysts are of tremendous
importance in all facets of chemistry, from the laboratory to industry.
Many industrial reactions, for example, would not be economically viable
without catalysts. Well over three million tonnes of catalysts are produced
annually in North America.
How a Catalyst Works
A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction so that a
larger fraction of the reactants have sufficient energy to react. It lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternative mechanism for the reaction.
The potential energy diagram in Figure 6.18 shows the activation energy
for an uncatalyzed reaction and the activation energy for the same
reaction with the addition of a catalyst.

In Figure 6.18, the catalyzed reaction consists of a two-step mechanism.
The uncatalyzed reaction consists of a one-step mechanism. To see how
a catalyst works, in general, consider a simple, one-step, bimolecular
reaction:
A+B-A—B
A catalyst can increase the rate of this reaction by providing an alternative
mechanism with lower activation energy. A possible mechanism for the
catalyzed reaction is shown below.
Step 1 A + catalyst — A—catalyst
Step 2 A— catalyst + B > AB + catalyst
Overall reaction A+B-— AB
Both steps are faster than the original, uncatalyzed reaction. Therefore,
although the overall reaction of the catalyzed mechanism has the same
reactants and products as the uncatalyzed reaction, the catalyzed mecha-
nism is faster. The chemical species A — catalyst is a reaction intermediate.
It is produced in step 1 but consumed in step 2. By contrast, the catalyst
is regenerated in the reaction. It appears as a reactant in step 1 and as
302 MHR-« Unit 3 Energy Changes and Rates of Reaction
a product in step 2. Although the catalyst changes during the overall
reaction, it is regenerated unchanged at the end of the overall reaction.
Figure 6.19 shows the reaction of sodium potassium tartrate with
H,O2, catalyzed by cobaltous chloride, CoCl,. The CoCl, is pink in solu-
tion. Notice that the contents of the beaker briefly change colour to dark
green, suggesting the formation of a reaction intermediate. Also notice that
you can see the regeneration of the catalyst when the reaction is over.
Catalysts are divided into two categories, depending on whether or not
they are in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous Catalysts
A homogeneous catalyst exists in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous catalysts most often catalyze gaseous and aqueous
reactions. For example, aqueous zinc chloride, ZnCly, is used to catalyze
the following reaction.
ZNClo(aq)
(CH3)2CHOH (aq) + HCleag) ———_ (CH3)2CHCliag) + H2,0(e)
The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, and the catalyst is soluble in
water. Therefore, ZnCl, is a homogeneous catalyst when it is used with
this reaction.
Heterogeneous Catalysts
A heterogeneous catalyst exists in a phase that is different from the phase
of the reaction it catalyzes. An important industrial use of heterogeneous
catalysts is the addition of hydrogen to an organic compound that
contains C=C double bonds. This process is called hydrogenation.
Consider the hydrogenation of ethylene, shown below.
Pdis)
H.C = CHa(g) + Hog) — H3C — CH3(g)
Without a catalyst, the reaction is very slow. When the reaction is catalyzed
by a metal such as palladium or platinum, however, the rate increases
dramatically. The ethylene and hydrogen molecules form bonds with the
metal surface. This weakens the bonds of the hydrogen and ethylene. The
H—H bonds of the hydrogen molecules break, and the hydrogen atoms are
somewhat stabilized because of their attraction to the metal. The hydrogen tice mee The reaction of

Enzymes are involved in many functions of the human body, including
digestion and metabolism. For example, the enzyme lactase is responsible
for catalyzing the breakdown of lactose, a sugar found in milk. People
who are lactose-intolerant are usually missing lactase, or they have insuf-
ficient amounts. If you are lactose-intolerant, you can take commercially
produced supplements that contain lactase.

In the Thought Lab above, you may have included the enzyme catalase
in your brainstormed list. Catalase in your blood is responsible for the
“fizzing” you see when you use a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution to
disinfect a cut. When dilute hydrogen peroxide is poured on a cut, it
decomposes to oxygen gas and water. The decomposition reaction is
catalyzed by catalase.
Have you ever opened an old bottle of hydrogen peroxide and noticed
that it has lost its potency? The hydrogen peroxide has decomposed, leav-
ing you with a bottle of water. At room temperature, in the absence of a
catalyst, the decomposition of H,O, occurs very slowly, over a period of
months or years. With the help of a catalyst, however, the rate of the reac-
tion can be increased to the point where it can be easily studied in a high
school laboratory.
In Investigation 6-B, you will write a detailed procedure to determine
the rate law for the catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Instead
of using catalase to catalyze the reaction, you will use an inorganic catalyst.

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that chemical reactions usually proceed as a
series of steps called elementary reactions. You related the equations for
elementary reactions to rate laws. You learned how the relative speed of
the steps in a reaction mechanism help to predict the rate law of an over-
all reaction. Finally, you learned howa catalyst controls the rate of a
chemical reaction by providing a lower-energy reaction mechanism. In
this chapter, you compared activation energies of forward and reverse
reactions. In the next unit, you will study, in detail, reactions that proceed
in both directions.

poisoning. The ancient Romans used lead for their plumbing system
(hence, the Latin name for the element). Lead is a poison because it

e A puddle of water remains after a summer shower. The puddle evapo-
rates because some of the water molecules near the surface have enough
kinetic energy to escape from the liquid. At the same time, some water
molecules in the air may condense back into the liquid. The chance
of this happening is small, however. The puddle soon evaporates
completely, as shown in Figure 7.1(A).
e Even if you put a lid on a jar of water, some of the water in the jar
evaporates. Careful measurements show that the level of liquid water
in the jar initially decreases because more water evaporates than
condenses. As the number of water vapour molecules increases,
however, some condense back into the liquid. Eventually, the number
of evaporating molecules and the number of condensing molecules
are equal. The level of water inside the jar remains constant. At this
point, shown in Figure 7.1(B), equilibrium has been reached.
Why is (B) an example of equilibrium, while (A) is not?

e Crystals of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO, « 5H2O, are blue. If
you place a few small crystals in a beaker of water, water molecules
break apart the ions and they enter into the solution. A few ions in
the solution may re-attach to the crystals. Because more ions enter the
solution than re-attach to the crystals, however, all the solid eventually
dissolves. If you keep adding crystals of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate,
the solution eventually becomes saturated. Crystals remain at the
bottom of the beaker, as shown in Figure 7.2.
Which of these systems, (A) or (B), is at equilibrium? Will changing the
temperature affect the concentration of the solution in the equilibrium system?
e Figure 7.3(A) shows a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate. It was
prepared by adding sodium acetate to a saturated aqueous solution. The
mixture was heated to dissolve the added crystals. Finally, the solution
was left to return slowly to room temperature. In Figure 7.3(B), a single
crystal of sodium acetate has been added to the supersaturated solution.
As you can see, solute ions rapidly leave the solution, and solid forms.
These photographs show a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate and the
effect of adding a crystal to it. Is either of these systems at equilibrium?

Conditions That Apply to All Equilibrium Systems
The fundamental requirement for equilibrium is that opposing changes
must occur at the same rate. There are many processes that reach
equilibrium. Three physical processes that reach equilibrium are
e a solid in contact with a solution that contains this solid: for example,
sugar crystals in a saturated aqueous sugar solution
e the vapour above a pure liquid: for example, a closed jar that contains
liquid water
e the vapour above a pure solid: for example, mothballs in a closed drawer
Two chemical processes that reach equilibrium are

called heterogeneous equilibrium.
What is it that equilibrium systems like these have in common? What con-
ditions are necessary for equilibrium to become established? As outlined
in the box below, there are four conditions that apply to all equilibrium
systems.
The Four Conditions That Apply to All Equilibrium Systems
1. Equilibrium is achieved in a reversible process when the rates of
opposing changes are equal. A double arrow, =, indicates reversible
changes. For example:
H20(e) = H20¢)
Hoag) + Clog) = 2HC](g)
2. The observable (macroscopic) properties of a system at equilibrium
are constant. At equilibrium, there is no overall change in the
properties that depend on the total quantity of matter in the
system. Examples of these properties include colour, pressure,
concentration, and pH.
You can summarize the first two equilibrium conditions by stating that
equilibrium involves dynamic change at the molecular level but no change
at the macroscopic level.
3. Equilibrium can only be reached in a closed system. A closed system
is a system that does not allow the input or escape of any component
of the equilibrium system, including energy. For this reason, a
system can be at equilibrium only if it is at constant temperature.
A common example of a closed system is carbon dioxide gas that
is in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide in a soda drink.
326 MHR = Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
The system remains at equilibrium as long as the container is not
opened. Note that small changes to the components of a system are
sometimes negligible. Thus, equilibrium principles can be applied
if a system is not physically closed. For example, consider the
equilibrium of a solid in a saturated aqueous solution, such as
CaOjs) + HO) = Ca**(ag) + 20H (aq). You can neglect the small
amount of water that vaporizes from the open beaker during an
experiment.
4. Equilibrium can be approached from either direction. For example,
the proportions of Ha), Cla), and HCl) (in a closed container at
constant temperature) are the same at equilibrium, regardless of
whether you started with Hy) and Cli.) or whether you started
with HCl.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned how to recognize equilibrium. As well,
you learned about the conditions that are needed for equilibrium to be
reached. Later in this chapter, you will examine what happens when
some equilibrium conditions in a system are changed. You will learn
how chemists can control conditions to increase the yield of reactions.
Energy is an important component of most equilibrium systems. The
input or output of energy in a system causes the temperature to change.
Thus, the requirement that an equilibrium system be closed means that
the temperature of the system must remain constant. In the next section,
you will examine more closely the effects of thermodynamics on
equilibrium systems. In particular, you will examine the factors that
affect the amount of reactant and product in a reaction and the
factors that determine whether or not a reaction is spontaneous.

thermodynamics, free lower at the bottom of the hill than at the top. For the ball to roll uphill—
energy an unfavourable (or non-spontaneous) change—you have to apply energy
to the ball. Chemical reactions are similar. When products have less
enthalpy than reactants, the reaction releases energy. Therefore, the
reaction is exothermic. Are favourable changes those that are exothermic
under certain conditions?
Certainly many favourable physical and chemical changes are
exothermic. Some favourable changes, however, involve no release of
energy. Others are actually endothermic. For example, a favourable
endothermic chemical reaction occurs when barium hydroxide and
ammonium thiocyanate are placed in an Erlenmeyer flask, as shown
in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH), « 8H2O(4) + 2NHASCN(g) > Ba(SCN)o(aq) + 10H20(¢) + 2NH 3)

When the flask is stoppered and the contents are shaken, the solids
intermingle. The reaction produces a slush-like mixture. This favourable,
but endothermic, reaction absorbs enough energy to freeze a thin layer of
water under the flask.

328 =MHR-* Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
Temperature and Favourable Changes
Another condition that determines whether or not a particular reaction is
favoured is temperature. Consider the reversible synthesis reaction
between mercury and oxygen, and the decomposition of mercury(II) oxide.
Hgie) + + Onig) = HgO;) AH =+90.8 kJ
From left to right, the reaction is exothermic. Therefore, the enthalpy
change, AH, is negative. If the enthalpy change was the only condition
that determined whether a reaction is favourable, then the synthesis
reaction would take place. The synthesis reaction does take place—but
only at relatively moderate temperatures. Above 400°C, the reverse
reaction is favourable. The decomposition of HgO;,) occurs. Thus, the
direction in which this reaction proceeds depends on temperature.
This is fundamentally different from the dependence of reaction rate
on temperature that you learned about in Unit 3. The reaction between
Hg), Oz), and HgO;,) does not just change its rate with a change in
temperature, it changes its direction.
Temperature and Enthalpy Alone
Cannot Explain Favourable Reactions
Temperature and enthalpy are not the only conditions that determine
whether a change is favourable. Consider the process shown in Figure 7.5.
A closed valve links two flasks together. The left flask contains an ideal
gas. The right flask is evacuated. When the valve is opened, you expect the
gas to diffuse into the evacuated flask until the pressure in both flasks is
equal. You do not expect to see the reverse process—with all the gas mole-
cules ending up in one of the flasks—unless work is done on the system.
flask with ideal gas evacuated flask ideal gas in both flasks
closed valve open valve
If the gas is ideal, this favourable change involves no change in energy. Why
must the gas be ideal?
The process shown in Figure 7.5 is certainly a favourable change. Yet no
exchange of energy is involved. The condition that influences this change
is called entropy. It is an important condition in all physical and chemical
changes.
Entropy and Favourable Changes
Entropy, S, is the tendency toward randomness or disorder in a system.
It is also a thermodynamic property that can be measured. It can be used
to describe qualitative changes in energy.
An ordered arrangement of particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) has
lower entropy (smaller disorder) than the same number of particles in
random arrangements. Thus, the entropy of a pure substance depends on
its state. The entropy of a system increases (becomes more disordered)
with temperature, because the motion of particles becomes more chaotic
at higher temperatures. See Figure 7.6 on the next page.
Chapter 7 Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium * MHR 329
increasing entropy
The entropy of the particles in a sample of matter increases as the matter
changes state from solid to liquid to gas.
The mathematical definition of entropy describes the probability of a
given arrangement of particles. A system of moving particles with low
entropy probably has greater order than a similar system with higher
entropy. Why say “probably”? Consider gas molecules in a container at
room temperature. The gas molecules are moving rapidly, colliding with
other molecules and the walls of the container. They have relatively large
entropy. What if two different gases occupy the same container’? It is pos-
sible, in principle, for the gases to separate so they are on opposite sides
of the container. Given the huge number of particles, however, the proba-
bility of this happening is so close to zero that chemists say it will never
happen. Nevertheless, it remains possible. The outcome is not certain.
As you know from Unit 3, chemists often use the terms “system” and
“surroundings” to describe a chemical reaction. The system is the reaction
itself—the reactants and products. The surroundings are everything else
in the universe. According to the first law of thermodynamics (the law
of conservation of energy) the algebraic sum of the energy changes in
a system and its surroundings is zero. Unlike energy, entropy is not
conserved. The total amount of entropy is increasing. This is part of the
second law of thermodynamics: the total entropy of the universe is
constantly increasing. The key word here is “total.” If you are studying
a system, you must add together changes in the entropy of the system,
AS.y;, and changes in the entropy of the surroundings, ASsurr.
Consider what happens to you and your classmates (the particles in a
“system”) on your way to class. Initially, you and your classmates are in
different places in the school, walking with different velocities toward the
classroom. Going to class represents a relatively large amount of entropy.
The final state of the system, when everyone is seated, represents a
330 =MHR- Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
smaller amount of entropy. Thus, the entropy of the system decreased.
How, then, did the entropy of the universe increase?
The answer to this question involves changes to the surroundings.
Each of you, on your way to class, metabolized energy. The movement
and heat from your bodies added to the entropy of the air particles around
you. In fact, the increase in the entropy of the surroundings was greater
than the decrease in the entropy of the system. Therefore, the total
entropy of the universe increased.
What does entropy have to do with favourable chemical changes and
equilibrium systems? All favourable changes involve an increase in the
total amount of entropy. Recall the endothermic reaction in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH), « 8H20(s) + 2NHASCN(.) > Ba(SCN)2(aq) + 10H20¢) + 2NH3¢g)
AH =+170 kJ
The reaction is favourable, partly because the reactants are two solids and
the products are a solution, water, and a gas. The products have a much
larger entropy than the reactants. This helps to make the reaction
favourable.
Now recall the reaction between mercury and oxygen. It favours
the formation of HgO below about 400°C, but the decomposition of HgO
above 400°C. This reaction highlights the importance of temperature to
favourable change. Enthalpy, entropy, and temperature are linked in a
concept called free energy.
Free Energy and Equilibrium
Imagine a perfect engine—an engine without any friction between its
moving parts. This engine would still be unable to convert all the energy
in a fuel into useful work. The reason is that some energy, such as the
energy of the hot exhaust, is used to increase the entropy of the surround-
ings. The term free energy means available energy. In a chemical change,
free energy is a measure of the useful work that can be obtained from a
reaction. Free energy is often called Gibbs free energy, and given the
symbol G, in honour of Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903). Gibbs, a
professor of chemistry at Harvard University, developed the concept
of free energy and the equations that describe it.
The change in the free energy of a system, AG, at constant temperature
is given by the equation AG = AH — TAS. In this equation, as in most
chemistry equations, the temperature, T, must be in Kelvin degrees. The
symbol AH represents the change in enthalpy. The symbol AS represents
the change in entropy.

terms related to free energy?
Chapter 7 Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium * MHR_ 331
The equation AG = AH — TAS, and the sign of AG, can help to explain
why some chemical reactions are favourable at room temperature, why
others are not, and how temperature affects the direction of a reaction.
The change in the free energy of a chemical reaction is related
to the direction of the reaction and to equilibrium as follows:
e When AG is negative, the forward reaction is favourable.
e When AG is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium.
e When AG is positive, the reaction is favourable in the reverse direction
but not in the forward direction.
Exothermic reactions are often favourable because the sign of AH is
negative. The equation shows that exothermic reactions are unfavourable
only when AS is negative and the value of —TAS is large enough to make
AG positive. This is what happens in the reaction between mercury
and oxygen.
Hg + $02) > HgO) AH = -90.8 kJ
From left to right, the reaction is exothermic. There is a decrease in
entropy because gas molecules react to form a solid. At temperatures
greater than about 400°C (673 K), the value of —TAS is positive and greater
than 90.8 kJ. Thus, AG becomes positive. The forward reaction is no
longer favourable, as experiments confirm.
In most reactions, the entropy of the system increases (S is positive),
so the value of —TAS is negative. Therefore, most reactions tend to be
more favourable at higher temperatures. At low temperatures, reactions
are likely to be favourable only if they are highly exothermic.
Section Summary
Table 7.1 shows how you can use the signs of AH and AS to determine
whether a chemical reaction is favourable. It also shows how AH and AS
may vary with temperature. Keep in mind that a favourable reaction may
be fast or slow. Thermodynamics makes no prediction about the rate of a
reaction, only whether or not it can take place. Also, before any reaction
begins, the activation energy must be supplied.

Note that the entropy of a system cannot increase forever. Eventually,
a maximum state of disorder is reached. When this happens, the system
appears to have constant properties, even though changes are still taking
place at the molecular level. We say that a chemical system is at equilibri-
um when it has constant observable properties. Therefore, equilibrium
occurs when a system has reached its maximum entropy. In the next
section, you will look more closely at the reactants and products of
chemical systems and learn how equilibrium is measured.

The Equilibrium Constant and Temperature
Adding a chemical that is involved in a reaction at equilibrium increases
the rate at which this chemical reacts. The rate, however, decreases as the
concentration of the added chemical decreases. Eventually, equilibrium
is re-established with the same equilibrium constant. For a given system
at equilibrium, the value of the equilibrium constant depends only on
temperature. Changing the temperature of a reacting mixture changes the
rate of the forward and reverse reactions by different amounts, because
the forward and reverse reactions have different activation energies. A
reacting mixture at one temperature has an equilibrium constant whose
value changes if the mixture is allowed to reach equilibrium at a different
temperature.
The numerical value of the equilibrium constant does not depend
on whether the starting point involves reactants or products. These
are just labels that chemists use to identify particular chemicals in the
reaction mixture. Also, at a given temperature, the value of K, does not
depend on the starting concentrations. The reaction gives the same ratio
of products and reactants according to the equilibrium law. Remember,
however, that K, is calculated using concentration values when the
system is at equilibrium.

Measuring Equilibrium Concentrations
The equilibrium constant, K,, is calculated by substituting equilibrium
concentrations into the equilibrium expression. Experimentally, this
means that a reaction mixture must come to equilibrium. Then one or
more properties are measured. The properties that are measured depend
on the reaction. Common examples for gaseous reactions include colour,
pH, and pressure. From these measurements, the concentrations of the

the net ionic equation is

Because the reaction involves a colour change, you can determine the
concentration of Fe(SCN)**(aq) by measuring the intensity of the colour.
You will find out how to do this in Investigation 7-A. For now, assume
that it can be done. From the measurements of colour intensity, you
can calculate the equilibrium concentration of Fe(SCN)**(aq). Then,
knowing the initial concentration of each solution, you can calculate
the equilibrium concentration of each ion using the chemical equation.
Suppose, for instance, that the initial concentration of Fe**(aq) is
0.0064 mol/L and the initial concentration of SCN (aq) is 0.0010 mol/L.
When the solutions are mixed, the red complex ion forms. By measuring
the intensity of its colour, you can determine that the concentration of
Fe(SCN)**(aq) is 4.5 x 10 mol/L. From the stoichiometry of the equation,
each mole of Fe(SCN)*(aq) forms when equal amounts of Fe*'(aq) and
SCN (aq) react. So, if there is 4.5 x 10 mol/L of Fe(SCN)**(aq) at
equilibrium, then the same amounts of both Fe**(qq) and SCN (aq) must
have reacted. This represents the change in their concentrations. The
equilibrium concentration of a reacting species is the sum of its initial
concentration and the change that results from the reaction. Therefore,
the concentration of Fe**(aq) at equilibrium is (0.0064 — 0.000 45) mol/L =
0.005 95 mol/L, or 0.0060 mol/L. You can calculate the equilibrium
concentration of SCN (aq) the same way, and complete the table below.

brief tips. Each problem also includes a table like the one on page 339 to
organize the data. Because this table is used to record the initial, change,

Qualitatively Interpreting the Equilibrium Constant
The Sample Problem on page 344 showed how to calculate the amounts of
gases at equilibrium for the following reaction.
CO) + H20¢) = Ho¢g) + CO2(g)
Recall that the equilibrium constant for this reaction was 8.3 at 700 K.
1.0 mol of COy) and 1.0 mol of HzO) were put in a 5.0 L container. At
equilibrium, 0.48 mol of Hag) and 0.48 mol of COg,) were present. The
starting amounts were in stoichiometric ratios. Consequently, if the reac-
tion had gone to completion, there would have been no limiting reactant.
You would have expected 1.0 mol of both Hag) and COzg). Thus, you can
calculate the percent yield of the reaction as follows:
Equilibrium [H,] x 100%
Percent yield =
Maximum [Hz]
_ 0.48 x 100%
7 1.0
= 48%
This value indicates the extent of the reaction. It is linked to the size of
K,. As you know, the equilibrium expression is always written with the
product terms over the reactant terms. Therefore, a large K, means that the
concentration of products is larger than the concentration of reactants at
equilibrium. When referring to a reaction with a large K,, chemists often
say that the position of equilibrium lies to the right, or that it favours the
products. Similarly, if K, is small, the concentration of reactants is larger
than the concentration of products. Chemists say that the position of
equilibrium lies to the left, or that it favours reactants. Thus, the
following general statements are true:
e When K > 1, products are favoured. The equilibrium lies far to the right.
Reactions where K is greater than 101° are usually regarded as going to
completion.
e When K = 1, there are approximately equal concentrations of reactants
and products at equilibrium.
e When K < 1, reactants are favoured. The equilibrium lies far to the left.
Reactions in which K is smaller than 107'° are usually regarded as not
taking place at all.
Notice that the subscript “c” has been left off K in these general state-
ments. This reflects the fact that there are other equilibrium constants
that these statements apply to, not just equilibrium constants involving
concentrations. You will learn about other types of equilibrium constants
in the next two chapters. For the rest of this chapter, though, you will
continue to see the subscript “c” used.
348 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
In the Sample Problem and Practice Problems below, you will
consider how temperature affects the extent of a reaction. Keep in mind
that the size of K, is not related to the time that a reaction takes to achieve
equilibrium. Very large values of K, may be associated with reactions
that take place extremely slowly. The time that a reaction takes to reach
equilibrium depends on the rate of the reaction. This is determined by
the size of the activation energy.

The Meaning of a Small Equilibrium Constant
Understanding the meaning of a small equilibrium constant can
sometimes help to simplify a calculation that would otherwise involve
a quadratic equation. When K, is small compared with the initial concen-
tration, the value of the initial concentration minus x is approximately
equal to the initial concentration. Thus, you can ignore x. Of course, if the
initial concentration of a substance is zero, any equilibrium concentration
of the substance, no matter how small, is significant. In general, values
of K, are not measured with accuracy better than 5%. Therefore, making
the approximation is justified if the calculation error you introduce is
less than 5%.
To help you decide whether or not the approximation is justified,
divide the initial concentration by the value of K,. If the answer is greater
than 500, the approximation is justified. If the answer is between 100 and
500, it may be justified. If the answer is less than 100, it is not justified.
The equilibrium expression must be solved in full.

The atmosphere contains large amounts of oxygen and nitrogen. The two
gases do not react, however, at ordinary temperatures. They do react at
high temperatures, such as the temperatures produced by a lightning
flash or a running car engine. In fact, nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases
are a serious pollution problem.

in the mixture at equilibrium?
What Is Required?
You need to find the concentration of NO at equilibrium.
What Is Given?
You have the balanced chemical equation. You know the value of K, and
the following concentrations: [N2] = 0.085 mol/L and [O,] = 0.038 mol/L.
Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Divide the smallest initial concentration by K, to determine
whether you can ignore the change in concentration.
Step 2 Set up an ICE table. Let x represent the change in [N2] and [Og].
Step 3 Write the equilibrium expression. Substitute the equilibrium

First, check your assumption that x is negligible compared with the
initial concentrations. Your assumption is valid because, using the rules
for subtracting measured quantities, 0.038 — (5.8 x 10°) = 0.038. Next,
check the equilibrium values:

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that the equilibrium constant, K,, is a ratio
of product concentrations to reactant concentrations. You used concentra-
tions to find K, and you used Kto find concentrations. You also used an
ICE table to track and summarize the initial, change, and equilibrium
quantities in a reaction. You found that the value of K, is small for reac-
tions that reach equilibrium with a high concentration of reactants, and
the value of K, is large for reactions that reach equilibrium with a low
concentration of reactants. In the next section, you will learn how to
determine whether or not a reaction is at equilibrium, and, if it is not,
in which direction it will go to achieve equilibrium.

You can calculate a value for Q, by substituting the concentration of each
substance into this expression. If the value of Q, is equal to K,, the system
must be at equilibrium. If Q, is greater than K,, the numerator must be
very large. The concentrations of the chemicals on the right side of the
equation must be more than their concentrations at equilibrium. In this
situation, the system attains equilibrium by moving to the left. Conversely,
if Q, is less than K,, the system attains equilibrium by moving to the
right. Figure 7.8 summarizes these relationships between Q, and Ke.

Le Chatelier’s Principle
What happens to a system at equilibrium if the concentration of one of the
reacting chemicals is changed? This question has practical importance,
because many manufacturing processes are continual. Products are
removed and more reactants are added without stopping the process. For
example, consider the Haber process that was mentioned in the previous
Sample Problem.
Now) + 32%) = 2NH3¢)
356 + MHR» Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
At 500°C, K, is 0.40. The gases have the following concentrations:
[N,] = 0.10 mol/L, [H,] = 0.10 mol/L, and [NH3] = 0.0063 mol/L. (You
can check this by calculating Q, and making sure that it is equal to K,.)
Ammonia can be removed from the equilibrium mixture by cooling
because ammonia liquefies at a higher temperature than either nitrogen
or hydrogen. What happens to an equilibrium mixture if some ammonia
is removed? To find out, you need to calculate Q..
Q. = [NH3]?
* [No [H2]?
If ammonia is removed from the equilibrium mixture, the numerator will
decrease, so Q, will be smaller than K,. When Q, < K,, the system attains
equilibrium by moving to the right. Why? The system must respond to
the removal of ammonia by forming more ammonia. Similarly, if nitrogen,
hydrogen, or both were added, the system would re-establish equilibrium
by shifting to the right. As long as the temperature remains constant,
the re-established equilibrium will have the same K, as the original
equilibrium.
A French chemist, Henri Le Chatelier, experimented with various
chemical equilibrium systems. (See Figure 7.9.) In 1888, Le Chatelier
summarized his work on changes to equilibrium systems in a general
statement called Le Chatelier’s principle. It may be stated as follows:
A dynamic equilibrium tends to respond so as to relieve the effect of any
change in the conditions that affect the equilibrium. -

tient. If products are removed from an equilibrium system, more products
must be formed to relieve the change. This is just as you would predict,
because Q, will be less than K,.
Le Chatelier’s principle also predicts what will happen when other
changes are made to an equilibrium system. For example, you can use Le
Chatelier’s principle to predict the effects of changing the volume of a
cylinder that contains a mixture of gases, or the effects of changing the Henri Le Chatelier

The Effect of lons on Aqueous Equilibrium Systems
Many important equilibrium systems involve ions in aqueous solution.
The common ion effect applies Le Chatelier’s principle to ions in aqueous
solution. As its name suggests, the common ion effect involves adding
an ion to a solution in which the ion is already present in solution. It is
really a concentration effect. The equilibrium shifts away from the added
ion, as predicted by Le Chatelier’s principle.
An aqueous solution that contains certain ions can be added to
another solution to form a precipitate, if the ions have low solubility.
For example, adding silver nitrate solution to test for Cl (aq is effective
due to the very low solubility of silver chloride. You can use the precipi-
tation of an insoluble salt to remove almost all of a particular ion from
a solution and, as a result, cause a shift in the position of equilibrium
of the original solution. The common ion effect is important in the
solubility of salts. The precipitation of insoluble salts is used to identify
the presence of unknown ions. You will learn more about the common
ion effect in Chapter 9.
The Effect of Temperature Changes on the Position of Equilibrium
As you know, the value of the equilibrium constant changes with tempera-
ture, because the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are affected.
Le Chatelier’s principle still holds, however. It can be used to predict the
effect of temperature changes on a system when the sign of the enthalpy
change for the reaction is known. For example, the dissociation of sulfur
trioxide is endothermic.
2S03(g) = 250) + Oxy) AH = 197 kJ
As the reaction proceeds from left to right, energy is absorbed by the
chemical system and converted to chemical potential energy. If an
equilibrium mixture of these gases is heated, energy is added to the
system. Le Chatelier’s principle predicts a shift that will relieve the
imposed change. Therefore, the shift will tend to remove the added
energy. This will happen if the equilibrium shifts to the right, increasing
the amount of SOg) and Oxi) formed. As a result, the value of K, will
increase. The shift in equilibrium is consistent (as it must be) with the |
law of conservation of energy.

The Effects of Volume and Pressure Changes on Equilibrium
When the volume of a mixture of gases decreases, the pressure of the
gases must increase. Le Chatelier’s principle predicts a shift in equili-
brium to relieve this change. Therefore, the shift must tend to reduce the
pressure of the gases. Molecules striking the walls of a container cause
gas pressure, so a reduction in gas pressure at constant temperature must
mean fewer gas molecules. Consider the following reaction again.

There are two gas molecules on the left side of the equation.

The overall effect is to lower the activation energy, which increases the
rate of reaction. The activation energy is lowered the same amount for
the forward and reverse reactions, however. There is the same increase
in reaction rates for both reactions. As a result, a catalyst does not affect
the position of equilibrium. It only affects the time that is taken to achieve
equilibrium.
Table 7.2 summarizes the effect of a catalyst, and other effects of
changing conditions, on a system at equilibrium. The Sample Problem
that follows provides an opportunity for you to use Le Chatelier’s

conditions.

What Is Required?
You need to determine whether each change causes the equilibrium to
shift to the left or the right, or whether it has no effect.
What Is Given?

Plan Your Strategy
Identify the change. Then use the chemical equation to determine the
shift in equilibrium that will minimize the change.
Act on Your Strategy
(a) [PCl;] increases. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift to minimize
[PCl;]. The reaction shifts to the right.
(b) [Clz] is reduced. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift to increase
[Cl]. The reaction shifts to the right.
(c) The temperature decreases. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift in
the direction in which the reaction is exothermic. From left to right,
the reaction is endothermic. Thus, the reaction must be exothermic
from right to left. The reaction shifts to the left if the temperature is
decreased.
(d) Helium does not react with any of the gases in the mixture.
The position of equilibrium does not change.
(e) A catalyst has no effect on the position of equilibrium.
Check Your Solution
Check the changes. Any change that affects the equilibrium reaction
must result in a shift that minimizes it.

Applying Le Chatelier's Principle: Manufacturing Ammonia
Industrial processes must be run at optimal conditions to be economic.
This means more than simply manipulating the reaction conditions to
maximize the extent of the reaction. Business people, and the profession-
als they hire to advise them, must consider other factors as well. These
factors include the rate of the reaction, safety, the location of the plant, the
cost to build and operate the plant, the cost of acquiring reactant materi-
als, the cost of transporting products, and the cost of hiring, educating,
and maintaining plant workers.
The chapter introduction mentioned the importance of nitrogen to
plants and animals. Despite nitrogen’s abundance in the atmosphere, its
low reactivity means that there is a limited supply in a form that organ-
isms can use. In nature, bacteria and the energy of lightning supply the
nitrates and other nitrogen compounds that plants need to survive.
Humans use technology to produce these compounds for our extensive
agricultural industry.
In this chapter, you learned about the Haber process for manufactur-
ing ammonia. You used this process to help you understand various
concepts related to equilibrium. As you can see in Figure 7.11, ammonia
is a valuable industrial chemical. Its annual global production is well over
100 million tonnes. The vast majority of ammonia, roughly 80%, is used
to make fertilizers. You will now examine how the equilibrium concepts
you have been studying work together to provide society with a reliable,
cost-effective supply of ammonia.
Before World War I, the main source of nitrates for human use was

Because ammonia is used to manufacture many essential products, it is one of

compounds. What he needed was a method for producing large quantities
of ammonia at minimal cost.
Haber experimented with the direct synthesis of ammonia.
Na) + 3 Ho(g) = 2NH3(g) AH’* = -92 kJ/mol
Because the reaction is exothermic, heat is released as the reaction
proceeds. Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that the yield of ammonia
is greater at lower temperatures. Just as in the contact process for manu-
facturing sulfuric acid, however, high yield is not the only important
factor. The rate of reaction for ammonia synthesis is too slow at low
temperatures.
Le Chatelier’s principle also predicts that the yield of ammonia is
greater at higher pressures. High-pressure plants are expensive to build
and maintain, however. In fact, the first industrial plant that manufactured
ammonia had its reaction vessel blow up. A German chemical engineer,
Carl Bosch, solved this problem by designing a double-walled steel vessel
that could operate at several hundred times atmospheric pressure. Modern
plants operate at pressures in the range of 20 200 kPa to 30 400 kPa.
The gas mixture is kept pressurized in a condenser. (See Figure 7.12.)
Ammonia is removed from the reaction vessel by cooling the gas mixture.
Because of the hydrogen bonding between ammonia molecules, the gas
condenses into a liquid while the nitrogen and hydrogen remain as gases.
Nitrogen is removed to shift the equilibrium toward the production of
more ammonia. Once the ammonia is removed, the gases are recycled
back to the reaction vessel in a continuous operation.

This diagram shows the stages in the Haber-Bosch process for manufacturing

By manipulating the pressure and removing ammonia from the reaction

rate of the reaction, Haber needed to find a catalyst. A catalyst would

The Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases
According to the Arrhenius theory (1887), acids and bases are defined
in terms of their structure and the ions produced when they dissolve
in water.
e An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form H*(aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius acids are hydrochloric acid, HCl, and sulfuric
acid, H2SOu,.
e A base is a substance that dissociates in water to form OH (aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius bases are sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and
potassium hydroxide, KOH.
378 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
The Arrhenius theory explains acid-base reactions as a combination of
H"(aq) and OH(qq). It provides insight into the heat of neutralization for
the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base. (Strong acids and
bases dissociate completely into ions in solution.) For example, consider
the following reaction.
HCliaq) + NaOH aq) > NaCliaq) + H,0v~) AH =-56 kJ
The total ionic equation for this reaction is
(aq) + Cl (aq) + Na‘ (aq) + OH(aq) > Na" (aq) + CI (aq) +H,0j) AH =-56 kJ
Subtracting spectator ions from both sides, the net ionic equation is
FH" (aq) + OH (aq) —> H,Oy~ AH =-56 kJ
Different combinations of strong Arrhenius acids and bases react with the
same exothermic result. Measurements always show the release of 56 kJ of
energy per mole of water formed. This makes sense, because the net ionic
equation is the same regardless of the specific neutralization reaction that
occurs.
The Arrhenius theory has limitations, however. For example, H*(aq),
a bare proton, does not exist in water. The positive charge on a proton is
attracted to the region of negative charge on the lone pair of electrons on
a water molecule’s oxygen atom. The combination is a hydrated proton
called a hydronium ion, H30* (aq).
Haq) + H2,0 (0) > H30" (aq)
The hydronium ion, itself, forms hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules. (See Figure 8.1.) Thus, a better formula for the ion that is
present in acidic solutions is [H(H,O),]*, where n is usually 4 or 5. For
convenience, however, chemists usually use a single hydronium ion
when writing equations.

The Arrhenius theory also has limitations for explaining certain reactions.
For example, aqueous solutions of ammonia are basic. They react with
acids in neutralization reactions, even though ammonia does not contain
the hydroxide ion. Many aqueous solutions of salts with no hydroxide
ions are basic, too. Some reactions take place without any liquid solvent.
For example, ammonium chloride can be formed by the reaction between
ammonia and hydrogen chloride, which are both gases:
NH3¢g) + HCl) => NH,Cljs)
Chapter 8 Acids, Bases, and pH* MHR_ 379
The Bronsted-Lowry Theory
The limitations of the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases are overcome
by a more general theory, called the Brgnsted-Lowry theory. This theory
was proposed independently, in 1923, by Johannes Brgnsted, a Danish
chemist, and Thomas Lowry, an English chemist. It recognizes an
acid-base reaction as a chemical equilibrium, having both a forward
reaction and a reverse reaction that involve the transfer of a proton. The
Bre@nsted-Lowry theory defines acids and bases as follows:
e An acid is a substance from which a proton can be removed. (Some
chemists describe Brgnsted-Lowry acids as “proton-donors.”)
e A base is a substance that can accept a proton. (Some chemists describe
Brensted-Lowry bases as “proton-acceptors.”)
Note that the word “proton” refers to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom — an
H* ion that has been removed from the acid molecule. It does not refer
to a proton removed from the nucleus of another atom, such as oxygen or
sulfur, that may be present in the acid molecule. As mentioned previously,
H* ions share electrons with any species (ion or molecule) that has a lone
pair of electrons. In aqueous solution, the proton bonds with a water
molecule to form the hydronium ion. Unlike the Arrhenius theory,
however, the Brgnsted-Lowry theory is not restricted to aqueous solutions.
For example, the lone pair of electrons on an ammonia molecule can bond
with H*, and liquid ammonia can act as a base.

Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
The dissociation of acetic acid in water is represented in Figure 8.2.
This dissociation is an equilibrium reaction because it proceeds in both
directions. Acetic acid is weak, so only a few ions dissociate. The position
of equilibrium lies to the left, and the reverse reaction is favoured. In
the reverse reaction, the hydronium ion gives up a proton to the acetate
ion. Thus, these ions are an acid and a base, respectively, as shown in
Figure 8.3. The acid on the left (CH3;COOH) and the base on the right
(CH;COO_) differ by one proton. They are called a conjugate acid-base
pair. Similarly, H,0 and H3;0” are a conjugate acid-base pair.

Aqueous ammonia is a weak base, so relatively few hydroxide ions form.
The position of equilibrium lies to the left. In the forward reaction, the
water molecule gives up a proton and acts as an acid. A substance that
can act as a proton donor (an acid) in one reaction and a proton acceptor
(a base) in another reaction is said to be amphoteric. (Water acts as an
acid in the presence of a stronger base, and as a base in the presence of a

Molecular Structure and the Strength of Acids and Bases
When a strong acid or base dissolves in water, almost every acid or base
molecule dissociates. While there are many acids and bases, most are
weak. Thus, the number of strong acids and strong bases is fairly small.
Strong Acids
e binary acids that have the general formula HX(aq), where X = Cl,
Br, and I (but not F): for example, hydrochloric acid, HCl, and
hydrobromic acid, HBr (HCl and HBr are hydrohalic acids: acids
that have hydrogen bonded to atoms of the halogen elements.)
e oxoacids (acids containing oxygen atoms) in which the number of
oxygen atoms exceeds, by two or more, the number of protons that
can be dissociated: for example, nitric acid, HNOs, sulfuric acid,
H2SOgz, perchloric acid, HClO,, and chloric acid, HC1O3
The binary acids of non-metals exhibit periodic trends in their acid
strength, as shown in Figure 8.5. Two factors are responsible for this
trend: the electronegativity of the atom that is bonded to hydrogen,
and the strength of the bond.

The binary acids
show periodic trends, which are
related to electronegativity and
bond strength.
Across a period, electronegativity is the most important factor. The acid
strength of hydrides increases as their electronegativity increases. This
happens because an electronegative atom draws electrons away from the
hydrogen atom, making it relatively positive. The negative pole of a water
molecule then strongly attracts the hydrogen atom and pulls it away.
Down a group, bond strength is the most important factor. Acid
strength increases as bond strength decreases. A weaker bond means that
the hydrogen atom is more easily pulled away from the atom to which it
is attached. For example, hydrofluoric acid is a stronger acid than water,
but HF is the weakest of the hydrohalic acids because the H-F bond is
relatively strong.
Chapter 8 Acids, Bases, and pH* MHR_ 383
Oxoacids increase in strength with increasing numbers of oxygen
atoms, as shown in Figure 8.6. The hydrogen atoms that dissociate
in water are always attached to oxygen atoms. Oxygen is more

The relative strength of oxoacids increases with the number of oxygen atoms.
Acids such as HCl, CH;COOH, and HF are monoprotic acids. They have
only a single hydrogen atom that dissociates in water. Some acids have
more than one hydrogen atom that dissociates. These acids are called
polyprotic acids. For example, sulfuric acid has two hydrogen atoms that
can dissociate.
H2SO0 (aq) + H2,0e) = H30" (aq) + HSOz4 (aq)
HSOg (aq) + H2O( = H3O0% (aq) + SO4 (aq)
Sulfuric acid is a far stronger acid than the hydrogen sulfate ion, because
much more energy is required to remove a proton from a negatively
charged ion. The strength ofa polyprotic acid decreases as the number of
hydrogen atoms that have dissociated increases.
Strong bases are confined to the oxides and hydroxides from Groups 1
(IA) and 2 (IIA).
Strong Bases

hydroxide, NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH
e alkaline earth (Group 2 (IIA)) metal oxides and hydroxides below
beryllium: for example, calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and barium
hydroxide, Ba(OH),
The strong basic oxides have metal atoms with low electronegativity.
Thus, the bond to oxygen is ionic and is relatively easily broken by the
attraction of polar water molecules. The oxide ion always reacts with
water molecules to produce hydroxide ions.
O* (aq) + H20(e) > 20H (aq)
Magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide are not very soluble. They
are strong bases, however, because the small amount that does dissolve
dissociates almost completely into ions. Beryllium oxide is a weak base.
(It is the exception in Group 2 (IIA).) It is a relatively small atom, so the
bond to oxygen is strong and not easily broken by water molecules.

Calculations That Involve Strong Acids and Bases
When a strong acid dissociates completely into ions in water, the
concentration of H3O0*(aq) is equal to the concentration of the strong
acid. Similarly, when a strong base dissociates completely in water, the
concentration of OH (aq) is equal to the concentration of the strong base.
Calculating Ion Concentrations in Acidic and Basic Solutions
Problem
During an experiment, a student pours 25.0 mL of 1.40 mol/L nitric
acid into a beaker that contains 15.0 mL of 2.00 mol/L sodium
hydroxide solution. Is the resulting solution acidic or basic? What is the
concentration of the ion that causes the solution to be acidic or basic?
What Is Required?
You must determine the ion in excess and its concentration.
What Is Given?
You have the following data:
Volume of nitric acid = 25.0 mL
[HNO3] = 1.40 mol/L
Volume of sodium hydroxide = 15.0 mL
[NaOH] = 2.00 mol/L
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1 Write the chemical equation for the reaction.
Step 2 Calculate the amount of each reactant using the following equation.
Amount (in mol) = Concentration (in mol/L) x Volume (in L)
Step 3 Determine the limiting reactant.
Step 4 The reactant in excess is a strong acid or base. Thus, the excess
amount results in the same amount of H;0* or OH’.
Step 5 Calculate the concentration of the excess ion by using the amount
in excess and the total volume of the solution.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 HNOs(aqg) + NaOH(aqg) > NaNOs(aq) + H20(0)
Step2 Amount of HNO3 = 1.40 mol/L x 0.0250 L
= 0.0350 mol
Amount of NaOH = 2.00 mol/L x 0.0150 L
= 0.0300 mol
Step 3 The reactants combine in a 1:1 ratio. The amount of NaOHis less,
so this reactant must be the limiting reactant.
Step4 Amount of excess HNOs(aq) = 0.0350 mol — 0.0300 mol
= 0.005 0 mol
Therefore, the amount of H3O*(aq) is 5.0 x 107° mol.
Step5 Total volume of solution = 25.0 mL + 15.0 mL = 40.0 mL
5.0 x 107° mol
[H30*] =
0.0400 L
= 0.12 mol/L

The solution is acidic, and [H30*] is 0.12 mol/L.

Section Summary
Strong acids and bases (and strong electrolytes) dissociate completely in
water. Therefore, you can use the concentrations of these compounds to
determine the concentrations of the ions they form in aqueous solutions.
You cannot, however, use the concentrations of weak acids, bases, and
electrolytes in the same way. Their solutions contain some particles
that have not dissociated into ions. Nevertheless, important changes in
[H3;0*] and [OH] take place because dissolved ions affect the dissociation
of water.

The equilibrium constant, K,, for the dissociation of water is given by the

So few ions form that the concentration of water is essentially constant.
The product K,[H2O]* is equal to the product of the concentrations of
hydronium ions and hydroxide ions. The equilibrium value of the
concentration ion product [H;0*][OHTM| at 25°C is called the ion product
constant for water. It is given the symbol Ky.
K,[H2O]* = [H30*][OH|
= 1.0 x 10°” mol/L x 1.0 x 107 mol/L
=1.0x 10"
= Ky
The units are commonly dropped, as in other equilibrium expressions you
have encountered.
The concentration of H,0* in the solution of a strong acid is equal
to the concentration of the dissolved acid, unless the solution is very
dilute. Consider [H;0*] in a solution of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid.
All the molecules of HCl dissociate in water, forming a hydronium ion
concentration that equals 0.1 mol/L. The increased [H30*] pushes the
dissociation reaction between water molecules to the left, in accordance
with Le Chatelier’s principle. Consequently, the concentration of hydro-
nium ions that results from the dissociation of water is even less than
1x 107 mol/L. This [H;0*] is negligible compared with the 0.1 mol/L
concentration of the hydrochloric acid. Unless the solution is very dilute
(about 1 x 10°” mol/L), the dissociation of water molecules can be ignored
when determining [H;0*] of a strong acid.
388 =MHR« Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
Similarly, the concentration of hydroxide ions can be determined from
the concentration of the dissolved base. If the solution is a strong base,
you can ignore the dissociation of water molecules when determining
[OH], unless the solution is very dilute. When either [H;0*] or [OHTM] is
known, you can use the ion product constant for water, Ky, to determine
the concentration of the other ion. Although the value of K, for water is
1.0 x 10° at 25°C only, you can use this value unless another value is
given for a different temperature.
[H,0*] and [OH-] in Aqueous Solutions at 25°C
In an acidic solution, [H30*] is greater than 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L and
[OH] is less than 1.0 x 10°” mol/L.
In a neutral solution, both [H;0°] and [OH] are equal to
1.0 x 10°? mol/L.
In a basic solution, [H3;O*] is less than 1.0 x 10-7 mol/L and [OH|
is greater than 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L.

Another Way to Find [H3;0*] and [OH]
You can calculate [H30*] or [OHTM] by finding the antilog of the pH or pOH.
[H;0*] = 10-P#
[OH-] = 10°07
If you are using a calculator, you can use it to find the antilog of a
number in one of two ways. If the logarithm is entered in the calculator,
you can press the two keys (v] and [es] in sequence. (Some calculators
may have a[*] button instead.) Alternatively, since [H,0*] = 10?" and
[OH] = 10-P°", you can enter 10, press the button, enter the negative
value of pH (or pOH), and then press [= }.
Finding pOH, [H3;0°], and [OH]
Problem

medical problems. Suppose that the pH of a urine sample was measured

Solution
You use the known value, pH = 5.53, to calculate the required values.
pOH = 14.00 — 5.53

pH and Ka of a Weak Acid
Table 8.2 lists the acid dissociation constants for selected acids at 25°C.
Notice that weak acids have K, values that are between 1 and about
1 x 10-1. Very weak acids have K, values that are less than 1 x 1077°.
The smaller the value of K,, the less the acid ionizes in aqueous solution.
Problems that involve the concentrations of ions formed in aqueous
solutions are considered to be equilibrium problems. The steps for solving
acid and base equilibrium problems are similar to the steps you learned in
Chapter 7 for solving equilibrium problems.
Solving Equilibrium Problems That Involve Acids and Bases
The steps that you will use to solve acid and base equilibrium prob-
lems will vary depending on the problem. Below are a few general
steps to guide you.
e Write the chemical equation. Use the chemical equation to set up an
ICE table for the reacting substances. Enter any values that are given
in the problem. (Note: For the problems in this textbook, you can
assume that the concentrations of hydronium ions and hydroxide
ions in pure water are negligible compared with the concentrations
of these ions when a weak acid or weak base is dissolved in water.)
e Let x represent the change in concentration of the substance with
the smallest coefficient in the chemical equation.
e For problems that give the initial concentration of the acid, [HA],
compare the initial concentration of the acid with the acid
dissociation constant, K,.

a

e If Al < 500, the change in the initial concentration, x, may

possibly requiring the solution of a quadratic equation.

Percent Dissociation
The percent dissociation of a weak acid is the fraction of acid molecules
that dissociate compared with the initial concentration of the acid,
expressed as a percent. (Some chemists refer to percent dissociation as
percent of dissociation.) The percent dissociation depends on the value
of K, for the acid, as well as the initial concentration of the weak acid.
The following Sample Problems show how to solve problems that involve
percent dissociation.

What Is Required?
You need to calculate the pH of the solution.
What Is Given?
You know the concentration of formic acid:
[HCOOH] = 0.025 mol/L
The acid dissociation constant for formic acid is listed in Table 8.2:
K, =1.8 x 10+
Plan Your Strategy

Check Your Solution
The pH indicates an acidic solution, as expected. Data that was given
in the problem has two significant digits, and the pH has two digits

Polyprotic Acids
As you know, polyprotic acids have more than one hydrogen atom that
dissociates. Each dissociation has a corresponding acid dissociation
constant. How can you calculate the pH of a solution of a polyprotic acid?
Problems that involve polyprotic acids can be divided into as many
sub-problems as there are hydrogen atoms that dissociate. The ion concen-
trations that are calculated for the first dissociation are substituted as
initial ion concentrations for the second dissociation, and so on. You
can see this in the following Sample Problem.
Calculations That Involve Polyprotic Acids

Phosphoric acid, H3PO,, is one of the world’s most important industrial

also the ingredient that gives cola drinks their tart, biting taste. Calculate
the pH, [H2PO,"], and [HPO,?"] of a 3.5 mol/L aqueous solution of
phosphoric acid.
What Is Required?

Check Your Solution
[H30*] results from the first dissociation of phosphoric acid, so the
second dissociation has a negligible effect on the concentration of
hydronium ions or the pH of the solution. You would expect this,
- because the second dissociation is much weaker than the first.
Polyprotic Acids and [H30*]
All polyprotic acids, except sulfuric acid, are weak. Their second
dissociation is much weaker than their first dissociation. For this reason,
when calculating [H30*] and pH of a polyprotic acid, only the first
dissociation needs to be considered. The calculation is then the same as
the calculation for any weak monoprotic acid. In the Sample Problem,
[HPO.2-| was found to be the same as the second dissociation constant,
K,,. The concentration of the anions formed in the second dissociation
ofa polyprotic acid is equal to Ka,.
The only common strong polyprotic acid is sulfuric acid.
Nevertheless, it is strong only for the first dissociation. Like the second
dissociation of other polyprotic acids, the second dissociation of sulfuric
acid is weak.

[H,;0*] in a solution of sulfuric acid is equal to the concentration of the
acid. Only in dilute solutions (less than 1.0 mol/L) does the second disso-
ciation of sulfuric acid contribute to the hydronium ion concentration.

Thus, for an acid and its conjugate base (or a base and its conjugate acid),
KK, = Ky. One interpretation of the result is the stronger an acid, the
weaker its conjugate base must be. This makes sense chemically, because
a strong acid gives up a proton from each molecule. Therefore, its conju-
gate base does not bond with the proton. In summary, then, the strength
of an acid and its conjugate base are inversely related. The conjugate of a
strong acid is always a weak base, and, conversely, the conjugate of a
strong base is always a weak acid.

Buffer Solutions
A solution that contains a weak acid/conjugate base mixture or a weak
base/conjugate acid mixture is called a buffer solution. A buffer solution
resists changes in pH when a moderate amount of an acid or a base is
added to it. (See Figure 8.9.) For example, adding 10 mL of 1.0 mol/L
hydrochloric acid to 1 L of water changes the pH from 7 to about 3, a
difference of 4 units. Adding the same amount of acid to 1 L of buffered
solution might change the pH by only 0.1 unit.

Adding a moderate amount of an acid or a base to a buffer solution causes little
change in pH.
Buffer solutions can be made in two different ways:
1. by using a weak acid and one of its salts: for example, by mixing
acetic acid and sodium acetate
2. by using a weak base and one of its salts: for example, by mixing
ammonia and ammonium chloride
How does a buffer solution resist changes in pH when an acid or a base
is added? Consider a buffer solution that is made using acetic acid and
sodium acetate. Acetic acid is weak, so most of its molecules are not
dissociated and [CH;COOH] is high. Sodium acetate is soluble and a
good electrolyte, so [CH3;COOTM] is also high. Adding an acid or a base has
little effect because the added H30* or OH ions are removed by one of
the components in the buffer solution. The equilibrium of the reactions
between the ions in solution shifts, as predicted by Le ChAatelier’s
principle and described below.
e Adding an acid to a buffer: Acetate ions react with the hydronium
ions added to the solution.
CH3COO (aq) + H30* (aq) = CH3COOH (aq) + H2O0(e)
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right. Here hydronium ions
are removed, by acetate ions, from the sodium acetate component.
e Adding a base to a buffer: Hydroxide ions react with the hydronium
ions that are formed by the dissociation of acetic acid.

terms: acid-base titration know the volumes of both solutions at the equivalence point, and the con-
curve, equivalence point centration of one of them, they can calculate the unknown concentration.
As you can see in Figure 8.11, the equivalence point is the middle of
the steep rise that occurs in a titration curve. The endpoint of a titration
occurs when the indicator changes colour, which happens over a range
of about 2 pH units. The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point.
Therefore, the change in colour usually takes place in a fraction of a
millilitre, with the addition of a single drop of solution. Chemists have
access to a variety of indicators that change colour at different pH values.
The colour changes and ranges for three common indicators are given
in Table 8.4.
Table 8.4 Data on the Endpoints of Three Common Acid-Base Indicators
Indicator Colour change at endpoint Approximate range
bromocresol green yellow to blue 3.8-5.2
methyl red red to yellow 4.3-6.2
phenolphthalein colourless to pink 8.2-10.0
When an indicator is used in a titration, the range of pH values at which
its endpoint occurs must include, or be close to, the equivalence point.
Some representative acid-base titration curves, shown in Figures 8.11,
8.12, and 8.13, will illustrate this point.

Section Summary
In this section, you examined acid-base titration curves for combinations
of strong and weak acids and bases. You may have noticed the absence
of a curve for the reaction of a weak acid with a weak base. A weak
acid-weak base titration curve is difficult to describe quantitatively,
because it has competing equilibria. You may learn about this curve in
future chemistry courses.
Chapter 8 Acids, Bases, and pH* MHR 413
In the next chapter, you will extend your knowledge of equilibria
involving aqueous ions. You will learn how to calculate the pH at an
equivalence point, so you can select an appropriate indicator for any
acid-base titration. You will also learn why equilibrium is important to
the solubility of compounds that are slightly soluble, and how to predict
whether a precipitate will form as the result of a reaction between ions
in solution.

Salts That Dissolve and Form Neutral Solutions
In the following equation, HA(aq) represents a strong acid, which
dissociates completely in water.
HA(ag) + H20( > Hg0% (aq) + A (aq)
Interpreting the equation from right to left, the conjugate base of the
acid, A’, has no tendency to combine with hydronium ions in water.
Therefore, it is a weak base. In fact, the anion that is formed by a strong
acid is a much weaker base than water, so it does not react with water.
Consequently, when a salt that contains the anion of a strong acid is
dissolved in water, the anion has no effect on the pH of the solution.
420 MHR- Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
For example, the conjugate base of hydrochloric acid, HCl, is Cl. The
chloride ion is a very weak base, so it does not react significantly with
water. Therefore, the chloride ion, and the conjugate bases of other strong
acids, do not affect the pH of an aqueous solution.
Similarly, the cations that form strong bases (the alkali metals and
the metals below beryllium in Group 2 (IIA)) do not tend to react with
hydroxide ions. These cations are weaker acids than water. Therefore,
when a salt contains one of these ions (for example, Na‘) the cation has
no effect on the pH of an aqueous solution.
If a salt contains the cation of a strong base and the anion of a strong
acid, neither ion reacts with water. Therefore, the solution has a pH
of 7. Sodium chloride is an example of such a salt. It is formed by the
reaction of sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and hydrochloric acid
(a strong acid). Salts of strong bases and strong acids dissolve in water
and form neutral solutions.
Salts That Dissolve and Form Acidic Solutions
A weak base, such as aqueous ammonia, dissociates very little. Therefore,
the equilibrium lies to the left.
NHavaq) + H,0v) = NH4" (aq) + OH-
Interpreting this equation from right to left, the ammonium ion,
(which is the conjugate acid of aqueous ammonia) is a relatively strong
acid, compared to water. In solution, ammonium ions react with water,
resulting in an acidic solution:
NH4" (aq) + H20 ce) = NHavaq) + H30* (aq)
If a salt consists of the cation of a weak base and the anion of a strong
acid, only the cation reacts with water. The solution has a pH that is less
than 7. Salts of weak bases and strong acids dissolve in water and form
acidic solutions.
Salts That Dissolve and Form Basic Solutions

Salts of Weak Bases and Weak Acids
If a salt consists of the cation of a weak base and the anion of a weak acid,
both ions react with water. The solution is weakly acidic or weakly basic,
depending on the relative strength of the ions that act as the acid
or the base. You can determine which ion is stronger by comparing the
values of K, and K, associated with the cation and the anion, respectively.
If K, > Ky, the solution is acidic. If K, > Ka, the solution is basic.

Sodium Fluoride: A Basic Salt That Protects Teeth
Sugar is a common ingredient in prepared foods. When sugar remains on
your teeth, bacteria in your mouth convert it into an acid. The principal
constituent of tooth enamel is a mineral called hydroxyapatite,
Cajo(PO.1)s(OH)2. Hydroxyapatite reacts with acids to form solvated ions
and water. (Solvated ions are ions surrounded by solvent particles.)
Eventually, a cavity forms in the enamel.
To help prevent acid from damaging tooth enamel, many water treat-
ment plants add small concentrations (about 1 ppm) of salts, such as NaF,

Determine whether the cation is from a strong or weak base, and whether
the anion is from a strong or weak acid. Ions derived from weak bases or

determine which reaction goes farthest to completion.

The equations that represent the reactions with water support the
prediction that NH,NO3 dissolves to form an acidic solution and Na3PO,4
dissolves to form a basic solution. Calcium chloride is the salt of a strong

neutral. Both ions in ammonium hydrogen carbonate react with water.
Because Ky for HCO; is greater than K, for NH,"*, the salt dissolves to

Calculating pH at Equivalence
In an acid-base titration, you carefully measure the volumes of acid and
base that react. Then, knowing the concentration of either the acid or
the base, and the stoichiometric relationship between them, you calculate
the concentration of the other reactant. The equivalence point in the
titration occurs when just enough acid and base have been mixed for a
complete reaction to occur, with no excess of either reactant. As you
learned in Chapter 8, you can find the equivalence point from a graph that
shows pH versus volume of one solution added to the other solution. To
determine the equivalence point experimentally, you need to measure the
pH. Because pH meters are expensive, and the glass electrodes are fragile,
titrations are often performed using an acid-base indicator.
An acid-base indicator is usually a weak, monoprotic organic acid.
The indicator is in equilibrium between the undissociated acid, which is
one colour, and its conjugate base, which is a different colour.
HInaq) + H20¢) = H30* (aq) + In" (aq)
colour 1 colour 2
For example, one indicator, called methyl! red, is red when the pH is
below 4.2, and yellow when the pH is above 6.2. The point in a titration
at which an indicator changes colour is called the end-point. The colour
change occurs over a range of about 2 pH units, but the pH of a solution
changes rapidly near the equivalence point. Often a single drop of base
causes the shift from colour 1 to colour 2. For methyl red, the end-point
occurs over the pH range 4.2 to 6.2. Therefore, this indicator is used when
an acid-base titration results in a moderately acidic solution at equiva-
lence. Figure 9.3 shows the colours and end-points of various indicators.

Thymol blue and alizarin are diprotic. They change colour over two different ranges.
To choose the appropriate indicator for a particular titration, you must
know the approximate pH of the solution at equivalence. As you learned
in Chapter 8, an acid-base titration curve provides this information.
What if you do not have a titration curve? You can calculate the pH at
equivalence using what you know about salts.
Chapter 9 Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria» MHR 425
For example, suppose that you are titrating a strong acid solution
against a weak base. At the equivalence point, the flask contains an
aqueous solution of the salt that is formed by the reaction. The solution of
a salt of a weak base and a strong acid is acidic, so methyl red may be an
appropriate indicator. The pH at equivalence in a titration is the same as
the pH of an aqueous solution of the salt formed.
Calculating pH at Equivalence

2.0 x 10' mL of 0.20 mol/L NHagfaq) is titrated against 0.20 mol/L HCl (aq).
Calculate the pH at equivalence. Use Figure 9.3 to select an
appropriate indicator.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate the pH at equivalence. As well, you need to
find an indicator that changes colour at a pH that is close to the same
pH at equivalence.
What Is Given?
You know that 20 mL of 0.20 mol/L NHa(aq) base reacts with 0.20 mol/L

is needed to react with all the NHa(aq).
Step3 Find the volume of HCl), based on the amount and
concentration of HC] (aq).
Step 4 Calculate the concentration of the salt formed, based on the
amount (in mol) and the total volume of the solution. Decide
which ion reacts with water. Write the equation that represents
the reaction.
Step 5 Determine the equilibrium constant for the ion that is involved
in the reaction. Then divide the [NH,*] by K, to determine
whether the change in concentration of the ammonium ion can
be ignored.
Step 6 Set up an ICE table for the ion that is involved in the reaction with
water. Let x represent the change in the concentration of the ion
that reacts.
Step 7 Write the equilibrium expression. Substitute the equilibrium
concentrations into the expression, and solve for x.
Step 8 Use the value of x to determine the [H;0*]. Then calculate the pH
of the solution. Using Figure 9.3, choose an indicator that changes
colour in a range that includes the pH of the solution.

The salt forms NH4"(aq) and Cl (aq) in solution. NH4*(aq) is the
conjugate acid of a weak base, so it reacts with water. Cl (aq) is
the conjugate base of a strong acid, so it does not react with water.
The pH of the solution is therefore determined by the extent of the
following reaction.

pH values. You learned how to analyze the composition of a salt to
predict whether the salt forms an acidic, basic, or neutral solution.

of salts to calculate the pH at the equivalence point of a titration. You
used the pH to determine a suitable indicator for the titration. In section

constant (Kgp) change is favoured. The same three factors are important for determining
how much of a salt will dissolve in a certain volume of water. These
factors are combined in the following equation, where AG is the change
in free energy of the system.
AG = AH — TAS
As you know from Chapter 7, a change is favoured when AG is negative.
When a salt dissolves, the entropy of the system always increases,
because ions in solution are more disordered than ions in a solid crystal.
An increase in entropy favours the formation of a solution because the
term —TAS is negative. Most solids dissolve to a greater extent at higher
solution temperatures, because the term —TAS becomes more negative.
Explaining the overall enthalpy change for a dissolving salt is more
complicated because it involves a number of energy changes. Cations
must be separated from anions, which requires energy. Water molecules
then surround each ion in solution, which releases energy. If the overall
enthalpy change is negative, the formation of a solution is favoured. If the
enthalpy increases, the formation of a solution is not favoured because AG
is less negative.
Heterogeneous Equilibrium: A Solubility System
Consider barium sulfate, a sparingly soluble salt. X-ray technicians give
patients a barium sulfate suspension to drink before taking an X-ray of the
large intestine. A suspension of barium sulfate is opaque to X-rays, which
helps to define this part of the body. (See Figure 9.4.)

dissolving, occurs at a greater rate than the reverse change:
BaSOa(s) = Ba?" (aq) + S047 (aq)
430 MHR-» Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
As more ions enter the solution, the rate of the reverse change,
recrystallisation, increases. Eventually, the rate of recrystallisation becomes
equal to the rate of dissolving. As you know, when the forward rate and
the backward rate of a process are equal, the system is at equilibrium.
Because the reactants and the products are in different phases, the reaction
is said to have reached heterogeneous equilibrium. For solubility systems
of sparingly soluble ionic compounds, equilibrium exists between the solid
ionic compound and its dissociated ions in solution.
The Solubility Product Constant
When excess solid is present in a saturated solution, you can write the
equilibrium constant expression for the dissolution of the solid in the
same way that you wrote the equilibrium constant expression for a
homogeneous equilibrium in Chapter 7. For example, the equilibrium
constant expression for barium sulfate is written as follows:
[Ba** (aq) I[SO4* (aq)!
K=
[BaSOa5)]
The concentration of a solid, however, is itself a constant at a constant
temperature. Therefore, you can combine the term for the concentration
of the solid with the equilibrium constant to arrive at a new constant:
K|[BaSOus)] = [Ba7*,aq][SOx” (aq)!
Ksp = [Ba**(aq)| [SO4” (aq)
The new constant is called the solubility product constant, K,).

In Investigation 9-A, you will collect solubility data and use these data to

you assume that the dissolved ionic compound exists as independent
hydrated ions that do not affect one another. This assumption simplifies
the investigation, but it is not entirely accurate. Ions do interfere with
one another. As a result, the value of K,, that you calculate will be just
an approximation. K,, values that are calculated from data obtained
from experiments such as Investgation 9-A are generally higher than the
actual values.

The Common Ion Effect
So far, you have considered solubility equilibria for pure substances
dissolved in water. What happens to the solubility of an ionic compound
when it is added to a solution that already contains one of its ions?
Consider a saturated solution of lead(II) chromate. See Figure 9.5(A)
on the next page. The following equation represents this equilibrium.
PbCrO.(5) = Pb** (aq) + CrO4” (aq)
436 MHR-« Unit 4 Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
A solution of a salt that contains chromate ions, such as sodium
chromate, NagCrOa(aq), is added to the mixture. More yellow lead{II)
chromate precipitates out of solution, as shown in Figure 9.5(B).
As you learned in Chapter 8, this phenomenon is called the common
ion effect. The observed result is predicted by Le Chatelier’s principle.
Adding a common ion to a solution increases the concentration of that ion
in solution. As a result, equilibrium shifts away from the ion. In this
example, adding chromate ions causes the equilibrium to shift to the left,
and lead(IJ) chromate precipitates.

Analyzing the expression for the solubility product constant gives the
same result.
Kgp = [Pb**][CrO,”|
= 2.3 x 10° at 25°C
Since K,, is a constant at a given temperature, an increase in the
concentration of one ion must be accompanied by a decrease in the
concentration of the other ion, achieved by the formation of a precipitate.
This explains why solid lead(II) chromate precipitates out of solution.
The next Sample Problem shows how to predict the solubility of an
ionic compound when a common ion is present in solution.

(the common ion) that is contributed by PbCrOg. Initial conditions
are based on the solution of NazCrOx,.
Step 4 Solve for x, and check your prediction.

(a) Based on Le Chatelier’s principle, the solubility of PbCrO, in a

the solubility of PbCrO, in water.

Step 4 Since K,p) is very small, you can assume that x is much smaller
than 0.10. To check the validity of this assumption, determine
whether or not 0.10 is more than 500 times greater than Kg):
0.10 _ 0.10
Ky 2.38 x 10°"°
= 4.3 x 10'' > 500
Therefore, in the (0.10 + x) term, x can be ignored. In other words,
(0.10 + x) is approximately equal to 0.10. Therefore, you can
simplify the equation as follows:
Ksp = [Pb**][CrO47"] = 2.3 x 107?
= (x)(0.10 + x)
= (x)(0.10)
.(x)(0.10) = 2.3 x 1078
x = 2.3 x 10% mol/L
The molar solubility of PbCrO, in a solution of 0.10 mol/L
NagCrO, is 2.3 x 10-'* mol/L. Your prediction was correct. The
solubility of PbCrO, decreases in a solution of common ions.
Check Your Solution
The approximation in step 4 is reasonable. The solubility of x is much
smaller than 0.10. To prove that the approximation works, substitute the
calculated value of x into the initial expression for Kg).

Since buffers are an example of the common-ion effect, the concentra-
tion of ions (hence the pH) of a buffer solution can be calculated using a
method that is similar to the method you used to determine solubility in a
common ion effect problem. You will use K,, however, instead of Ksp.
Also, buffers are in homogeneous equilibria, unlike saturated solubility
systems, which are in heterogeneous equilibria. Therefore, you need to
consider the initial concentration of the reactants. (The reactants are not
solids, so their concentration is not constant.)

are not necessarily those at equilibrium. (The relationship between the
expression for solubility product, K,,, and the expression for the ion
product, Qs, is analogous to the relationship between the equilibrium
constant, K,, and the reaction quotient, Q..)
For example, suppose that you slowly add an ionic compound,
such as magnesium sulfate, MgSO,, to water in a beaker. The following
equation represents the dissociation.
MgSO...) = Mg**(aq) + SO4? (aq) Kep = 5.9 x 1079
Initially, all the magnesium sulfate dissolves. The solution is not at
equilibrium as long as more solid can dissolve. As you add more solid,
however, the solution reaches equilibrium. The solution is saturated,
and no more salt will dissolve. If you continue to add magnesium sulfate
to the water, you will see an increasing amount of solid in the beaker.
The ion product expression for magnesium sulfate is written
as follows:
Qsp = [Mg?*] [SO.* |]
You calculate Q, by substituting the concentration of each ion into
the expression. If Q, is larger than K,, the product of the concentrations of
the ions is greater than it would be at equilibrium. For the system to attain
equilibrium, some of the ions must leave the solution by precipitation.
Conversely, if Q, is less than K,,, the product of the concentration of the
ions is smaller than it is at equilibrium. Therefore, the solution is not yet
saturated and more ions can be added to the solution without any
precipitation. The relationship between Q, and Kj, for the dissociation of
a slightly soluble ionic compound is summarized on the next page. Use the
following general equation as a reference.

e A precipitate forms until equilibrium is reached.
Using the lon Product Expression
You can use the relationship between the ion product expression and the
solubility product expression to predict whether a precipitate will form
in a given system. One common system involves mixing solutions of two
soluble ionic compounds, which react to form an ionic compound with a
very low solubility. If Q, > Kp, based on the initial concentrations of the
ions in solution, the sparingly soluble compound will form a precipitate.
How do you know which ionic compounds are soluble and which are
not? In your previous chemistry course, you learned a set of solubility
guidelines. Table 9.3 summarizes these guidelines. Remember: the higher
guideline takes precedence. (For instance, guideline 3 says that carbonates
have very low solubility. Sodium carbonate is soluble, however, because
guideline 1 says that ionic compounds containing sodium are soluble.)
Chemists do not usually work with solubility products for soluble
compounds. Thus, you will not find soluble ionic compounds listed in Aj,
tables. If you see a compound in a &,, table, you know that it has a low
solubility relative to compounds such as sodium chloride.

Analytical Applications of Precipitation Reactions
In the previous Sample Problems, you saw that combining solutions of
soluble ionic compounds can cause the precipitation of a slightly soluble
ionic compound. Analytical chemists use precipitation reactions to
remove ions from solution or to identify ions in an unknown solution.
Fractional Precipitation
Suppose a chemist has a solution that contains several similar ions. The
chemist wants to remove some of these ions, while leaving other ions in
solution. One way to do this is by fractional precipitation: a process in
which ions are selectively precipitated from solution, leaving other ions.
For example, consider a solution that contains three halide ions: CI,
Br, and [-. Since these halides all come from the same group on the
periodic table, they share many properties. When they are the anions in
slightly soluble ionic compounds, however, they have different solubilities.
(See Table 9.4.) Therefore, chemists can use fractional precipitation to
separate them from solution.
Table 9.4 Values of Ks, for Silver Halides
Silver halide | Kep
AgCl 1.8 x 1071°
AgBr 3.3 x 10718
Agl 1.5 x 10°76
Out of the three compounds, silver chloride is the most soluble and
silver iodide is the least soluble. (You can compare the solubilities of
the compounds based on their solubility products because they are all
the same type. Each formula unit contains two ions.)
To separate the halide ions, a chemist adds silver ions to the solution
until most of the iodide ions precipitate out as AgIl. The chemist stops
adding silver ions before AgBr begins to precipitate. The chemist then
removes the solid Agl by filtration or by using a centrifuge, as shown in
Figure 9.8. To remove the bromide ions, the chemist repeats the process
with the remaining solution. The chemist adds silver ions until most of
the bromide ions precipitate out as AgBr, but stops adding ions before
AgCl begins to precipitate. By filtering or centrifuging again, the chemist
obtains a solution that contains only chloride ions.
tiie: s-@ Chemists use a
centrifuge to separate a precipitate
from a solution. The centrifuge
spins the samples quickly, and the
resulting force pushes the precipi-
tate to the bottom of the test tube.
The solution can then be decanted.

examining the identification of cations through precipitation reactions
allows you to see how solubility equilibria can be manipulated. It also
provides an opportunity to solve a chemical “mystery”—what is in the
unknown solution?
To find out what cations are in a solution using precipitation reactions,
chemists carry out reactions according to a scheme that incorporates tests
for each component that may be present. One example of such a scheme is
shown in Figure 9.9. This scheme shows how a chemist would analyze an
unknown solution that may contain all, some, or none of the following

Chapter 9 Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria» MHR 449
The scheme that is shown in Figure 9.9 is very simple. More complex
qualitative analyses involve many more steps of isolation and identifica-
tion, including some steps that are not precipitation reactions. For
example, some ions, such as sodium, Na‘, and potassium, K*, cannot be
precipitated out of an aqueous solution, because the ionic compounds that
contain them are always soluble. Instead, chemists identify these ions
using a flame test. In the following ThoughtLab, you will simulate a

An Issue to
Earth in Equilibrium
Background
Scientists often think about Earth as being composed
of four main systems. The biosphere includes all
living things on Earth. The geosphere includes
non-living things, such as rocks and soil. The
hydrosphere includes all water, such as oceans,
rivers, and even puddles. The atmosphere includes
gases, vapours, and aerosols. These four systems
overlap in many ways. For example, animals are part
of the biosphere, but they interact with components
in the geosphere (living in a burrow or cave), the
hydrosphere (drinking and excreting water), and the
atmosphere (breathing).
Scientists have noticed various shifts in Earth’s
equilibrium in recent years. Since Earth is in a
dynamic equilibrium, some shifts occur naturally.
There is considerable evidence, however, that the
following shifts have been caused by, or at least
strongly influenced by, human activities. Some of
these shifts may be familiar to you, with names
such as “global warming,” 99 66“ozone holes,” and “loss
of biodiversity.”
Earth, with its four spheres, is a good approximation e an increase in CO, and CH, levels in the
of a closed system. As you learned in Unit 4, a atmosphere

increase in desert land
¢ a loss of plant and animal species, both by
observable causes and by unknown causes

such as hurricanes and tornadoes
For this unit issue, you will research the carbon
cycle, either on your own or as part of a group.
Then, as a class, you will discuss the consequences
of human activities on the carbon cycle.

Half-Reactions
To monitor the transfer of electrons in a redox reaction, you can
represent the oxidation and reduction separately. A half-reaction is a
balanced equation that shows the number of electrons involved in either
oxidation or reduction. Because a redox reaction involves both oxidation
and reduction, two half-reactions are needed to represent a redox reaction.
One half-reaction shows oxidation, and the other half-reaction shows
reduction.
As you saw earlier, the reaction of zinc with aqueous copper(II) sulfate
can be represented by the following net ionic equation.

If you look again at each half-reaction above, you will notice that
the atoms and the charges are balanced. Like other types of balanced
equations, half-reactions are balanced using the smallest possible
whole-number coefficients. In the following equation, the atoms and
charges are balanced, but the coefficients can all be divided by 2 to give
the usual form of the half-reaction.

Chapter 10 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions » MHR 467
In most redox reactions, one substance is oxidized and a different
substance is reduced. In a disproportionation reaction, however, a single
element undergoes both oxidation and reduction in the same reaction.
For example, a copper(I) solution undergoes disproportionation in the
following reaction.

You have learned that half-reactions can be used to represent oxidation
and reduction separately. Half-reactions always come in pairs: an oxidation
half-reaction is always accompanied by a reduction half-reaction, and vice
versa. Try writing and balancing half-reactions using the following practice
problems.

Aging: Is Oxidation a Factor?
Why do we grow old? Despite advances in
molecular biology and medical research, the
reasons for aging remain mysterious. One
theory suggests that aging may be influenced
by oxidizing agents, also known as oxidants.
Oxidants are present in the environment
and in foods. Nitrogen oxides are oxidants
present in cigarette smoke and urban smog.
Other oxidants include the copper and iron
salts in meat and some plants. Inhaling and
ingesting oxidants such as these can increase
the level of oxidants in our bodies.
Oxidants are also naturally present in
the body, where they participate in important
redox reactions. For example, mitochondria Carotenoids are pigments found in some fruits and

Oxidation Numbers from Lewis Structures
You are probably familiar with the Lewis structure of water, shown in
Figure 10.4A. From the electronegativities on the periodic table in
Figure 10.5, on the next page, you can see that oxygen (electronegativity
3.44) is more electronegative than hydrogen (electronegativity 2.20). The
electronegativity difference is less than 1.7, so the two hydrogen-oxygen
bonds are polar covalent, not ionic. In each bond, the electrons are more
strongly attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atom.

Chapter 10 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions» MHR 473
To assign oxidation numbers to the atoms in a water molecule, you
can consider all the bonding electrons to be “owned” by the more elec-
tronegative oxygen atom, as shown in Figure 10.4B. Thus, each hydrogen
atom in a water molecule is considered to have no electrons, as hydrogen
would in a hydrogen ion, H*. Therefore, the element hydrogen is assigned
an oxidation number of +1 in water. On the other hand, the oxygen atom
in a water molecule is considered to have a filled octet of electrons, as
oxygen would in an oxide ion, O*-. Therefore, the element oxygen is
assigned an oxidation number of —2 in water. (Note: These are not ionic
charges, since water is a covalent molecule. Also, note that the plus or
minus sign in an oxidation number, such as —2, is written before the
number. The plus or minus sign in an ionic charge, such as 2-, is written
after the number.)
GETTEEEY The periodic table, showing electronegativity values
In a chlorine molecule, Cl:, each atom has the same electronegativity, so
the bond is non-polar covalent. Because the electrons are equally shared,
you can consider each chlorine atom to “own” one of the shared elec-
trons, as shown in Figure 10.6. Thus, each chlorine atom in the molecule
is considered to have the same number of electrons as a neutral chlorine
atom. Each chlorine atom is therefore assigned an oxidation number of 0.

Figure 10.7 shows how oxidation numbers are assigned for the
polyatomic cyanide ion, CN. The electronegativity of nitrogen (3.04) is
greater than the electronegativity of carbon (2.55). Thus, the three shared
pairs of electrons are all considered to belong to the nitrogen atom. As
a result, the carbon atom is considered to have two valence electrons,
which is two electrons less than the four valence electrons of a neutral
carbon atom. Therefore, the carbon atom in CN” is assigned an oxidation
number of +2. The nitrogen atom is considered to have eight valence
electrons, which is three electrons more than the five valence electrons of
a neutral nitrogen atom. Therefore, the nitrogen atom in CN” is assigned
an oxidation number of —3.

Using Rules to Find Oxidation Numbers
Drawing Lewis structures to assign oxidation numbers can be a very
time-consuming process for large molecules or large polyatomic ions.
Instead, the results from Lewis structures have been summarized to
produce a more convenient set of rules, which can be applied more
quickly. Table 10.1 summarizes the rules used to assign oxidation
numbers. You may have discovered some of these rules for yourself in
the ThoughtLab you just completed.

Some oxidation numbers found using these rules are not integers. For
example, an important iron ore called magnetite has the formula Fe3Q,.
Using the oxidation number rules, you can assign oxygen an oxidation
number of —2, and calculate an oxidation number of +o for iron. However,
magnetite contains no iron atoms with this oxidation number. It actually
contains iron(III) ions and iron(II) ions in a 2:1 ratio. The formula of
magnetite is sometimes written as Fe,0;3 «FeO to indicate that there are
two different oxidation numbers. The value +4 for the oxidation number
of iron is an average value.
2(+3) + (+2) 8

Even though some oxidation numbers found using these rules are
averages, the rules are still useful for monitoring electron transfers in
redox reactions.

Each atom or ion shown in the net ionic equation can be assigned
an oxidation number. Zn has an oxidation number of 0; Cu2* has an
oxidation number of +2; Cu has an oxidation number of 0; and Zn?* has
an oxidation number of +2. Thus, there are changes in oxidation numbers
in this reaction. The oxidation number of zinc increases, while the
oxidation number of copper decreases.

You have seen many balanced chemical equations and net ionic equations

these equations. These techniques are especially useful for reactions that

used in coating a master CD with silver.
In section 10.1, you learned to divide the balanced equations for some
redox reactions into separate oxidation and reduction half-reactions. You

Redox reactions do not always take place under neutral conditions.
Balancing half-reactions is more complicated for reactions that take place
in acidic or basic solutions. When an acid or base is present, H* or OH”
ions must also be considered. However, the overall approach is similar.
This approach involves writing the correct formulas for the reactants and
products, balancing the atoms, and adding the appropriate number of
electrons to one side of the half-reaction to balance the charges.

Half-Reaction Method for Balancing Redox Reactions
Recall that, if you consider a redox reaction as two half-reactions,
electrons are lost in the oxidation half-reaction, and electrons are gained
in the reduction half-reaction. For example, you know the reaction of
zinc with aqueous copper(II) sulfate.
Zs) + CuSOa(ag) > Cus) + ZNSO4(aq)
Removing the spectator ions leaves the following net ionic equation.
ZYs) + Cu** (ag) => Cus) + Zn* (aq)
e You can break the net ionic equation into two half-reactions:
Oxidation half-reaction: Zn —> Zn?* + 2e7
Reduction half-reaction: Cu2* + 2e° > Cu
e You can also start with the half-reactions and use them to produce a net
ionic equation. If you add the two half-reactions, the result is as follows.
Zn + Cu2* + 2e > Cu + Zn2* + 2e7
Removing the two electrons from each side results in the original net
ionic equation.
As shown above, you can use half-reactions to write balanced net
ionic equations for redox reactions. In doing so, you use the fact that
no electrons are created or destroyed in a redox reaction. Electrons
are transferred from one reactant (the reducing agent) to another (the
oxidizing agent).
Balancing a Net lonic Equation
You know from Investigation 10-A that magnesium metal, Mg), displaces
aluminum from an aqueous solution of one of its compounds, such as
aluminum nitrate, Al(NO3)3(aq). To obtain a balanced net ionic equation
for this reaction, you can start by looking at the half-reactions. Magnesium
atoms undergo oxidation to form magnesium ions, which have a 2+
charge. The oxidation half-reaction is as follows.
Mg — Mg?* + 2e7
Aluminum ions, which have a 3+ charge, undergo reduction to form
aluminum atoms. The reduction half-reaction is as follows.
Al?* + 3e > Al

if necessary. The balanced chemical equation is:

Steps for Balancing by the Half-Reaction Method
You could balance the chemical equation for the reaction of magnesium
with aluminum nitrate by inspection, instead of writing half-reactions.
However, many redox equations are difficult to balance by the inspection
method. In general, you can balance the net ionic equation for a redox
reaction by a process known as the half-reaction method. The preceding
example of the reaction of magnesium with aluminum nitrate illustrates
this method. Specific steps for following the half-reaction method are
given below.
Step 1 Write an unbalanced net ionic equation, if it is not already
given.
Step 2 Divide the unbalanced net ionic equation into an oxidation
half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction. To do this, you
may need to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in
the net ionic equation to determine what is oxidized and what
is reduced.
Step 3 Balance the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction independently.
Step 4 Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers
of electrons in the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction.
Continued on the next page
Chapter 10 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions *»MHR 487
Step 5 Use coefficients to write each half-reaction so that it includes
the LCM of the numbers of electrons.
Step 6 Add the balanced half-reactions that include the equal num-
bers of electrons.
Step 7 Remove the electrons from both sides of the equation.
Step 8 Remove any identical molecules or ions that are present on
both sides of the equation.
Step 9 If you require a balanced chemical equation, include any
spectator ions in the chemical formulas.
Step 10 If necessary, include the states.
When using the half-reaction method, keep in mind that, in a redox
reaction, the number of electrons lost through oxidation must equal the
number of electrons gained through reduction. Figure 10.11 provides
another example.

Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic and Basic Solutions
The half-reaction method of balancing equations can be more complicated
for reactions that take place under acidic or basic conditions. The overall
approach, however, is the same. You need to balance the two half-reactions,
find the LCM of the numbers of electrons, and then multiply by coefficients
to equate the number of electrons lost and gained. Finally, add the half-
reactions and simplify to give a balanced net ionic equation for the
reaction. The ten steps listed above show this process in more detail.

As blood moves through the lungs, it comes

contains alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in
the blood quickly reaches equilibrium with the
concentration of alcohol in each inhaled breath.
Thus, the alcohol content in an exhaled breath is a

about the same amount of alcohol as 1 mL of blood.

in section 10.3, you sometimes used oxidation numbers to determine the redox reactions using the
reactant(s) and product(s) in each half-reaction. oxidation number method
In fact, you can use oxidation numbers to balance a chemical
equation by a new method. The oxidation number method is a method
of balancing redox equations by ensuring that the total increase in the
oxidation numbers of the oxidized element(s) equals the total decrease
in the oxidation numbers of the reduced element(s).
For example, the combustion of ammonia in oxygen produces nitrogen
dioxide and water.
NH; + O, ~ NO» + H,O
341 0 4-20 41-2
The oxidation number of nitrogen increases from —3 to +4, an increase
of 7. The oxidation number of oxygen decreases from 0 to —2, a decrease
of 2. The least common multiple of 7 and 2 is 14. In this case, two
nitrogen atoms must react for every seven oxygen atoms so that the total
increase and decrease in oxidation numbers both equal 14.
2NH, + £0, > NO; + H,0
Complete the equation by inspection. If necessary, eliminate the fraction.
2NH, + 0, > 2NO, + 3H,0
4NH3 + 702 — 4NO2 + 6H20
A summary of the steps of the oxidation number method is given below.
The following Sample Problem shows how these steps are applied.
Step1 Write an unbalanced equation, if it is not given.
Step 2 Determine whether the reaction is a redox reaction by
assigning an oxidation number to each element wherever it
appears in the equation.
Step 3 If the reaction is a redox reaction, identify the element(s) that
undergo an increase in oxidation number and the element(s)
that undergo a decrease in oxidation number.
Step 4 Find the numerical values of the increase and the decrease in
oxidation numbers.
Step5 Determine the smallest whole-number ratio of the oxidized and
reduced elements so that the total increase in oxidation num-
bers equals the total decrease in oxidation numbers.
Step 6 Use the smallest whole-number ratio to balance the numbers of
atoms of the element(s) oxidized and the element(s) reduced.

Balancing a Redox Equation in Basic Solution
Problem
Write a balanced net ionic equation to show the formation of iodine by

Solution
Step 1 Write an unbalanced equation from the given information.
O.+lFT> I,
Step 2 Assign oxidation numbers to see if it is a redox reaction.
O.+T oI
0 -1 0
Because iodide is oxidized to iodine, the reaction is a redox
reaction. Though the product that contains oxygen is unknown
at this stage, oxygen must be reduced.
Step 3 Iodine is the element that undergoes an increase in oxidation
number. Oxygen is the element that undergoes a decrease in
oxidation number.
Step 4 Iodine undergoes an increase in its oxidation number from
—1 to 0, an increase of 1. Assume that the oxidation number of
oxygen after reduction is its normal value, that is, -2. Thus,
oxygen undergoes a decrease in its oxidation number from
O to —2, a decrease of 2.
Step5 A 2:1 ratio of iodine atoms to oxygen atoms ensures that the total
increase in oxidation numbers and the total decrease in
oxidation numbers are both equal to 2. This is the smallest
whole-number ratio.
Step 6 Use the ratio to balance the numbers of atoms of iodine and oxy-
gen. Make sure there are two iodine atoms for every oxygen atom.

example, zinc atoms undergo oxidation at the zinc electrode. Thus, the
zinc electrode is the anode of the Daniell cell. The electrode at which
reduction occurs is named the cathode. Here, copper(II) ions undergo
reduction at the copper electrode. Thus, the copper electrode is the
cathode of the Daniell cell.
Free electrons cannot travel through the solution. Instead, the external
circuit conducts electrons from the anode to the cathode of a galvanic
cell. Figure 11.2 gives a diagram of a typical galvanic cell.

cell, such as the Daniell cell shown
here, includes two electrodes,
electrolyte solutions, a porous
barrier, and an external circuit.
Electrons flow through the external
circuit from the negative anode to
the positive cathode.
At the anode of a galvanic cell, electrons are released by oxidation.
For example, at the zinc anode of the Daniell cell, zinc atoms release
electrons to become positive zinc ions. Thus, the anode of a galvanic
cell is negatively charged. Relative to the anode, the cathode of a galvanic
cell is positively charged. In galvanic cells, electrons flow through the
external circuit from the negative electrode to the positive electrode.
These electrode polarities may already be familiar to you. An example
is shown in Figure 11.3.
Each half-cell contains a solution of a neutral compound. In a
Daniell cell, these solutions are aqueous zinc sulfate and aqueous

The separator between the half-cells does not need to be a porous barrier.
Figure 11.5 shows an alternative device. This device, called a salt bridge,

The open ends of the salt bridge are plugged with a porous material, such
as glass wool, to stop the electrolyte from leaking out quickly. The plugs

Suppose the salt bridge of a Daniell cell contains ammonium chloride
solution, NH,Cl(aq). As positive zinc ions are produced at the anode,
negative chloride ions migrate from the salt bridge into the half-cell that
contains the anode. As positive copper(II ions are removed from solution
at the cathode, positive ammonium ions migrate from the salt bridge into
the half-cell that contains the cathode.
Other electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate or potassium nitrate, could
be chosen for the salt bridge. Neither of these electrolytes interferes in the
cell reaction. Silver nitrate, AgNO3(aq), would be a poor choice for the salt
bridge, however. Positive silver ions would migrate into the half-cell that
contains the cathode. Zinc displaces both copper and silver from solution,
so both copper(I) ions and silver ions would be reduced at the cathode.
The copper produced would be contaminated with silver.
Chapter 11 Cells and Batteries» MHR 507
Galvanic Cell Notation
A convenient shorthand method exists for representing galvanic cells. The
shorthand representation of a Daniell cell is as follows.
Zn | Zn?* || Cu2* | Cu
The phases or states may be included.
Zn5) | Zn" (aq) | Cu**(aq) | Cus)
As you saw in Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5, the anode may appear on the
left or on the right of a diagram. In the shorthand representation, however,
the anode is always shown on the left and the cathode on the right. Each
single vertical line, |, represents a phase boundary between the electrode
and the solution in a half-cell. For example, the first single vertical line
shows that the solid zinc and aqueous zinc ions are in different phases or
states. The double vertical line, ||, represents the porous barrier or salt
bridge between the half-cells. Spectator ions are usually omitted.
Inert Electrodes
The zinc anode and copper cathode of a Daniell cell are both metals, and
can act as electrical conductors. However, some redox reactions involve
substances that cannot act as electrodes, such as gases or dissolved
electrolytes. Galvanic cells that involve such redox reactions use inert
electrodes. An inert electrode is an electrode made from a material that
is neither a reactant nor a product of the cell reaction. Figure 11.6 shows
a cell that contains one inert electrode. The chemical equation, net ionic
equation, and half-reactions for this cell are given below.
Chemical equation: Phys) + 2FeCl3(aq) > 2FeCle(aq) + PbCla(ag)
Net ionic equation: Pby) + 2Fe?*(ag) > 2Fe?*(aq) + PbTM* (aq)
Oxidation half-reaction: Phys) > Pb**(aq) + 2e7
Reduction half-reaction: Fe**(aq) + e° > Fe*(aq)
The reduction half-reaction does not include a solid conductor of
electrons, so an inert platinum electrode is used in this half-cell. The
platinum electrode is chemically unchanged, so it does not appear in
the chemical equation or half-reactions. However, it is included in the
shorthand representation of the cell.
Pb | Pb?* || Fe*+, Fe2*+ | Pt
A comma separates the formulas Fe** and Fe?* for the ions involved in the
reduction half-reaction. The formulas are not separated by a vertical line,
because there is no phase boundary between these ions. The Fe** and Fe**
ions exist in the same aqueous solution.

Introducing Cell Potentials
You know that water spontaneously flows from a higher position to
a lower position. In other words, water flows from a state of higher
gravitational potential energy to a state of lower gravitational potential
energy. As water flows downhill, it can do work, such as turning a water
wheel or a turbine. The chemical changes that take place in galvanic
cells are also accompanied by changes in potential energy. Electrons
spontaneously flow from a position of higher potential energy at the
anode to a position of lower potential energy at the cathode. The moving
electrons can do work, such as lighting a bulb or turning a motor.

connecting two copper electrodes that have been inserted into the lemon.
The two copper electrodes are the same and are in contact with the same
electrolyte. There is no potential difference between the two electrodes.
Electric potentials vary from one cell to another, depending on various
factors. You will examine some of these factors in the next investigation.

Disposable Batteries
The Daniell cell is fairly large and full of liquid. Realistically, you could
not use this type of cell to power a wristwatch, a remote control, or a
flashlight. Galvanic cells have been modified, however, to make them
more useful.
The Dry Cell Battery
A dry cell is a galvanic cell with the electrolyte contained in a paste
thickened with starch. This cell is much more portable than the Daniell
cell. The first dry cell, invented by the French chemist Georges Leclanché
in 1866, was called the Leclanché cell.
Modern dry cells are closely modelled on the Leclanché cell, and also
contain electrolyte pastes. You have probably used dry cells in all kinds of
applications, such as lighting a flashlight, powering a remote control, or
ringing a doorbell. Dry cells are inexpensive. The cheapest AAA-, AA-, C-,
and D-size 1.5-V batteries are dry cells.
A battery is defined as a set of galvanic cells connected in series. The
negative electrode of one cell is connected to the positive electrode of the
next cell in the set. The voltage of a set of cells connected in series is the
sum of the voltages of the individual cells. Thus, a 9-V battery contains
six 1.5-V dry cells connected in series. Often, the term “battery” is also
used to describe a single cell. For example, a 1.5-V dry cell battery

The Button Cell Battery
A button battery is much smaller than an alkaline battery. Button batteries
are commonly used in watches, as shown in Figure 11.9. Because of its
small size, the button battery is also used for hearing aids, pacemakers, and
some calculators and cameras. The development of smaller batteries has
had an enormous impact on portable devices, as shown in Figure 11.10.
Two common types of button batteries both use a zinc container,
which acts as the anode, and an inert stainless steel cathode, as shown in
Figure 11.11 on the next page. In the mercury button battery, the alkaline
electrolyte paste contains mercury(I) oxide, HgO. In the silver button
battery, the electrolyte paste contains silver oxide, Ag,O. The batteries
have similar voltages: about 1.3 V for the mercury cell, and about 1.6 V
for the silver cell.

Table 11.1 and the larger table in Appendix E are based on the following
conventions.
e Each half-reaction is written as a reduction. The half-cell potential
for a reduction half-reaction is called a reduction potential. Look at
the molecules and ions on the left side of each half-reaction. The most
easily reduced molecules and ions (best oxidizing agents), such as F2,
MnO,_, and Oz, are near the top of the list. The least easily reduced
molecules and ions (worst oxidizing agents), such as Na‘, Ca?*, and
HO, are near the bottom of the list.
e The numerical values of cell potentials and half-cell potentials depend
on various conditions, so tables of standard reduction potentials are true
when ions and molecules are in their standard states. These standard
states are the same as for tables of standard enthalpy changes. Aqueous
molecules and ions have a standard concentration of 1 mol/L. Gases have
a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa or 1 atm. The standard temperature
is 25°C or 298 K. Standard reduction potentials are designated by the
symbol E°, where the superscript ° indicates standard states.
e Because you can measure potential differences, but not individual
reduction potentials, all values in the table are relative. Each half-cell
reduction potential is given relative to the reduction potential of the
standard hydrogen electrode, which has been assigned a value of zero.
The design of this electrode is shown in Figure 11.12.

For a Daniell cell, you know that copper is the cathode and zinc is the
anode. The relevant half-reactions and standard reduction potentials from
Table 11.1 are as follows.
Cu (aq) +2e =Cug) E = 0.342 V
Zn(‘aq) + 20° = Zny) E* =-0.762 V
Use these values to calculate the cell potential.
E’cell = E’cathode — E”anode
= 0.342 V - (-0.762 V)
= 0.342 V + 0.762 V
= 1.104 V
Thus, the standard cell potential for a Daniell cell is 1.104 V.
The standard cell potentials of all galvanic cells have positive values,
as explained in Figure 11.13, on the following page. Figure 11.13 shows
a “potential ladder” diagram. A “potential ladder” diagram models the
potential difference. The rungs on the ladder correspond to the values
of the reduction potentials.

This calculation of the standard cell potential for the Daniell cell used
the mathematical concept that the subtraction of a negative number is
equivalent to the addition of its positive value. You saw that
0.342 V — (-0.762 V) = 0.342 V + 0.762 V
In other words, the subtraction of the reduction potential for a
half-reaction is equivalent to the addition of the potential for the reverse
half-reaction. The reverse half-reaction of a reduction is an oxidation.
The half-cell potential for an oxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation
potential. If the reduction half-reaction is as follows,
Zn" (aq) +2e = Zng) E° =-0.762 V
then the oxidation half-reaction is
Zis) = Zn**(aq) + 26° E’ox = +0.762 V
To summarize, the standard cell potential can also be calculated as the
sum of a standard reduction potential and a standard oxidation potential.
Method 2: FE cell = 15 eel + Fox
As shown above, you can obtain the standard oxidation potential from
a table of standard reduction potentials by reversing the reduction half-
reaction, and changing the sign of the relevant potential. The reduction
and oxidation half-reactions for the previous example are as follows.
Cu**(aq) + 20° = Cur) E'ted = 0.342 V
Znis) = Zn**(aq) + 2e7 Egy = +0.762 V
The calculation of the standard cell potential using these standard
half-reaction potentials is as follows.
E’cell = E’rea + E“ox
= 0.342 V + 0.762 V
= 1.104 V
Finding the difference between two reduction potentials, and finding
the sum of a reduction potential and an oxidation potential are exactly
equivalent methods for finding a cell potential. Use whichever method
you prefer. The first Sample Problem includes both methods for finding
cell potentials. The second Sample Problem uses only the subtraction of
two reduction potentials. Practice problems are included after the second

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that you can calculate cell potentials by
using tables of half-cell potentials. The half-cell potential for a reduction
half-reaction is called a reduction potential. The half-cell potential for an
oxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation potential. Standard half-cell
potentials are written as reduction potentials. The values of standard
reduction potentials for half-reactions are relative to the reduction potential
of the standard hydrogen electrode. You used standard reduction potentials
to calculate standard cell potentials for galvanic cells. You learned two
methods of calculating standard cell potentials. One method is to subtract
the standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reduction
potential of the cathode. The other method is to add the standard reduction
potential of the cathode and the standard oxidation potential of the anode.
In the next section, you will learn about a different type of cell, called an
electrolytic cell.

Electrolysis of Water
The electrolysis of aqueous solutions may not yield the desired products.
Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) discovered the elements sodium and
potassium by electrolyzing their molten salts. Before this discovery, Davy
had electrolyzed aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium salts. He
had not succeeded in reducing the metal ions to the pure metals at the
cathode. Instead, his first experiments had produced hydrogen gas. Where
did the hydrogen gas come from?
When electrolyzing an aqueous solution, there are two compounds
present: water, and the dissolved electrolyte. Water may be electrolyzed
as well as, or instead of, the electrolyte. The electrolysis of water produces
oxygen gas and hydrogen gas, as shown in Figure 11.16.
GETTEETETS The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen gas
at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. Explain why the volume
of hydrogen gas is twice the volume of oxygen gas.

2H20) + 2e° = Hag) + 20H (aq) EE" = —0.828 V
You can use these values to calculate the E%.1; value for the
decomposition of water.

= —0.828 V — 1.229 V
= -2.057 V
Therefore,
2H20(e) > 2 Ho(g) + Ox) FE’cel]l = —2.057 V
The negative cell potential shows that the reaction is not spontaneous.
Electrolytic cells are used for non-spontaneous redox reactions, so all
electrolytic cells have negative cell potentials.
The standard reduction potentials used to calculate FE". for the
decomposition of water apply only to reactants and products in their
standard states. However, in pure water at 25°C, the hydrogen ions and
hydroxide ions each have concentrations of 1 x 10-’ mol/L. This is not
the standard state value of 1 mol/L. The reduction potential values for
the non-standard conditions in pure water are given below. The super-
script zero is now omitted from the E symbol, because the values are no
longer standard.
Oo) + 4H*(aq) + 46° = 2H20 EF = 0.815 V
2H,0(¢) + 260° > Hag) + 20H (aq) E =—0.414 V
Using these new half-cell potentials, E',.1 for the decomposition of
pure water at 25°C by electrolysis has a calculated value of —-1.229 V.
Therefore, the calculated value of the external voltage needed is 1.229.
In practice, the external voltage needed for an electrolytic cell is
always greater than the calculated value, especially for reactions involving
gases. Therefore, the actual voltage needed to electrolyze pure water is
greater than 1.229 V. The excess voltage required above the calculated
value is called the overvoltage. Overvoltages depend on the gases
involved and on the materials in the electrodes.
When electrolyzing water, there is another practical difficulty to
consider. Pure water is a very poor electrical conductor. To increase the
conductivity, an electrolyte that does not interfere in the reaction is added
to the water.

Electrolysis of Aqueous Solutions
As stated previously, an electrolytic cell may have the same design as a
galvanic cell, except for the external source of electricity. Consider, for
example, the familiar Daniell cell. (This cell was described in section 11.1
and shown in Figure 11.5.) By adding an external electrical supply, with a
voltage greater than the voltage of the Daniell cell, you can push electrons
in the opposite direction. By pushing electrons in the opposite direction,
you reverse the chemical reaction. Figure 11.17 shows both cells, while
their properties are compared in Table 11.2.

In the galvanic cell, the zinc anode gradually dissolves. The copper
cathode grows as more copper is deposited onto it. In the electrolytic cell,
the copper anode gradually dissolves. The zinc cathode grows as more
zinc is deposited onto it. The process in which a metal is deposited, or
plated, onto the cathode in an electrolytic cell is known as electroplating.
Electroplating is very important in industry, as you will learn later in
this chapter.

Predicting the Products of Electrolysis for an Aqueous Solution
The comparison of the Daniell cell with the electrolytic version of the cell
appears straightforward. One reaction is the reverse of the other. However,
you have just learned that the electrolysis of an aqueous solution may
involve the electrolysis of water. How can you predict the actual products
for this type of electrolysis reaction?
To predict the products of an electrolysis involving an aqueous
solution, you must examine all possible half-reactions and their reduction
potentials. Then, you must find the overall reaction that requires the
lowest external voltage. That is, you must find the overall cell reaction
with a negative cell potential that is closest to zero. The next Sample
Problem shows you how to predict the products of the electrolysis of
an aqueous solution.
In practice, reaction products are sometimes different from the
products predicted, using the method described here. Predictions are least
reliable when the reduction potentials are close together, especially when
gaseous products are expected. However, there are many cases in which
the predictions are correct.

Spontaneity of Reactions
You know that galvanic cells have positive standard cell potentials, and
that these cells use spontaneous chemical reactions to produce electricity.
You also know that electrolytic cells have negative standard cell potentials,
and that these cells use electricity to perform non-spontaneous chemical
reactions. Thus, you can use the sign of the standard cell potential to pre-
dict whether a reaction is spontaneous or not under standard conditions.

standard conditions.

(a) The two half-reactions are as follows.

The relevant standard reduction potentials are:

The standard cell potential is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous
under standard conditions.

The standard cell potential is negative, so the reaction is
non-spontaneous under standard conditions.

Rechargeable Batteries
In section 11.1, you learned about several primary (disposable) F 1
batteries that contain galvanic cells. One of the most common secondary
(rechargeable) batteries is found in car engines. Most cars contain a
lead-acid battery, shown in Figure 11.18. When you turn the ignition,
a surge of electricity from the battery starts the motor.
When in use, a lead-acid battery partially discharges. In other words,
the cells in the battery operate as galvanic cells, and produce electricity.
The reaction in each cell proceeds spontaneously in one direction. To
recharge the battery, a generator driven by the car engine supplies
electricity to the battery. The external voltage of the generator reverses
the reaction in the cells. The reaction in each cell now proceeds non- Atypical car

As the name suggests, the materials used in a lead-acid battery
include lead and an acid. Figure 11.19 shows that the electrodes in each
cell are constructed using lead grids. One electrode consists of powdered
lead packed into one grid. The other electrode consists of powdered
lead(IV) oxide packed into the other grid. The electrolyte solution is
fairly concentrated sulfuric acid, at about 4.5 mol/L.

some of the lead(IV) oxide in the cathode, and some of the sulfuric acid.
A precipitate of lead(ID) sulfate forms.
When the battery is recharged, the half-reactions and the overall cell
reaction are reversed. In this reverse reaction, lead and lead(IV) oxide are
redeposited in their original locations, and sulfuric acid is re-formed.

In practice, this reversibility is not perfect. However, the battery can go
through many charge/discharge cycles before it eventually wears out.
Many types of rechargeable batteries are much more portable than a car
battery. For example, there is now a rechargeable version of the alkaline
battery. Another example, shown in Figure 11.20, is the rechargeable
nickel-cadmium (nicad) battery. Figure 11.21 shows a nickel-cadmium cell,
Oo vent ball
which has a potential of about 1.4 V. A typical nicad battery contains three
cells in series to produce a suitable voltage for electronic devices. When
the cells in a nicad battery operate as galvanic cells, the half-reactions and
the overall cell reaction are as follows.

terms: quantity of electricity,
electric charge, Faraday’s
You know that a balanced equation represents relationships between
law, extraction, refining
the quantities of reactants and products. For a reaction that takes place
in a cell, stoichiometric calculations can also include the quantity of
electricity produced or consumed. Stoichiometric calculations in electro-
chemistry make use of a familiar unit—the mole.
As a first step, you need information about measurements in
electricity. You know that the flow of electrons through an external circuit
is called the electric current. It is measured in a unit called the ampere
(symbol A), named after the French physicist André Ampére (1775-1836).
The quantity of electricity, also known as the electric charge, is the
product of the current flowing through a circuit and the time for which it
flows. The quantity of electricity is measured in a unit called the coulomb
(symbol C). This unit is named after another French physicist, Charles
Coulomb (1736-1806). The ampere and the coulomb are related, in that
one coulomb is the quantity of electricity that flows through a circuit in
one second if the current is one ampere. This relationship can be written
mathematically.
charge (in coulombs) = current (in amperes) x time (in seconds)
For example, suppose a current of 2.00 A flows for 5.00 min. You can use
this information to find the quantity of electricity, in coulombs.
5.00 min = 300s
2.00 A x 300 s = 600 C, or 6.00 x 10? C
538 =MHR« Unit 5 Electrochemistry
For stoichiometric calculations, you also need to know the electric charge
on a mole of electrons. This charge can be calculated by multiplying
the charge on one electron and the number of electrons in one mole
(Avogadro’s number). The charge on a mole of electrons is known as
one faraday (1 F), named after Michael Faraday.

Charge on one mole of electrons =
Le" 1 mol
= 9.647 x 10* C/mol
A rounded value of 96 500 C/mol is often used in calculations. Note that
this rounded value has three significant digits.
The information you have just learned permits a very precise
control of electrolysis. For example, suppose you modify a Daniell cell
to operate as an electrolytic cell. You want to plate 0.1 mol of zinc onto
the zinc electrode. The coefficients in the half-reaction for the reduction
represent stoichiometric relationships. Figure 11.23 shows that two
moles of electrons are needed for each mole of zinc deposited. Therefore,
to deposit 0.1 mol of zinc, you need to use 0.2 mol of electrons.

(GPT) A balanced half-reaction shows relationships between the amounts of
reactants and products and the amount of electrons transferred.
In the next Sample Problem, you will learn to apply the relationship
between the amount of electrons and the amount of an electrolysis product.

Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Use the current and the time to find the quantity of electricity
used.
Step 2 From the quantity of electricity, find the amount of electrons
that passed through the circuit.
Step 3 Use the stoichiometry of the relevant half-reaction to relate
the amount of electrons to the amount of aluminum produced.
Step 4 Use the molar mass of aluminum to convert the amount of
aluminum to a mass.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 To calculate the quantity of electricity in coulombs, work in
amperes and seconds.

Step 2 Find the amount of electrons. One mole of electrons has a charge
of 96 500 C. be

Step 4 Convert the amount of aluminum to a mass.

Check Your Solution
The answer is expressed in units of mass. To check your answer, use
estimation. If the current were 1 A, then 1 mol of electrons would pass
in 96 500 s. In this example, the current is less than 1 A, and the time is
much less than 96 500 s. Therefore, much less than 1 mol of electrons
would be used, and much less than 1 mol (27 g) of aluminum would
be formed.

\ y,
The preceding Sample Problem gave an example of the mathematical use
of Faraday’s law. Faraday’s law states that the amount of a substance
produced or consumed in an electrolysis reaction is directly proportional
to the quantity of electricity that flows through the circuit.
To illustrate this statement, think about changing the quantity of
electricity used in the Sample Problem. Suppose this quantity were
doubled by using the same current, 500 mA, for twice the time, 3 h.
As a result, the amount of electrons passing into the cell would also be
doubled.
500 mA = 0.500 A
3h=2x1.5h
=2 x 5400 s
Quantity of electricity = 0.500 A x (2 x 5400 s)

Amount of electrons = 5400-6x

Then, as you can see from the relevant half-reaction, the mass of
aluminum produced would be doubled. The mass of aluminum produced
is clearly proportional to the quantity of electricity used.
In Investigation 11-C, you will apply Faraday’s law to an electrolytic
cell that you construct.

Industrial Extraction and Refining of Metals
Many metals, and their alloys, are widely used in modern society. The
enormous variety of metal objects ranges from large vehicles, such as cars
and aircraft, to small items, such as the pop cans shown in Figure 11.24.
Extraction is a process by which a metal is obtained from an ore.
Some metals are extracted in electrolytic cells. In section 11.3, you saw
the extraction of sodium from molten sodium chloride in a Downs cell.
Other reactive metals, including lithium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium,
and radium, are also extracted industrially by the electrolysis of their
molten chlorides.
One of the most important electrolytic processes is the extraction
of aluminum from an ore called bauxite. This ore is mainly composed
of hydrated aluminum oxide, Al,O3 + xH,O. (The “x” in the formula

magnesium, manganese, iron,
silicon, and copper. Therefore, the industrial extraction of aluminum and other metals by
electrolysis requires vast quantities of electricity. The availability and
cost of electricity greatly influence the location of industrial plants.
In industry, the process of purifying a material is known as refining.
After the extraction stage, some metals are refined in electrolytic cells.
For example, copper is about 99% pure after extraction. This copper
is pure enough for some uses, such as the manufacture of copper pipes
for plumbing. However, the copper is not pure enough for one of its
principal uses, electrical wiring. Therefore, some of the impure copper is
refined electrolytically, as shown in Figure 11.25. Nickel can be refined
electrolytically in a similar way. You refined copper on a small scale in
Investigation 11-C.
GPTIEEE2E3 This electrolytic cell is used to refine copper. The anode is impure copper,
and the cathode is pure copper. During electrolysis, the impure copper anode dissolves, and
pure copper is plated onto the cathode. The resulting cathode is 99.99% pure metal. Most
impurities that were present in the anode either remain in solution or fall to the bottom of
the cell as a sludge.

Many metals are fairly easily oxidized. The atmosphere contains a

powerful oxidizing agent: oxygen. Because metals are constantly in
contact with oxygen, they are vulnerable to corrosion. In fact, the term
“corrosion” is sometimes defined as the oxidation of metals exposed
to the environment. In North America, about 20% to 25% of iron and
steel production is used to replace objects that have been damaged or
destroyed by corrosion. However, not all corrosion is harmful. For
example, the green layer formed by the corrosion of a copper roof is
considered attractive by many people.

Rust is a hydrated iron(II) oxide, Fe203 ¢ xH2O. The electrochemical
formation of rust occurs in small galvanic cells on the surface of a piece
of iron, as shown in Figure 11.28. In each small cell, iron acts as the
anode. The cathode is inert, and may be an impurity that exists in the iron
or is deposited onto it. For example, the cathode could be a piece of soot
that has been deposited onto the iron surface from the air.
Water, in the form of rain, is needed for rusting to occur. Carbon
dioxide in the air dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, H2CO (aq) «
This weak acid partially dissociates into ions. Thus, the carbonic acid is
an electrolyte for the corrosion process. Other electrolytes, such as road
salt, may also be involved. The circuit is completed by the iron itself,
which conducts electrons from the anode to the cathode.

The rusting of iron involves the reaction of iron, oxygen, and water ina
naturally occurring galvanic cell on the exposed surface of the metal. There may be many
of these small cells on the surface of the same piece of iron.
The rusting process is complex, and the equations may be written in
various ways. A simplified description of the half-reactions and the
overall cell reaction is given here.
Oxidation half-reaction (occurs at the anode):
Fe(s) > Fe?a*g) + 2€7
Reduction half-reaction (occurs at the cathode):
Oa(g) + 2H20() + 4€° > 40H (aq)
Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by two and add the half-reactions
to obtain the overall cell reaction.
2Fe(s) + Ox) + 2H20(e) > 2Fe*(a*q) + 40H (aq)
There is no barrier in the cell, so nothing stops the dissolved Fe** and
OH’ ions from mixing. The iron(II) ions produced at the anode and the
hydroxide ions produced at the cathode react to form a precipitate of
iron(I) hydroxide, Fe(OH). Therefore, the overall cell reaction could
be written as follows.
2Fe(s) + Oa) + 2H20(2) = 2Fe(OH)a(5)
The iron(II) hydroxide undergoes further oxidation by reaction with the
oxygen in the air to form iron(II) hydroxide.
4Fe(OH)a(5) + O2(¢) + 2H20 (0) > 4Fe(OH)s(s)
Chapter 11 Cells and Batteries > MHR 547
Iron(IIJ) hydroxide readily breaks down to form hydrated iron(II oxide,
Fe,O3 ¢ xH,0, more commonly known as rust. As noted earlier, the “x
signifies a variable number of water molecules per formula unit.
2Fe(OH)s(s) > Fe2O3 ¢ 3H2405)
Both Fe(OH); and Fe,O3 + xH,O are reddish-brown, or “rust coloured.”
A rust deposit may contain a mixture of these compounds.
Fortunately, not all metals corrode to the same extent as iron. Many
metals do corrode in air to form a surface coating of metal oxide.
However, in many cases, the oxide layer adheres, or sticks firmly, to the
metal surface. This layer protects the metal from further corrosion. For
example, aluminum, chromium, and magnesium are readily oxidized in
air to form their oxides, Al,O3, Cr203, and MgO. Unless the oxide layer is
broken by a cut or a scratch, the layer prevents further corrosion. In con-
trast, rust easily flakes off from the surface of an iron object and provides
little protection against further corrosion.
Corrosion Prevention
Corrosion, and especially the corrosion of iron, can be very destructive.
For this reason, a great deal of effort goes into corrosion prevention. The
simplest method of preventing corrosion is to paint an iron object. The
protective coating of paint prevents air and water from reaching the metal
surface. Other effective protective layers include grease, oil, plastic, or a
metal that is more resistant to corrosion than iron. For example, a layer
of chromium protects bumpers and metal trim on cars. An enamel coating
is often used to protect metal plates, pots, and pans. Enamel is a shiny,
hard, and very unreactive type of glass that can be melted onto a metal
surface. A protective layer is effective as long as it completely covers the
iron object. If a hole or scratch breaks the layer, the metal underneath
can corrode.
It is also possible to protect iron against corrosion by forming an alloy
with a different metal. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron that contains at
least 10% chromium, by mass, in addition to small quantities of carbon
and occasionally metals such as nickel. Stainless steel is much more
resistant to corrosion than pure iron. Therefore, stainless steel is often
used for cutlery, taps, and various other applications where rust-resistance
is important. However, chromium is much more expensive than iron. As
a result, stainless steel is too expensive for use in large-scale applications,
such as building bridges.
Galvanizing is a process in which iron is covered with a protective
layer of zinc. Galvanized iron is often used to make metal buckets and
chain-link fences. Galvanizing protects iron in two ways. First, the zinc
acts as a protective layer. If this layer is broken, the iron is exposed to
air and water. When this happens, however, the iron is still protected.
Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron. Therefore, zinc, not iron, becomes
the anode in the galvanic cell. The zinc metal is oxidized to zinc ions. In
this situation, zinc is known as a sacrificial anode, because it is destroyed
(sacrificed) to protect the iron. Iron acts as the cathode when zinc is pres-
ent. Thus, iron does not undergo oxidation until all the zinc has reacted.
548 MHR-« Unit 5 Electrochemistry
Cathodic protection is another method of preventing rusting, as
shown in Figure 11.29. As in galvanizing, a more reactive metal is
attached to the iron object. This reactive metal acts as a sacrificial anode,
and the iron becomes the cathode of a galvanic cell. Unlike galvanizing,
the metal used in cathodic protection does not completely cover the iron.
Because the sacrificial anode is slowly destroyed by oxidation, it must be
replaced periodically.
If iron is covered with a protective layer of a metal that is less reactive
than iron, there can be unfortunate results. A “tin” can is actually a steel
can coated with a thin layer of tin. While the tin layer remains intact, it
provides effective protection against rusting. If the tin layer is broken or
scratched, however, the iron in the steel corrodes faster in contact with
the tin than the iron would on its own. Since tin is less reactive than
iron, tin acts as a cathode in each galvanic cell on the surface of the can.
Therefore, the tin provides a large area of available cathodes for the small

Automobile Engines
The internal combustion engine found in most automobiles uses
gasoline as a fuel. Unfortunately, this type of engine produces pollutants,
such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants contribute to health and
environmental problems, such as smog and the greenhouse effect. In
addition, the internal combustion engine is very inefficient. It converts
only about 25% of the chemical energy of the fuel into the kinetic
energy of the car. Electric cars, such as those shown in Figure 11.30,
may provide a more efficient and less harmful alternative.
GPTIEEEES) Many electric cars
are currently under development.
In fact, the idea of electric cars is
not new. In the early days of the
automobile, electric cars were more
common than gasoline-powered
cars. The production of electric cars
peaked in 1912, but then completely
stopped in the 1930s.
Manufacturers and researchers have attempted to power
electric cars with rechargeable batteries, such as modified lead-acid
and nickel-cadmium batteries. However, rechargeable batteries run
down fairly quickly. The distance driven before recharging a battery
may be 250 km or less. The battery must then be recharged from an
external electrical source. Recharging the lead-acid battery of an electric
car takes several hours. Cars based on a version of the nickel-cadmium
battery can be recharged in only fifteen minutes. However, recharging
the batteries of an electric car is still inconvenient.
A new type of power supply for electric cars eliminates the need for
recharging. A fuel cell is a battery that produces electricity while reactants
are supplied continuously from an external source. Because reactants
continuously flow into the cell, a fuel cell is also known as a flow battery.
Unlike the fuel supply of a more conventional battery, the fuel supply in a
fuel cell is unlimited. As in the combustion of gasoline in a conventional
engine, the overall reaction in a fuel cell is the oxidation of a fuel by oxygen.
The space shuttle uses a fuel cell as a source of energy. This cell
depends on the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to form water. The
fuel cell operates under basic conditions, so it is sometimes referred to
as an alkaline fuel cell. Figure 11.31, on the next page, shows the design
of the cell. The half-reactions and the overall reaction are as follows.
Reduction (occurs at the cathode): Oz) + 2H20(e) + 4e7 > 40H (aq)
Oxidation (occurs at the anode): Hag) + 20H (aq) > 2H20e) + 2e7
Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 2, add the two half-reactions, and
simplify to obtain the overall cell reaction.
2Hog) + Ox) > 2H2Oi0e)
Notice that the overall equation is the same as the equation for the
combustion of hydrogen. The combustion of hydrogen is an exothermic
reaction. In the fuel cell, this reaction produces energy in the form of
electricity, rather than heat.

GETTEEEEES] In an alkaline fuel cell, the half-reactions do not include solid conductors of
electrons. Therefore, the cell has two inert electrodes.
The hydrogen fuel cell produces water vapour, which does not contribute
to smog formation or to the greenhouse effect. This product makes the
hydrogen fuel cell an attractive energy source for cars. Also, the hydrogen
fuel cell is much more efficient than the internal combustion engine. A
hydrogen fuel cell converts about 80% of the chemical energy of the fuel
into the kinetic energy of the car.
There is a possible problem with the hydrogen fuel cell. The cell
requires hydrogen fuel. Unfortunately, uncombined hydrogen is not found
naturally on Earth. Most hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbon fuels,
such as petroleum or methane. These manufacturing processes may
contribute significantly to pollution problems. However, hydrogen can
also be produced by the electrolysis of water. If a source such as solar
energy or hydroelectricity is used to power the electrolysis, the overall
quantity of pollution is low.
The following practice problems will allow you to test your
understanding of fuel cells.

Water Treatment and the Chlor-Alkali Process
In many countries, water is not safe to drink. Untreated water is
sometimes polluted with toxic chemicals. It may also carry numerous
water-borne diseases, including typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery.
In Canada, the water that comes through your tap has been through an
elaborate purification process. This process is designed to remove solid
particles and toxic chemicals, and to reduce the number of bacteria
to safe levels. Adding chlorine to water is the most common way to
destroy bacteria.
You have already seen that chlorine gas can be made by the
electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. In industry, some chlorine is
produced in this way using the Downs cell described earlier. However,
more chlorine is produced in Canada using a different method, called
the chlor-alkali process. In this process, brine is electrolyzed in a cell
like the one shown in Figure 11.32. Brine is a saturated solution of
sodium chloride.

The asbestos diaphragm stops the chlorine gas produced at the anode from mixing with the

The half-reactions and the overall cell reaction in the chlor-alkali process

reaction. However, it combines with OH to produce sodium hydroxide,
as shown by the balanced chemical equation below.
2NaCliaq) + 2H20(¢) > Clip) + Hog) + 2NaOH aq)
The products of the chlor-alkali process are all useful. Sodium hydroxide
is used to make soaps and detergents. It is widely used as a base in many
other industrial chemical reactions, as well. The hydrogen produced by
the chlor-alkali process is used as a fuel. Chlorine has many uses besides
water treatment. For example, chlorine is used as a bleach in the pulp and
paper industry. Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of chlorinated
organic compounds, such as the common plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
The chlorination of water is usually carried out by adding chlorine
gas, sodium hypochlorite, or calcium hypochlorite to the water in low
concentrations. The active antibacterial agent in each case is hypochlorous
acid, HClO,). For example, when chlorine gas is added to water,
hypochlorous acid is formed by the following reaction.
Clip) + H20 we) -> HCO (aq) + HCl(agq)
Some people object to the chlorination of water, and prefer to drink
bottled spring water. There is controversy over the level of risk associated
with chlorination, and over the possible benefits of spring water. For
example, hypochlorous acid reacts with traces of organic materials in
the water supply. These reactions can produce toxic substances, such as
chloroform. Supporters of chlorination believe that these substances are
present at very low, safe levels, but opponents of chlorination disagree.

Additional Topics
What other health-related challenges has chemistry helped scientists to
understand or solve? You may wish to go beyond the challenges listed in
Parts 1 to 5 of the Course Challenge and investigate other areas of human
health. Some suggestions are listed below.
Unit 1
e Researchers can use computer programs to test the geometry of many
molecular structures and determine their suitability for specific applica-
tions. For example, a specialized screen saver can check the shape of
hypothetical molecules based on their suitability for cancer treatment.
Anyone can upload the screen saver and use a computer’s idle time
to test molecules. Research this method, and write an article on the
success of computer-assisted research.
e Pyruvate carboxylase (also called PC) is an enzyme that converts
pyruvate to oxaloacetate (shown as oxaloacetic acid in the citric acid
cycle diagram). Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is a genetic disorder
that is characterized by insufficient quantities of pyruvate carboxylate in
the body. How do you think this disorder affects the citric acid cycle?
Use print and electronic resources to research pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency. Find out what its symptoms are, and how it affects the body
at the molecular level. Also find out what percent of the population is
affected, and how the deficiency can be relieved. Present your findings
as an informative pamphlet. If possible, conduct an e-mail interview
with an expert on the disorder.
572 MHR = Course Challenge
e Use print and electronic resources to study compounds that have been
produced as diet aids, such as aspartame and olestra. How do these
compounds work? Are there drawbacks or risks involved in using these
compounds? Choose one compound, and conduct a risk-benefit analysis.
Unit 2
e Watson and Crick’s discovery of the structure of DNA revolutionized
scientists’ understanding of heredity and genetics. Find out how Watson
and Crick showed that the structure of DNA is a double helix. How did
Rosalind Franklin’s work in X-ray crystallography play a role? Present
your findings as an annotated, illustrated time line.
e It is relatively straightforward to extract DNA from animal matter.
Research a procedure on the Internet. Obtain your teacher’s approval,
and then carry out the extraction. Use the concept of intermolecular
forces to explain how the extraction works.
Unit 3
e Human disorders and conditions are sometimes caused by the lack
of an enzyme. For example, lactose intolerance is caused by low
concentrations of lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose (the
sugar in milk). Find out about lactose intolerance or another condition
that is caused by a missing enzyme. How are the conditions diagnosed?
Have treatments been developed? How effective are the treatments?
Who suffers from the condition? How harmful is it?
e Researchers have used a specially designed calorimeter, called a human
calorimeter, to monitor the heat that is produced by metabolic reactions
in humans. Research the human calorimeters that are used to study
metabolic reactions. What are the design features of these calorimeters?
What factors do researchers need to take into account? Why are the
experiments with human calorimeters important? Design an investiga-
tion that incorporates the results of your research.
Unit 4
e In Part 4 of the Course Challenge, you looked at the carbonic acid/
hydrogen carbonate buffer system in the blood. Another important
buffer system in the body depends on the equilibrium between dihydro-
gen phosphate, H,PO,, and hydrogen phosphate, HPO,’~. Use print and
electronic resources to learn where this buffer system is found in the
body and how the body regulates concentrations of H,PO,” and H2PO,?-.
e Acid indigestion, also known as “heartburn,” is caused by the excess
production of stomach acid. Eating a large meal may bring on acid
indigestion. Commercial antacids contain basic salts that neutralize the
excess acids. Design a titration experiment to test the effectiveness of
various brands of antacids.
Unit 5
e Using only materials that are available in your school chemistry
laboratory, design a pacemaker battery. Find out what voltage is appro-
priate for a pacemaker. Be sure to outline all design considerations.
For example, how large will the battery need to be? How long will it
last? Have your teacher approve your design. Then build your battery.
e Using print and electronic resources, research the work of Wilson
Greatbatch, the inventor of the implantable pacemaker. What

CONCEPT CHECK
For logarithmic values, only the digits to the right of the
decimal point count as significant digits. The digit to the
left of the decimal point fixes the location of the decimal
point of the original value.

7. Hold the suction bulb loosely on the end of the
glass stem. Use the suction bulb to draw liquid
up just past the etched volume mark. (See Figure

back over the end of the stem. This will prevent
more solution from draining out.
11. Touch the tip of the pipette to the side of the beaker
to remove any clinging drop. See Figure F.3. The

Chemistry: A Blend of Science and Technology
Like all scientists, chemists try to describe and explain the world.
Chemists start by asking questions such as these:
e Why is natural gas such an effective fuel?
e How can we separate a mixture of crude oil and water?
e Which materials dissolve in water?
e What is rust and why does it form?
To answer these questions, chemists develop models, conduct
experiments, and seek patterns. They observe various types of chemical
reactions, and they perform calculations based on known data. They build
continuously on the work and the discoveries of other scientists.
Long before humans developed a scientific understanding of the
world, they invented chemical techniques and processes. These tech-
niques and processes included smelting and shaping metals, growing
crops, and making medicines. Early chemists invented technological
instruments, such as glassware and distillation equipment.
Present-day chemical technologists continue to invent new equipment.
They also invent new or better ways to provide products and services that
people want. Chemical technologists ask questions such as the following:
e How can we redesign this motor to run on natural gas?
e How can we contain and clean up an oil spill?
e What methods can we use, or develop, to make water safe to drink?
e How can we prevent iron objects from rusting?
D Green plants use a chemical process, called photo-
synthesis, to convert water and carbon dioxide into
the food substances they need to survive. All the
foods that you eat depend on this process.
E Your body uses chemical processes to break down
food and to release energy.
F Your home is full of products that are manufactured
by chemical industries. The products that are shown
here are often used for cleaning. Some of these
products, such as bleach and drain cleaner, can be
dangerous if handled improperly.
Chapter 1 Observing Matter * MHR 7
Chemistry, Technology, Society, and the Environment
Today we benefit in many ways from chemical understanding and tech-
nologies. Each benefit, however, has risks associated with it. The risks and
benefits of chemical processes and technologies affect us either directly or
indirectly. Many people—either on their own, in groups, or through their
elected government officials—assess these risks and benefits. They ask
questions such as the following:
e Is it dangerous to use natural gas to heat my home?
e Why is the cost of gasoline so high?
e Is my water really clean enough to drink and use safely?
¢ How does rust degrade machinery over time?
During your chemistry course this year, you will study the interactions
among science, technology, society, and the environment. These interac-
tions are abbreviated as STSE. Throughout the textbook—in examples,
practice problems, activities, investigations, and features—STSE interac-
tions are discussed. The issues that appear at the end of some units are
especially rich sources for considering STSE interactions. In these simula-
tions, you are encouraged to assess and make decisions about important
issues that affect society and the environment.
STSE Issue: Are Phosphates Helpful or Harmful?
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for life on Earth. Plants need
phosphorus, along with other nutrients, in order to grow. Phosphorus is
a component of bones and teeth. In addition, phosphorus is excreted as
waste from the body. Thus, it is present in human sewage.
Since phosphorus promotes plant growth, phosphates are excellent
fertilizers for crops. (Phosphates are chemicals containing phosphorus.
You will learn more about phosphates later in this unit.) Phosphates are
also used as food additives, and as components in some medicines. In
addition, they are an important part of dishwasher and laundry deter-
gents. For example, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) acts to soften water,
and keep dirt suspended in the water. Before the 1970s, STPP was a major
ingredient in most detergents.
Phosphates Causing Trouble
In the 1960s, residents around Lake Erie began to notice problems. Thick
growths of algae carpeted the surface of the water. Large amounts of the
algae washed onto beaches, making the beaches unfit for swimming. The
water in the lake looked green, and had an unpleasant odour. As time
passed, certain fish species in Lake Erie began to decrease.
In 1969, a joint Canadian and American task force pinpointed the
Language LINK source of the problem. Phosphates and other nutrients were entering the
lake, causing algae to grow rapidly. The algae then began to die and rot,

tive. Also, it would be expensive to develop other chemicals to do the
same job. After pressure from the government, detergent companies
reduced the amount of phosphate in their products by about 90%. Cities
on Lake Erie spent millions of dollars adding phosphorus removal to their
waste treatment. Today, Lake Erie has almost completely recovered.

These properties can all be observed without changing iron into some-
thing new.
A chemical property is a property that you can observe when one
kind of matter is converted into a different kind of matter. For example, a
chemical property of iron is that it reacts with oxygen to form a different
kind of matter: rust. Rust and iron have completely different physical and
chemical properties.
Figure 1.3 shows another example of a chemical property. Glucose
test paper changes colour in the presence of glucose. Thus, a chemical
property of glucose test paper is that it changes colour in response to
glucose. Similarly, a chemical property of glucose is that it changes the
colour of glucose test paper.
Recall that some properties of matter, such as colour, and flammabili-
ty, are qualitative. You can describe them in words, but you cannot
measure them or express them numerically. Other properties, such as
density and boiling point, can be measured and expressed numerically.
Such properties are quantitative. In Investigation 1-A you will use both
qualitative and quantitative properties to examine a familiar item.

Using Measurements to Describe Matter
In the investigation, you measured the size and mass of a piece of alu-
minum foil. You have probably performed these types of measurement
many times before. Measurements are so much a part of your daily life
that you can easily take them for granted. The clothes you wear come in
different sizes. Much of the food you eat is sold by the gram, kilogram,
millilitre, or litre. When you follow a recipe, you measure amounts. The
dimensions of paper and coins are made to exact specifications. The value
of money is itself a measurement.
Measurements such as clothing size, amounts of food, and currency
are not standard, however. Clothing sizes in Europe are different from
those in North America. European chefs tend to measure liquids and
powdered solids by mass, rather than by volume. Currencies, of course,
differ widely from country to country.
To communicate effectively, scientists rely on a standard system of
measurement. As you have learned in previous studies, this system is
called the International System of Units (Le systéme international
d’unités, SJ). It allows scientists anywhere in the world to describe
matter in the same quantitative language. There are seven base SI units,
and many more units that are derived from them. The metre (m), the
kilogram (kg), and the second (s) are three of the base SI units. You will
learn about two more base units, the mole (mol) and the kelvin (K), later
in this book.
When you describe matter, you use terms such as mass, volume, and
temperature. When you measure matter, you use units such as grams,
cubic centimetres, and degrees Celsius. Table 1.3 lists some quantities and
units that you will use often in this course. You are familiar with all of
them except, perhaps, for the mole and the kelvin. The mole is one of the
most important units for describing amounts of matter. You will be intro-
duced to the mole in Unit 2. The kelvin is used to measure temperature.
You will learn more about the kelvin scale in Unit 5. Consult Appendix E
if you would like to review other SI quantities and units.

the number of millilitres in 1 L, or the number of seconds in 1 min?
Numbers such as these—numbers that you can count or numbers that are
true by definition—are called exact numbers. You are certain that there
are five Great Lakes (or nine books on the shelf, or ten students in the
classroom) because you can count them. Likewise, you are certain that
there are 1000 mL in 1 L, and 60 s in 1 min. These relationships are true
by definition.
Now consider the numbers you used and the calculations you did in

Chapter 1 Observing Matter» MHR 15
During the investigations in this textbook, you will use equipment
such as rulers, balances, graduated cylinders, and thermometers to
measure matter. You will calculate values with a calculator or with
specially programmed software. How exact can your measurements and
calculations be? How exact should they be?
Two main factors affect your ability to record and communicate meas-
urements and calculations. One factor is the instruments you use. The
other factor is your ability to read and interpret what the instruments tell
you. Examine Figures 1.5 and 1.6. They will help you understand which
digits you can know with certainty, and which digits are uncertain.
What is the length measured by ruler A? Is it 4.2 cm, or is it 4.3 cm? You
cannot be certain. The 2 of 4.2 is an estimate. The 3 of 4.3 is also an
estimate. In both cases, therefore, you are uncertain about the last

16 MHR-* Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
Significant Digits, Certainty, and Measurements
All measurements involve uncertainty. One source of this uncertainty
is the measuring device itself. Another source is your ability to perceive
and interpret a reading. In fact, you cannot measure anything with
complete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement is
always an estimate.
The digits that you record when you measure something are called
significant digits. Significant digits include the digits that you are certain
about and a final, uncertain digit that you estimate. For example, 4.28 g
has three significant digits. The first two digits, the 4 and the 2, are
certain. The last digit, the 8, is an estimate. Therefore, it is uncertain.
The value 4.3 has two significant digits. The 4 is certain, and the 3 is
uncertain.
How Can You Tell Which Digits Are Significant?
You can identify the number of significant digits in any value. Table 1.4
lists some rules to help you do this.
Table 1.4 Rules for Determining Significant Digits

be significant. See the box below to find out why.
Explaining Three Significant Digits
The Great Lakes contain 22 700 km? of water. Is there exactly that amount
of water in the Great Lakes? No, 22 700 km? is an approximate value. The
actual volume could be anywhere from 22 651 km® to 22 749 km%. You can
use scientific notation to rewrite 22 700 km? as 2.27 x 104 km. This shows
that only three digits are significant. (Gee Appendix E at the back of the
book, if you would like to review scientific notation.)
Explaining Five Significant Digits
What if you were able to measure the volume of water in the Great Lakes?
You could verify the value of 22 700 km®. Then all five digits (including the
zeros) would be significant. Here again, scientific notation lets you show
clearly the five significant digits: 2.2700 x 104 km?.
Chapter 1 Observing Matter » MHR 17
Practice Problems
1. Write the following quantities in your notebook. Beside each
quantity, record the number of significant digits.
(a) 24.7 kg (e) 8.930 x 10° km
(b) 247.7 mL (f) 2.5 8
(c) 247.701 mg (g) 0.0003 mL
(d) 0.247 01 L (h) 923.2 g
2. Consider the quantity 2400 g.
(a) Assume that you measured this quantity. How many significant
digits does it have?
(b) Now assume that you have no knowledge of how it was obtained.
How many significant digits does it have?
Accuracy and Precision
In everyday speech, you might use the terms “accuracy” and “precision”
to mean the same thing. In science, however, these terms are related to
certainty. Each, then, has a specific meaning.
Accuracy refers to how close a given quantity is to an accepted or
expected value. (See Figure 1.7.) Precision may refer to the exactness of a
measurement. For example, ruler B in Figure 1.5 lets you measure length
with greater precision than ruler A. Precision may also refer to the close-
ness of a series of data points. Data that are very close to one another are
said to be precise. Examine Figure 1.8. Notice that a set of data can be
precise but not accurate.
Under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, 5 mL of water has a
mass of 5 g. Why does the reading on this balance showa different value?

Calculating with Significant Digits
In this course, you will often take measurements and use them to calcu-
late other quantities. You must be careful to keep track of which digits
in your calculations and results are significant. Why? Your results
should not imply more certainty than your measured quantities justify.
This is especially important when you use a calculator. Calculators
usually report results with far more figures—greater certainty —than
your data warrant. Always remember that calculators do not make
decisions about certainty. You do.
There are three rules for reporting significant digits in calculated
answers. These rules are summarized in Table 1.5. Reflect on how they
apply to your previous experiences. Then examine the Sample
Problems that follow.
Table 1.5 Rules for Reporting Significant Digits in Calculations
Rule 1: Multiplying and Dividing
The value with the fewest number of significant digits, going into the
calculation, determines the number of significant digits that you should
report in your answer.
Rule 2: Adding and Subtracting
The value with the fewest number of decimal places, going into the
calculation, determines the number of decimal places that you should
report in your answer.
Rule 3: Rounding
To get the appropriate number of significant digits (rule 1) or decimal
places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer.
If your answer ends in a number that is greater than 5, increase the
preceding digit by 1. For example, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35.
If your answer ends with a number that is less than 5, leave the preceding
number unchanged. For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7.
If your answer ends with 5, increase the preceding number by1 if it is odd.
Leave the preceding number unchanged if it is even. For example, 18.35
can be rounded to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded to 18.2.
Reporting Volume Using Significant Digits
Problem
A student measured a regularly shaped sample of iron and found it
to be 6.78 cm long, 3.906 cm wide, and 11 cm tall. Determine its
volume to the correct number of significant digits.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate the volume of the iron sample. Then you need
to write this volume using the correct number of significant digits.

FROM PAGE 20
What Is Given?
You know the three dimensions of the iron sample.
Length = 6.78 cm (three significant digits)
Width = 3.906 cm (four significant digits)
Height = 11 cm (two significant digits)
Plan Your Strategy
To calculate the volume, use the formula
Volume = Length x Width x Height
V=Ixwxh
Find the value with the smallest number of significant digits. Your
answer can have only this number of significant digits.
Act on Your Strategy
V=Ilxwxh
= 6.78 cm X 3.906 cm X 11 cm
= 291.309 48 cm?
The value 11 cm has the smallest number of significant digits: two.
Thus, your answer can have only two significant digits. In order to
have only two significant digits, you need to put your answer into
scientific notation.
V = 2.9 x 10? cm?
Therefore, the volume is 2.9 x 10? cm?, to two significant digits.
Check Your Solution
e Your answer is in cm’®. This is a unit of volume.
e Your answer has two significant digits. The least number of
significant digits in the question is also two.

Chemistry, Calculations, and Communication
Mathematical calculations are an important part of chemistry. You will
need your calculation skills to help you investigate many of the topics in
this textbook. You will also need calculation skills to communicate your
measurements and results clearly when you do activities and investiga-
tions. Chemistry, however, is more than measurements and calculations.
Chemistry also involves finding and interpreting patterns. This is the

GETTER) Like all matter, water can change its state when energy is added or removed.
Physical and Chemical Changes in Matter
A change of state alters the appearance of matter. The composition of
matter remains the same, however, regardless of its state. For example, ice,
liquid water, and water vapour are all the same kind of matter: water.
Melting and boiling other kinds of matter have the same result. The
appearance and some other physical properties change, but the matter
retains its identity—its composition. Changes that affect the physical
appearance of matter, but not its composition, are physical changes.
Figure 1.10 shows a different kind of change involving water.
Electrical energy is passed through water, causing it to decompose. Two
completely different kinds of matter result from this process: hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas. These gases have physical and chemical properties that
are different from the properties of water and from each other’s properties.
Therefore, decomposing water is a change that affects the composition of
water. Changes that alter the composition of matter are called chemical | Figure 1.10, An electrical

Classifying Matter
All matter can be classified into two groups: mixtures and pure sub-
stances. A mixture is a physical combination of two or more kinds of
matter. For example, soil is a mixture of sand, clay, silt, and decom-
posed leaves and animal bodies. If you look at soil under a magnifying
glass, you can see these different components. Figure 1.11 shows
another way to see the components of soil.
The components in a mixture can occur in different proportions
(relative quantities). Each individual component retains its identity.
Mixtures in which the different components are clearly visible are
called heterogeneous mixtures. The prefix “hetero-” comes from the
Greek word heteros, meaning “different.”
Mixtures in which the components are blended together so well
that the mixture looks like just one substance are called homogeneous

A pure substance has a definite composition, which stays the same

Section Wrap-up
Notice that the classification system for matter, shown in the Concept
Organizer, is based mainly on the changes that matter undergoes:
e physical changes to separate mixtures into elements or compounds
e chemical changes to convert compounds or elements into different
compounds or elements
To explain how and why these chemical changes occur, you must look
“deeper” into matter. You must look at its composition. This is what you
will do in the next chapter. You will see how examining the composition
of matter leads to a different classification system: the periodic table. You
will also see how the periodic table allows chemists to make predictions
about the properties and behaviour of matter.

As you know, the nucleus of an atom also contains neutrons. In fact,
the mass of an atom is due to the combined masses of its protons and
neutrons. Therefore, an element’s mass number (symbol A) is the total
number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of one of its atoms. Each
proton or neutron is counted as one unit of the mass number. For exam-

the element fluorine: 13F. The mass number (the superscript 19) indicates
that fluorine has a total of 19 protons and neutrons. The atomic number
(subscript 9) indicates that fluorine has 9 protons. Neither the mass num-

can calculate this value, however, by subtracting the atomic number from
the mass number.

Electrons and Energy Levels
Electrons cannot move haphazardly. Their
movement around an atomic nucleus is restricted
to fixed regions of space. These regions are three-
dimensional, similar to the layers of an onion.
Figure 2.8 shows a representation of these
regions. Keep in mind that they are not solid.
They are volumes of space in which electrons may
be found. You may have heard these regions
called energy shells or shells. In this textbook,
they are called energy levels. An electron that
is moving in a lower energy level is close to the
nucleus. It has less energy than it would if it
were moving in a higher energy level.

GPETIAEATY The “long form” of the periodic table includes the inner transition metals
in their proper place.
The Group-Related Pattern
The second pattern emerges when you consider the electron arrangements
in the main-group elements: the elements in Groups 1 (IA), 2 (IIA), and
13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIA). All the elements in each main group have the same
number of electrons in their highest (outer) energy level. The electrons
that occupy the outer energy level are called valence electrons. The term
“valence” comes from a Latin word that means “to be strong.” “Valence
electrons” is a suitable name because the outer energy level electrons are
the electrons involved when atoms form compounds. In other words,
valence electrons are responsible for the chemical behaviour of elements.
Chapter 2 Elements and the Periodic Tables MHR 45
You can infer the number of valence electrons in any main-group
element from its group number. For example, Group 1 (IA) elements have
one valence electron. Group 2 (IIA) elements have two valence electrons.
For elements in Groups 13 (IIA) to 18 (VIIA), the number of valence
electrons is the same as the second digit in the current numbering system.
It is the same as the only digit in the older numbering system. For exam-
ple, elements in Group 15 (VA) have 5 valence electrons. The elements in
Group 17 (VIIA) have 7 valence electrons.
Using Lewis Structures to Represent Valence Electrons
It is time-consuming to draw electron arrangements using Bohr-Rutherford
diagrams. It is much simpler to use Lewis structures to represent elements
and the valence electrons of their atoms. To draw a Lewis structure, you
replace the nucleus and inner energy levels of an atom with its atomic
symbol. Then you place dots around the atomic symbol to represent the
valence electrons. The order in which you place the first four dots
is up to you. You may find it simplest to start at the top and proceed
clockwise: right, then bottom, then left.
Examine Figure 2.11, and then complete the Practice Problems that
follow. In Chapter 3, you will use Lewis structures to help you visualize
what happens when atoms combine to form compounds.

The Significance of a Full Outer Energy Level
The noble gases in Group 18 (VIIIA) are the only elements that exist as
individual atoms in nature. They are extremely unreactive. They do not
naturally form compounds with other atoms. (Scientists have manipulated
several of these elements in the laboratory to make them react, however.)
What is it about the noble gases that explains this behaviour?
Recall that chemical reactivity is determined by valence electrons.
Thus, there must be something about the arrangement of the electrons in
the noble gases that explains their unreactivity. All the noble gases have
outer energy levels that are completely filled with the maximum number
of electrons. Helium has a full outer energy level of two valence electrons.
The other noble gases have eight valence electrons in the outer energy
level. Chemists reason that having a full outer energy level must be a very
stable electron arrangement.
What does this stability mean? It means that a full outer energy level
is unlikely to change. Scientists have observed that, in nature, situations
or systems of lower energy are favoured over situations or systems of
higher energy. For example, a book on a high shelf has more potential
energy (is less stable) than a book on a lower shelf. If you move a book
from a high shelf to a lower shelf, it has less potential energy (is more
stable). If you move a book to the floor, it has low potential energy
(is much more stable).
When atoms have eight electrons in the outer energy level (or two
electrons for hydrogen and helium), chemists say that they have a
stable octet. Often this term is shortened to just octet. An octet is a very
stable electron arrangement. As you will see in Chapter 3, an octet is
often the result of changes in which atoms combine to form compounds.
Section Wrap-up
You have seen that the structure of the periodic table is directly related to
energy levels and arrangements of electrons. The patterns that emerge
from this relationship enable you to predict the number of valence elec-
trons for any main group element. They also enable you to predict the
number of energy levels that an element’s electrons occupy. The relation-
ship between electrons and the position of elements in the periodic table
leads to other patterns, as well. You will examine several of these patterns
in the next section.

Trends for Atomic Size (Radius)
There are two general trends for atomic size:
e As you go down each group in the periodic table, the size of an atom
increases. This makes sense if you consider energy levels. As you go
down a group, the valence electrons occupy an energy level that is
farther and farther from the nucleus. Thus, the valence electrons experi-
ence less attraction for the nucleus. In addition, electrons in the inner
energy levels block, or shield, the valence electrons from the attraction
of the nucleus. As a result, the total volume of the atom, and thus the
size, increases with each additional energy level.
e As you go across a period, the size of an atom decreases. This trend
might surprise you at first, since the number of electrons increases as
you go across a period. You might think that more electrons would
occupy more space, making the atom larger. You might also think that
repulsion from their like charges would force the electrons farther apart.
The size of an atom decreases, however, because the positive charge on
the nucleus also increases across a period. As well, without additional
energy the electrons are restricted to their outer energy level. For exam-
ple, the outer energy level for Period 2 elements is the second energy
level. Electrons cannot move beyond this energy level. As a result, the
positive force exerted by the nucleus pulls the outer electrons closer,
reducing the atom’s total size.
Figure 2.13 summarizes the trends for atomic size. The Practice

these trends.

Trends for lonization Energy
A neutral atom contains equal numbers of positive charges (protons) and
negative charges (electrons). The particle that results when a neutral atom
gains electrons or gives up electrons is called an ion. Thus, an ion is a
charged particle. An atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively
charged anion. An atom that gives up electrons becomes a positively
charged cation. Figure 2.14 shows the formation of ions for several ele-
ments. As you examine the diagrams, pay special attention to
e the energy level from which electrons are gained or given up
e the charge on the ion that is formed when an atom gains or gives up
electrons

(GETTSEXTI These diagrams show the ions that are formed from neutral atoms of
sodium, magnesium, sulfur, and chlorine. What other element has the same electron
arrangement that sodium, magnesium, sulfide, and chloride ions have?
Try to visualize the periodic table as a cylinder, rather than a flat
plane. Can you see a relationship between ion formation and the electron
arrangement of noble gases? Examine Figure 2.14 as well as 2.15 on the
next page. The metals that are main-group elements tend to give up elec-
trons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearest
noble gases. Non-metals tend to gain electrons and form ions that have
the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases. For example,
when a sodium atom gives up its single valence electron, it becomes a
positively charged sodium ion. Its outer electron arrangement is like
neon’s outer electron arrangement. When a fluorine atom gains an
electron, it becomes a negatively charged ion with an outer electron
arrangement like that of neon.
Chapter 2 Elements and the Periodic Tables MHR 53
Figure 2.15 can help you determine the charge on an ion. Count the
number of groups an ion is from the nearest noble gas. That number is
the charge on the ion. For example, aluminum is three groups away
from neon. Thus, an aluminum ion has a charge of 3+. Sulfur is two
groups away from argon. Thus, a sulfide ion has a charge of 2-.
Remember: Metals form positive ions (cations) and non-metals form
negative ions (anions).
It takes energy to overcome the attractive force of a nucleus and pull
an electron away from a neutral atom. The energy that is required to
remove an electron from an atom is called ionization energy. The bar
graph in Figure 2.16 shows the ionization energy that is needed to remove
one electron from the outer energy level of the atoms of the main-group
elements. This energy is called the first ionization energy. It is measured

noble gas electron arrangement. As you can see, atoms that give up electrons easily have low ioniza-
tion energies. You would probably predict that the alkali metals of Group
1 (IA) would have low ionization energies. These elements are, in fact,
extremely reactive because it takes so little energy to remove their single
valence electron.

Summarizing Trends for lonization Energy
Although you can see a few exceptions in Figure 2.16, there are two
general trends for ionization energy:
e Ionization energy tends to decrease down a group. This makes sense in
terms of the energy level that the valence electrons occupy. Electrons in
the outer energy level are farther from the positive force of the nucleus.
Thus, they are easier to remove than electrons in lower energy levels.
e Jonization energy tends to increase across a period. As you go across a
period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer
energy level increases. Thus, more energy is needed to pull an electron
away from its atom. For this trend to be true, you would expect a noble
gas to have the highest ionization energy of all the elements in the same
period. As you can see in Figure 2.16, they do.
Figure 2.17 summarizes these general trends for ionization energy.

to corrosion and high melting point make it

as a protective layer. The oxide also has special

Trends for Electron Affinity
In everyday conversation, if you like something, you may say that you
have an affinity for it. For example, what if you enjoy pizza and detest
asparagus? You may say that you have a high affinity for pizza and a
low affinity for asparagus. If you prefer asparagus to pizza, your affinities
are reversed.
Atoms are not living things, so they do not like or dislike anything.
You know, however, that some atoms have a low attraction for electrons.
Other atoms have a greater attraction for electrons. Electron affinity is a
measure of the change in energy that occurs when an electron is added
to the outer energy level of an atom to form a negative ion.
Figure 2.18 identifies the electron affinities of the main-group
elements. If energy is released when an atom of an element gains an
electron, the electron affinity is expressed as a negative integer. When
energy is absorbed when an electron is added, electron affinity is low, and
is expressed as a positive integer. Notice, for example, that fluorine has
the highest electron affinity (indicated by a large, negative integer). This
indicates that fluorine is very likely to be involved in chemical reactions.
In fact, fluorine is the most reactive of all the elements.
Metals have very low electron affinities. This is especially true for the
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IJA) elements. Atoms of these elements form stable
positive ions. A negative ion that is formed by the elements of these
groups is unstable. It breaks apart into a neutral atom and a free electron.
Examine Figure 2.18. What trends can you observe? How regular are
these trends?

The units for electron affinity are the same as
the units for ionization energy: kJ/mol. High negative numbers
mean a high electron affinity. Low negative numbers and any
positive numbers mean a low electron affinity.

Analyzing the Ice Man’s Axe complication, however. Dating techniques that
were used for the clothing and body suggested
that the “Ice Man” was about 5300 years old.
Bronze implements do not appear in Europe’s fos-

Europeans were using bronze earlier than origi-
nally thought, or the axe was made of a different
material. Copper was consistent with the Ice
Man's age, since it has been used for at least the
past 6000 years.
One technique to determine a metal’s identity
is to dissolve it in acid. The resulting solution is
examined for evidence of ions. Scientists did not
want to damage the precious artifact in any way,
though.
The solution was an analytical technique
called X-ray fluorescence. The object is irradiated
with high-energy X-ray radiation. Its atoms
absorb the radiation, causing electrons from a

Section Wrap-up
Despite some irregularities and exceptions, the following periodic trends
summarize the relationships among atomic size, ionization energy, and
electron affinity:
Trends for atomic size are the reverse of trends for ionization energy
and electron affinity. Larger atoms tend to have lower ionization
energies and lower electron affinities.
Group 16 (VIA) and 17 (VIIA) elements attract electrons strongly. They
do not give up electrons readily. In other words, they have a strong
tendency to form negative ions. Thus, they have high ionization
energies and high electron affinities.
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements give up electrons readily. They have
low or no attraction for electrons. In other words, they have a strong
tendency to form positive ions. Thus, they have low ionization energies
and low electron affinities.
Group 18 (VIIIA) elements do not attract electrons and do not give up
electrons. In other words, they do not naturally form ions. (They are
very stable.) Thus, they have very high ionization energies and very
low electron affinities.

Table Salt: An lonic Compound .
Sodium chloride, NaCl, is a familiar compound. You know it as table salt.
The sodium in sodium chloride plays a vital role in body functions. We
need to ingest about 500 mg of sodium a day. Too much sodium chloride,
however, may contribute to high blood pressure. In the winter, sodium
chloride is put on roads and sidewalks to melt the ice, as shown in
Figure 3.2. Although this use of sodium chloride increases the safety of
pedestrians and drivers, there are several drawbacks. For example, the
saltwater discolours and damages footwear, and it corrodes the metal
bodies of cars and trucks. Also, as shown in Figure 3.3, deer and moose
that are attracted to the salt on the roads can be struck by vehicles.
GEETSE Sodium chloride is
used to melt ice because salt
water has a lower melting point
than pure water.
GPtIoE) This moose was attracted to the sodium chloride that was put on the road
to melt snow and ice. Humans, like most organisms, need sodium to maintain normal
body functions.
Sodium chloride is a typical ionic compound. Like most ionic com-
pounds, it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It melts at a very
high temperature, at 801°C. As well, it dissolves easily in water. A solu-
tion of sodium chloride in water is a good conductor of electricity. Liquid
sodium chloride is also a good electrical conductor.
Carbon Dioxide: A Covalent Compound
The cells of most organisms produce carbon dioxide, CO2,
during cellular respiration: the process that releases energy
from food. Plants, like the ones shown in Figure 3.4, synthe-
size their own food from carbon dioxide and water using
the Sun’s energy.
Carbon dioxide has most of the properties of a typical
covalent compound. It has a low melting point (—79°C). At
certain pressures and temperatures, carbon dioxide is a liq-
uid. Liquid carbon dioxide is a weak conductor of electricity.
GPT Plants use carbon dioxide and water to produce their own
food, using the Sun's energy.
Chapter 3 Chemical Compounds and Bonding » MHR-_‘ 69
Carbon dioxide is somewhat soluble in water, especially at high pressures.
This is why soft drinks are bottled under pressure. When you open a
bottle of pop, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution. Often,
this happens too quickly, as you can see in Figure 3.5. A solution of
carbon dioxide in water is a weak conductor of electricity.
What Is Bonding?
Why are carbon dioxide and sodium chloride so different? Why can we
divide compounds into two categories that display distinct physical
properties? The answers come from an understanding of chemical bonds:
the forces that attract atoms to each other in compounds. Bonding
involves the interaction between the valence electrons of atoms. Usually
the formation of a bond between two atoms creates a compound that is
more stable than either of the two atoms on their own.
The different properties of ionic and covalent compounds result from
the manner in which chemical bonds form between atoms in these com-

usually occurs between a metal and a non-metal. Recall, from Chapter 2,
that metals have low ionization energies and non-metals have high elec-
tron affinities. That is, metals tend to lose electrons and non-metals tend
to gain them. When atoms exchange electrons, they form an ionic bond.
Atoms can also share electrons. This kind of bond forms between two
non-metals. It can also form between a metal and a non-metal when the
mind metal has a fairly high ionization energy. When atoms share electrons,

a covalent compound. Hydrogen chloride, however, is extremely soluble
in water, and the water solution conducts electricity. These properties are
characteristic of an ionic compound. Is there a clear, theoretical way to
decide whether the bond between hydrogen and chlorine is ionic or
covalent? The answer lies in a periodic trend.
Electronegativity: Attracting Electrons
When two atoms form a bond, each atom attracts the other atom’s
electrons in addition to its own. The electronegativity of an atom is a
measure of an atom’s ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. EN
is used to symbolize electronegativity. There is a specific electronegativity
associated with each element.
As you can see in Figure 3.6, electronegativity is a periodic property,
just as atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity are. Atomic
size, ionization energy, and electron affinity, however, are properties of
single atoms. In contrast, electronegativity is a property of atoms that are
involved in chemical bonding.

Electronegativities
The trend for electronegativity is the reverse of the trend for atomic size. GEISER Electronegativity is

ty increases. Why? The number of protons (which attract electrons) in the
nucleus increases. At the same time, the number of filled, inner electron
energy levels (which shield the protons from valence electrons) remains
the same. Thus the electrons are pulled more tightly to the nucleus,
resulting in a smaller atomic size. The atom attracts a bonding pair of
electrons more strongly, because the bonding pair can move closer to
the nucleus. CHECKP@INT

their electronegativities are not given.
Similarly, as atomic size increases down a group, electronegativity
decreases. As you move down a group, valence electrons are less strongly
attracted to the nucleus because the number of filled electron energy
levels between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. In a
compound, increasing energy levels between valence electrons and the
nucleus mean that the nucleus attracts bonding pairs less strongly.
For example, in Group 2 (IIA), beryllium has the smallest atomic
radius and the largest electronegativity. As atomic size increases down
the group, electronegativity decreases.
Figure 3.7 shows the relationship between atomic size and electro-
negativity for the main-group elements in periods 2 to 6.

Predicting Bond Type Using Electronegativity
You can use the differences between electronegativities to decide whether
the bond between two atoms is ionic or covalent. The symbol AEN stands
for the difference between two electronegativity values. When calculating
the electronegativity difference, the smaller electronegativity is always
subtracted from the larger electronegativity, so that the electronegativity
difference is always positive.
How can the electronegativity difference help you predict the type of
bond? By the end of this section, you will understand the aswer to this
question. Consider three different substances: potassium fluoride, KF,
oxygen, Oz, and hydrochloric acid, HCI. Potassium fluoride is an ionic
compound made up of a metal and a non-metal that have very different
electronegativities. Potassium’s electronegativity is 0.82. Fluorine’s
electronegativity is 3.98. Therefore, AEN for the bond between potassium
and fluorine is 3.16.
Now consider oxygen. This element exists as units of two atoms held
together by covalent bonds. Each oxygen atom has an electronegativity of
3.44. The bond that holds the oxygen atoms together has an electronega-
tivity difference of 0.00 because each atom in an oxygen molecule has an
equal attraction for the bonding pair of electrons.
Finally, consider hydrogen chloride, or hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen
has an electronegativity of 2.20, and chlorine has an electronegativity of
3.16. Therefore, the electronegativity difference for the chemical bond in
hydrochloric acid, HCl, is 0.96. Hydrogen chloride is a gas at room tem-
perature, but its water solution conducts electricity. Is hydrogen chloride
a covalent compound or an ionic compound? Its AEN can help you
decide, as you will see below.
72 MHR- Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
The Range of Electronegativity Differences
When two atoms have electronegativities that are identical, as in oxygen,
they share their bonding pair of electrons equally between them in a
covalent bond. When two atoms have electronegativities that are very dif-
ferent, as in potassium fluoride, the atom with the lower electronegativity
loses an electron to the atom with the higher electronegativity. In
potassium fluoride, potassium gives up its valence electron to fluorine.
Therefore, the bond is ionic.
It is not always clear whether atoms share electrons or transfer them.
Atoms with different electronegativities can share electrons unequally
without exchanging them. How unequal does the sharing have to be
before the bond is considered ionic?
Figure 3.8 shows the range of electronegativity differences. These
values go from mostly covalent at 0.0 to mostly ionic at 3.3. Chemists
consider bonds with an electronegativity difference that is greater than
1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity difference that is less
than 1.7 to be covalent.

they have characteristics of both types of bonding.

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you learned that most elements do not exist in their pure
form in nature. Rather, they exist as different compounds. You reviewed
the characteristic properties of ionic and covalent compounds. You
considered the periodic nature of electronegativity, and you learned how
to use the electronegativity difference to predict the type of bond. You
learned, for example, that ionic bonds form between two atoms with very
different electronegativities.
In section 3.2, you will explore ionic and covalent bonding in terms
of electron transfer and sharing. You will use your understanding of
the nature of bonding to explain some properties of ionic and covalent
compounds.

Ionic and Covalent
Bonding: The Octet Rule
In section 3.1, you reviewed your understanding of the physical proper-
ties of covalent and ionic compounds. You learned how to distinguish
between an ionic bond and a covalent bond based on the difference
between the electronegativities of the atoms. By considering what
happens to electrons when atoms form bonds, you will be able to explain
some of the characteristic properties of ionic and covalent compounds.
The Octet Rule
Why do atoms form bonds? When atoms are bonded together, they are
often more stable. We know that noble gases are the most stable elements
in the periodic table. What evidence do we have? The noble gases are
extremely unreactive. They do not tend to form compounds. What do the
noble gases have in common? They have a filled outer electron energy
level. When an atom loses, gains, or shares electrons through bonding
to achieve a filled outer electron energy level, the resulting compound
is often very stable.
According to the octet rule, atoms bond in order to achieve an
electron configuration that is the same as the electron configuration of a
noble gas. When two atoms or ions have the same electron configuration,
they are said to be isoelectronic with one another. For example, Cl” is
isoelectronic with Ar because both have 18 electrons and a filled outer
energy level. This rule is called the octet rule because all the noble gases
(except helium) have eight electrons in their filled outer energy level.
(Recall that helium’s outer electron energy level contains only two
electrons.)
lonic Bonding
In Section 3.1 you learned that the electronegativity
difference for the bond between sodium and chlorine
is 2.1. Thus, the bond is an ionic bond. Sodium has a
very low electronegativity, and chlorine has a very
high electronegativity. Therefore, when sodium and
chlorine interact, sodium transfers its valence electron
to chlorine. As shown in Figure 3.9, sodium becomes
Na* and chlorine becomes CI.
How does the formation of an ionic bond between
sodium and chlorine reflect the octet rule? Neutral
sodium has one valence electron. When it loses this
electron to chlorine, the resulting Na* cation has an
electron energy level that contains eight electrons. It
is isoelectronic with the noble gas neon. On the other
hand, chlorine has an outer electron energy level that

lonic Bonding That Involves More Than Two lons
Sometimes ionic compounds contain more than one atom of each ele-
ment. For example, consider the compound that is formed from calcium
and fluorine. Because the electronegativity difference between calcium
and fluorine is 3.0, you know that a bond between calcium and fluorine
is ionic. Calcium has two electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs
to lose two electrons according to the octet rule. Fluorine has seven elec-
trons in its outer energy level, so it needs to gain one electron, again
according to the octet rule. How do the electrons of these elements
interact so that each element achieves a filled outer energy level?

Ca. ¥ °°
(GPTEGERE These Lewis structures show the formation of bonds between one atom of
calcium and two atoms of fluorine.
Examine Figure 3.11. In an ionic bond, calcium tends to lose two
electrons and fluorine tends to gain one electron. Therefore, one calcium
atom bonds with two fluorine atoms. Calcium loses one of each of its
valence electrons to each fluorine atom. Calcium becomes Ca?*, and
fluorine becomes F-. They form the compound calcium fluoride, CaF.

Explaining the Conductivity of lonic Compounds
Now that you understand the nature of the bonds in ionic compounds,
can you explain some of their properties? Consider electrical conductivity.
Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in their solid state. They are
very good conductors in their liquid state, however, or when they are dis-
solved in water. To explain these properties, ask yourself two questions:
1. What is required for electrical conductivity?
2. What is the structure of ionic compounds in the liquid, solid, and
dissolved states?
An electrical current can flow only if charged particles are available to
move and carry the current. Consider sodium chloride as an example. Is
there a mobile charge in solid sodium chloride? No, there is not. In the
solid state, sodium and chlorine ions are bonded to each other by strong
ionic bonds. Like all solid-state ionic compounds, the ions are arranged
in a rigid lattice formation, as shown in Figure 3.13.
78 = MHR-* Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
In the solid state, the ions cannot move very much. Thus, there is no
mobile charge. Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.

two chlorine atoms bond together, their electronegativity difference is
zero. The electrons are equally attracted to each atom.

Therefore, instead of transferring electrons, the two atoms each share

Multiple Covalent Bonds
Atoms sometimes transfer more than one electron in ionic bonding.
Similarly, in covalent bonding, atoms sometimes need to share two or
three pairs of electrons, according to the octet rule. For example, consider
the familiar diatomic element oxygen. Each oxygen atom has six electrons
in its outer energy level. Therefore, each atom requires two additional

atoms of oxygen.
Double bonds can form between different elements, as well. For
example, consider what happens when carbon bonds to oxygen in carbon
dioxide. To achieve a stable octet, carbon requires four electrons, and
oxygen requires two electrons. Hence, two atoms of oxygen bond to one
atom of carbon. Each oxygen forms a double bond with the carbon, as
shown in Figure 3.18.
When atoms share three pairs of electrons, they form a triple bond.
Diatomic nitrogen contains a triple bond, as you can see in Figure 3.19.

Metallic Bonding
In this chapter, you have seen that non-metals tend to form ionic
bonds with metals. Non-metals tend to form covalent bonds with other
non-metals and with themselves. How do metals bond to each other?
We know that elements that tend to form ionic bonds have very
different electronegativities. Metals bonding to themselves or to other
metals do not have electronegativity differences that are greater than 1.7.
Therefore, metals probably do not form ionic bonds with each other.
Evidence bears this out. A pure metal, such as sodium, is soft enough
to be cut with a butter knife. Other pure metals, such as copper or gold,
can be drawn into wires or hammered into sheets. Ionic
compounds, by contrast, are hard and brittle.
Do metals form covalent bonds with each other? No.
They do not have enough valence electrons to achieve
stable octets by sharing electrons. Although metals do not
form covalent bonds, however, they do share their electrons.
In metallic bonding, atoms release their electrons to a
shared pool of electrons. You can think of a metal as a non-
rigid arrangement of metal ions in a sea of free electrons,
as shown in Figure 3.21. The force that holds metal atoms
together is called a metallic bond. Unlike ionic or covalent
bonding, metallic bonding does not have a particular orien-
tation in space. Because the electrons are free to move, the
metal ions are not rigidly held in a lattice formation.
Therefore, when a hammer pounds metal, the atoms can
slide past one another. This explains why metals can be
easily hammered into sheets.

Polar Covalent Bonds: The “In-Between” Bonds
When two bonding atoms have an electronegativity difference that is
greater than 0.5 but less than 1.7, they are considered to be a particular
type of covalent bond called a polar covalent bond. In a polar covalent
bond, the atoms have significantly different electronegativities. The
electronegativity difference is not great enough, however, for the less
electronegative atom to transfer its valence electrons to the other, more
electronegative atom. The difference is great enough for the bonding
electron pair to spend more time near the more electronegative atom than
the less electronegative atom.
For example, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water has

electron arrangement affects shape. The Lewis structure for water, for
example, shows that the oxygen is surrounded by four electron pairs. As
shown in figure 3.26, two of the pairs are involved in bonding with the
hydrogen atoms and two of the pairs are not. Electron pairs that are not
involved in bonding are called lone pairs. Electron pairs that are involved
in bonding are called bonding pairs.
Electron pairs are arranged around molecules so that they are a maxi-
mum distance from each other. This makes sense, because electrons are
negatively charged and they repel each other. The shape that allows four
electron pairs to be a maximum distance from each other around an atom
is a tetrahedron. Figure 3.27 shows a tetrahedron.
A tetrahedron has
four equal sides. The Shape of a Water Molecule
In a water molecule, there are four electron pairs around the oxygen atom.
Two of these pairs bond with the hydrogen. The electron pairs are
arranged in a shape that is nearly tetrahedral. When you draw the
molecule, however, you draw only the oxygen atom and the two hydrogen
atoms. This is where the bent shape comes from, as you can see in
lone pairs
Figure 3.28.
The Shape of a Carbon Dioxide Molecule
Now consider carbon dioxide, CO. Why does a carbon dioxide molecule
have a linear shape? Examine the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide. The
central carbon atom is surrounded by eight electrons (four pairs), like the
oxygen atom in a water molecule. In a carbon dioxide molecule, though,
all the electrons are involved in bonding. There are no lone pairs. Because
the bonding electrons spend most of their time between the carbon and
oxygen atoms, they are arranged in a straight line. This allows them to be

Polar Bonds and Molecular Shapes
Water molecules are attracted to one another. Because we are surrounded
by water, we are surrounded by evidence of this attraction. Re-examine
the water skier in Figure 3.22. If water molecules did not attract one
another, do you think the spray from the ski would form a “sheet” as
shown? Try filling a glass with water. As you near the rim, add water very
slowly. If you are careful, you can fill the glass so that the water bulges
over the rim. After a rainfall, you have probably seen beads of water on
the surface of vehicles. In Figure 3.32, you can see further evidence of
the attraction of water molecules to one another.
Why do water molecules “stick together”? To answer this question,
you need to consider both the nature of the bonds within a water
molecule and its shape.
GETESESI The shape of water
droplets is evidence that water
molecules are attracted to one
another. This property of water
can be explained by the polarity
of its O—H bonds.
The Polar Water Molecule
First consider the shape of a water molecule. You have discovered that
a water molecule has a bent shape. Each oxygen-hydrogen bond is polar.
The hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom has
a partial negative charge. You know that the bonds are polar, but what
about the molecule as a whole? Because the molecule is bent, there is a
partial negative charge on the oxygen end and a partial positive charge
on the hydrogen end, as shown in Figure 3.33.

Because the water molecule as a whole has a partial negative charge on
one end and a partial positive charge on the other end, it is called a polar
molecule. Because water is polar, its negative and positive ends attract
each other. This explains why liquid water “sticks” to itself. Figure 3.34
shows how water molecules attract each other in the liquid state.

Two other examples of polar molecules are ammonia and hydrogen
chloride, shown in Figures 3.35 and 3.36. Polar molecules are also called
dipolar molecules because they have a negative pole and a positive pole.
The Non-Polar Carbon Dioxide Molecule
The bond between carbon and oxygen is polar. It has an electronegativity

What a Chemical Formula Represents
For covalent compounds, the chemical formula represents how many of
each type of atom are in each molecule. For example, the formula NH;
signifies that a molecule of ammonia contains one nitrogen atom and
three hydrogen atoms. The formula C,H, tells you that a molecule of
propane contains two atoms of carbon and six atoms of hydrogen.
For ionic compounds, the formula represents a ratio rather than
a discrete particle. For example, the formula for magnesium oxide, MgO,
signifies that magnesium and oxygen exist in a one-to-one atomic ratio.
Recall that MgO exists in a lattice structure held together by ionic bonds,
as shown in Figure 3.41. The formula MgO represents the ratio in which
Mg 2+oO ions are present in the compound.

overwhelming, however, when you are dealing with large molecules. Is
there a faster and easier method for writing chemical formulas?
Every element has a certain capacity to combine with other atoms.
An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element, for example, has the capacity to lose
one electron from its valence level in order to bond with another atom.
A number is assigned to each element to describe the element’s bonding
capacity. This number is called the valence. Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements,
such as sodium and lithium, have a valence of +1. The 1 indicates that
these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. This makes
sense, because Group 1 elements have only one electron in their outer
electron energy level. The + indicates that these elements tend to give up
their electrons, becoming positively charged ions. They may transfer their
electrons, or they may attract the electron relatively weakly in a polar
covalent bond.
On the other hand, Group 17 (VIIA) elements (the halogens) have a
valence of -1. Again, the 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one
electron involved in bonding. However, they need to gain an electron to
achieve a stable octet. In general, halogens become more negatively
charged when they participate in bonding.
As a general rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence tells
you the charges on the ions that are formed. If a covalent bond is formed,
the valence tells you how many electrons the atoms contribute to the
covalent bond.
You can use the periodic table to predict valence numbers. For
example, Group 2 (IIA) elements have two electrons in their outer energy
level. To achieve a stable octet, they need to lose these two electrons.
Therefore, the valence for all Group 2 elements is +2.

The smaller atoms of elements in the first two periods usually have only
one common valence, which is easily determined from the periodic table.
Many larger elements, however, have more than one valence because the
electron distribution in these elements is much more complex. Therefore,
you will have to memorize the valences of the elements that are common-

Polyatomic lons
Some compounds contain ions that are made from more than one atom.
These ions are called polyatomic ions. (The prefix poly means “many.”)
Calcium carbonate, CaCO3, which is found in chalk, contains one calcium
cation and one polyatomic anion called carbonate, CO;7-.
Polyatomic ions are in fact charged molecules. For example, the car-
bonate ion consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to three oxygen
atoms. The entire molecule has a charge of —2. Therefore, its valence is —2,
as well. Polyatomic ions remain unchanged in simple chemical reactions
because of the strong bonds that hold the component atoms together. They
behave as a single unit and should be treated as a single ion.
Table 3.4 on the next page gives the valences, formulas, and names of
many common polyatomic ions.

Writing Chemical Formulas Using Valences
You can use valences to write chemical formulas. This method is faster
than using Lewis structures to determine chemical formulas. As well,
you can use this method for both ionic and covalent compounds. In order
to write a chemical formula using valences, you need to know which
elements (or polyatomic ions) are in the compound, and their valences.
You also need to know how to use the zero sum rule: For neutral chemi-
cal formulas containing ions, the sum of positive valences plus negative
valences of the atoms in a compound must equal zero.
In the compound potassium fluoride, KF, each potassium ion has a
charge of +1. Each fluoride ion has a charge of —1. Because there is one of
each ion in the formula, the sum of the valences is zero.

around the polyatomic ion at the beginning.
For example, suppose that you want to write a balanced formula
for a compound that contains potassium and the phosphate ion. Use

Naming Chemical Compounds
When writing a chemical formula, you learned that you write the metal
element first. Similarly, the metal comes first when naming a chemical
compound. For example, sodium chloride is formed from the metal
sodium and the non-metal chlorine. Think of other names you have seen
in this chapter, such as beryllium chloride, calcium oxide, and aluminum
oxide. In each case, the metal is first and the non-metal is second. In other
words, the cation is first and the anion is second. This is just one of the
rules in chemical nomenclature: the system that is used in chemistry for
naming compounds.
A chemical formula identifies a specific chemical compound because
it reveals the composition of the compound. Similarly, the name of a
compound distinguishes the compound from all other compounds.
GPETESEZEY Many common chemicals have trivial, or common, names.
In the early days of chemistry, there were no rules for naming compounds.
Often, compounds received the names of people or places. Some of the
original names are still used today. They are called trivial or common
names because they tell little or nothing about the chemistry of the
compounds. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, is commonly known
as saltpetre. The Greek word for rock is petra, and saltpetre is a salt found
crusted on rocks. The chemical name of a compound of ammonium and
chloride ions, is ammonium chloride NH,Cl. Long before NH.Cl received
this name, however, people commonly referred to it as sal ammoniac.
They mined this ionic compound near the ancient Egyptian temple of
Ammon in Libya. The name sal ammoniac literally means “salt of
Ammon.” Figure 3.43 shows other examples of common (trivial) names
for familiar compounds.
Early chemists routinely gave trivial names to substances before
understanding their chemical structure and behaviour. This situation
changed during the mid- to late-1800s. By this time, chemistry was
firmly established as a science. Chemists observed and discovered new
patterns of chemical relationships (such as periodicity). As well, chemists
discovered new chemical compounds with tremendous frequency. The
rapidly increasing number of chemical compounds required a more
organized method of nomenclature.
Chapter 3 Chemical Compounds and Bonding * MHR_ 101
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) was
formed in 1919 by a group of chemists. The main aim of IUPAC was to
establish international standards for masses, measurement, names, and
symbols used in the discipline of chemistry. To further that aim, IUPAC
developed, and continues to develop, a consistent and thorough system
of nomenclature for compounds.
Table 3.5 contains the IUPAC names of selected common compounds
as well as their common names.

Naming Binary Compounds Containing a Metal and a Non-metal
A binary compound is an inorganic compound that contains two elements.
Binary compounds may contain a metal and a non-metal or two non-
metals. Binary compounds are often ionic compounds. To name a binary
ionic compound, name the cation first and the anion second. For example,
the compound that contains sodium and chlorine is called sodium chlo-
ride.
In the subsections that follow, you will examine the rules for naming
metals and non-metals in binary compounds.
Naming Metals in Chemical Compounds: The Stock System
The less electronegative element in a binary compound is always named
first. Often this element is a metal. You use the same name as the element.
For example, sodium chloride, NaCl, calcium oxide, CaO, and zinc
sulfide, ZnS, contain the metals sodium, calcium, and zinc.
Many of the common metals are transition elements that have more
than one possible valence. For example, tin is able to form the ions Sn?*
and Sn**, iron can form Fe and Fe**, and copper can form Cut and
Cu2*. (The most common transition metals with more than one valence
number are listed in Table 3.3.) The name of a compound must identify
which ion is present in the compound. To do this, the element’s name is
used, followed by the valence in parentheses, written in Roman numerals.
Therefore, Sn** is tin(IV), Fe** is iron(II), and Cu** is copper(II). This
naming method is called the Stock system after Alfred Stock, a German
chemist who first used it. Some examples of Stock system names are
listed in Table 3.6.
102 MHR-= Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
Another Method for Naming Metals with Two Valences
In a method that predates the Stock system, two different endings are
used to distinguish the valences of metals. The ending -ic is used to repre-
sent the /arger valence number. The ending -ous is used to represent
the smaller valence number. Thus, the ions Sn** and Sn** are named
stannous ion and stannic ion. To use this system, you need to know the
Latin name of an element. For example, the two ions of lead are the
plumbous and plumbic ions. See Table 3.6 for more examples.
This naming method has several drawbacks. Many metals have more
than two oxidation numbers. For example, chromium can form three
different ions, and manganese can form five different ions. Another draw-
back is that the name does not tell you what the valence of the metal is.
It only tells you that the valence is the smaller or larger of two.

to hydride, carbon changes to carbide, sulfur changes to sulfide, and
iodine changes to iodide.
Putting It All Together
To name a binary compound containing metal and a non-metal, write the
name of the metal first and the name of the non-metal second. For exam-
ple, a compound that contains potassium as the cation and bromine as the
anion is called potassium bromide. Be sure to indicate the valence if
necessary, using the Stock system. For example, a compound that contains
Pb** and oxygen is called lead(II) oxide.

Chapter 3 Chemical Compounds and Bonding »* MHR_ 103
Naming Compounds That Contain Hydrogen
If a binary compound contains hydrogen as the less electronegative
element, “hydrogen” is used first in the name of the compound. For
example, HCl is called hydrogen chloride and H,S is called hydrogen
sulfide. Sometimes hydrogen can be the anion, usually in a compound
that contains a Group 1 metal. If hydrogen is the anion, its ending must
be changed to -ide. For example, NaH is called sodium hydride and LiH
is called lithium hydride. Hydrogen-containing compounds can also be
formed with the Group 15 elements. These compounds are usually
referred to by their common names as opposed to their IUPAC names. For
example, NH; is called ammonia, PHs is called phosphine, AsH3 is called
arsine, and SbHs is called stibine.
Many compounds that contain hydrogen are also acids. For example,
H2,SO,, hydrogen sulfate, is also called sulfuric acid. You will learn about
acid nomenclature in Chapter 10.

Naming Compounds That Contain Polyatomic lons
Many compounds contain one or more polyatomic ions. Often these
compounds contain three elements, in which case they are called tertiary
compounds. Although they are not binary compounds, they still contain
one type of anion and one type of cation. The same naming rules that
apply to binary compounds apply to these compounds as well. For
example, NH,Cl is called ammonium chloride. NazSOx, is called sodium
sulfate. NiSO, is called nickel(II) sulfate. NHasNO3 is called ammonium
nitrate.
The non-metals in the periodic table are greatly outnumbered by the
metals. There are many negatively charged polyatomic ions, however,
to make up for this. In fact, polyatomic anions are commonly found in
everyday chemicals. Refer back to Table 3.4 for the names of the most
common polyatomic anions.
When you are learning the names of polyatomic ions, you will notice
a pattern. For example, consider the polyatomic ions that contain chlorine
and oxygen:
ClO- hypochlorite
ClO, chlorite
ClO; chlorate
ClO, — perchlorate
Can you see the pattern? Each ion has the same valence, but different
numbers of oxygen atoms. The base ion is the one with the “ate” ending
chlorate. It contains three oxygen atoms. When the ending is changed
to “ite,” subtract an oxygen atom from the chlorate ion. The resulting
chlorite ion contains two oxygen atoms. Add “hypo” to “chlorite,” and
subtract one more oxygen atom. The resulting hypochlorite ion has one
104 MHR-= Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
oxygen atom. Adding “per” to “chlorate,” means that you should add an
oxygen to the chlorate ion. The perchlorate ion has four oxygen atoms.
The base “ate” ions do not always have three oxygen atoms like
chlorate does. Consider the polyatomic ions that contain sulfur and
oxygen. In this case, the base ion, sulfate, SO.?", contains four oxygen
atoms. The sulfite ion, SO3?, therefore contains three oxygen atoms.
The hyposulfite ion, SO,”", contains two oxygen atoms. Once you know
the meanings of the prefixes and suffixes, you need only memorize the
formulas of the “ate” ions. You can work out the formulas for the related
ions using their prefixes and suffixes. The meanings of the prefixes and
suffixes are summarized in Table 3.7. In this table, the “x” stands for the
number of oxygen atoms in the “ate” ion.
Table 3.7 Meaning of prefixes and suffixes

Most skeleton equations, however, are not balanced, such as the one
showing the formation of sodium chloride. Examine Figure 4.2 to see
why. There is one sodium atom on each side of the equation, but there
are two chlorine atoms on the left side and only one chlorine atom on
the right side.
To begin to balance an equation, you can add numbers in front of the
appropriate formulas. The numbers that are placed in front of chemical
formulas are called coefficients. They represent how many of each atom,
molecule, or formula unit take part in each reaction. For example, if you
add a coefficient of 2 to NaCl in the equation in Figure 4.2, you indicate
that two formula units of NaCl are produced in the reaction. Is the equa-

You cannot balance an equation by changing any of the chemical
formulas. The only way to balance a chemical equation is to put the
appropriate numerical coefficient in front of each compound or element
in the equation.
Many skeleton equations are simple enough to balance by a back-and-
forth process of reasoning, as you just saw with the sodium chloride

Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations
More complex chemical equations than the ones you have already tried
can be balanced by using a combination of inspection and trial and error.
Here, however, are some steps to follow.
Step1 Write out the skeleton equation. Ensure that you have copied
all the chemical formulas correctly.
Step2 Begin by balancing the atoms that occur in the largest number
on either side of the equation. Leave hydrogen, oxygen, and
other elements until later.
Step3 Balance any polyatomic ions, such as sulfate, SO,7-, that occur
on both sides of the chemical equation as an ion unit. That is,
do not split a sulfate ion into 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygen
atoms. Balance this ion as one unit.
Step 4 Next, balance any hydrogen or oxygen atoms that occur in a
combined and uncombined state. For example, combined
oxygen might be in the form of CO,2, while uncombined
oxygen occurs as Oz.

In the same way, you can recognize similarities between chemical
reactions and the types of reactants that tend to undergo different types
of reactions. With this knowledge, you can predict what will happen
when one, two, or more substances react. In this section, you will often
see chemical reactions without the subscripts showing the states of matter.
They are omitted deliberately because, in most cases, you are not yet in a
position to predict the states of the products.
Synthesis Reactions
In a synthesis reaction, two or more elements or compounds combine to
form a new substance. Synthesis reactions are also known as combination
or formation reactions. A general equation for a synthesis reaction is
A+BoC
In a simple synthesis reaction, one element reacts with one or more other
elements to form a compound. Two, three, four, or more elements may
react to form a single product, although synthesis reactions involving four
or more reactants are extremely rare. Why do you think this is so? When
two elements react together, the reaction is almost always a synthesis
reaction because the product is almost always a single compound. There
are several types of synthesis reactions. Recognizing the patterns of the
various types of reactions will help you to predict whether substances
will take part in a synthesis reaction.
When a metal or a non-metal element reacts with oxygen, the product
is an oxide. Figure 4.6 shows a familiar example, in which iron reacts
with oxygen according to the following equation:
3Fe(s) + O2() > Fe204(s)

Decomposition Reactions
In a decomposition reaction, a compound breaks down into elements or
other compounds. Therefore, a decomposition reaction is the opposite of
a synthesis reaction. A general formula for a decomposition reaction is:
C+ A+B
The substances that are produced in a decomposition reaction can be
elements or compounds. In the simplest type of decomposition reaction,
a compound breaks down into its component elements. One example is
the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction
occurs when electricity is passed through water. Figure 4.8 shows an
apparatus set up for the decomposition of water.

Combustion Reactions
Combustion reactions form an important class of chemical reactions.
The combustion of fuel—wood, fossil fuel, peat, or dung—has,
throughout history, heated and lit our homes and cooked our food.
The energy produced by combustion reactions moves our airplanes,
trains, trucks, and cars.
A complete combustion reaction is the reaction of a compound or
element with O, to form the most common oxides of the elements that
make up the compound. For example, a carbon-containing compound
undergoes combustion to form carbon dioxide, CO2. A sulfur-contain-
ing compound reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide, SO2.
Combustion reactions are usually accompanied by the production
of light and heat. In the case of carbon-containing compounds,
complete combustion results in the formation of, among other things,
carbon dioxide. For example, methane, CH,, the primary constituent
of natural gas, undergoes complete combustion to form carbon dioxide,
(the most common oxide of carbon), as well as water. This combustion
reaction is represented by the following equation:

hydrogen, and oxygen (such as ethanol, C,H;0H) produces carbon

Chapter 4 Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance * MHR_ 123
Compounds that contain elements other than carbon also undergo
complete combustion to form stable oxides. For instance, sulfur-contain-
ing compounds undergo combustion to form sulfur dioxide, SOz, a
precursor to acid rain. Complete combustion reactions are often also
synthesis reactions. Metals, such as magnesium, undergo combustion
to form their most stable oxide, as shown in Figure 4.11.

you can predict that the following reaction will occur:

Double Displacement Reactions
A double displacement reaction involves the exchange of cations between
two ionic compounds, usually in aqueous (water) solution. A double
displacement reaction is also known as a double replacement reaction.
A general equation for a double displacement reaction is:
AB+CD> CB+AD
In this equation, A and C are cations and B and D are anions.
Consider the following situation. You have two unlabelled beakers.
One contains distilled water, and the other contains salt water. The two
samples look virtually identical. How can you quickly determine which
is the salt water without tasting them? (You should never taste anything
in a chemistry laboratory.)
A common test for the presence of chloride ions in water is the
addition of a few drops of silver nitrate solution. The formation of a
white solid indicates the presence of chloride ions, as you can see in
Figure 4.14.
A double displacement reaction has occurred. That is, the cations
in the reactants have essentially changed places. This switch is
modelled in Figure 4.15.
When a few drops
of silver nitrate, AgNOs, are (oN
added to a sample of salt water,
NaCl(aq), a white precipitate of
silver chloride, AgCl, is formed. NaCliaq) + AgNOs3(aq) > AgClis) + NaNO s(aq)
GPFTEEZ SEF Sodium chloride and silver nitrate form ions in solution. When silver ions
and chloride ions come into contact, they form a solid.
Since silver chloride is virtually insoluble in water, it forms a solid
compound, or precipitate.
Double displacement reactions tend to occur in aqueous solution. Not
all ionic compounds, however, will react with one another in this way.
You can tell that a double displacement reaction has taken place in the
following cases:
e a solid (precipitate) forms
¢ a gas is produced
¢ some double displacement reactions also form a molecular compound,
such as water. It is hard to tell when water is formed, because often the
reaction takes place in water.
Double Displacement Reactions that Form a Precipitate
A precipitate is a solid that separates from a solution as the result of a
chemical reaction. You will learn more about precipitates in Chapter 9.
Many double displacement reactions involve the formation of a precipitate.
Examine the double displacement reaction that occurs when aqueous
solutions of barium chloride and potassium sulfate are mixed. A white
precipitate is immediately formed. The equation for the reaction is
BaCly(aq) + K2SOa(aq) — BaSOais) + 2KCl(aq)
132 MHR « Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
You should think about two questions when analyzing a double
displacement reaction.
1. How do we determine the products?
2. Which of the products—if any—will precipitate out of solution?
Barium chloride solution contains Ba?* ions and Cl ions. Potassium
sulfate solution contains K* and SO,” ions. When they are mixed, the
Ba** ions come in contact with SO,?" ions. Because barium sulfate is
insoluble, the product comes out of solution as a solid. The K* ions and
CI ions also come into contact with each other, but potassium chloride is
soluble, so these ions stay in solution.
How do you know that the precipitate is BaSO, and not KCl? More
generally, how can you predict whether a precipitate will be formed in a
double displacement reaction? In this chapter, you will be given informa-
tion on solubility as you need it. You will learn more about how to
predict whether a compound is soluble or not in Chapter 9. Barium
sulfate, BaSO, is not soluble in water, while potassium chloride, KCl,
is. Therefore, a reaction will take place and barium sulfate will be the
precipitate.
In summary, to determine the products and their physical states in a
double displacement reaction, you must first “deconstruct” the reactants.
Then switch the cations, and “reconstruct” the products using proper
chemical formulas. You should then balance the chemical equation. You
will be given information to determine which of the products, if any, will
form a precipitate. Finally, you can write the physical state—(s) or (aq)—
of each product and balance the equation.
Given the following reactants, how would you predict the products
of the reaction and their state? Note that many hydroxide compounds,
including magnesium hydroxide, are insoluble. Potassium cations form
soluble substances with all anions.
MgClo(aq) + KOH aq) —>
Examine figure 4.16 to see how to separate the compounds into ions, Mg?*
and Cl; K* and OH-. Then switch the anions and write chemical formu-
las for the new compounds. Check to ensure your equation is balanced.

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Gas
In certain cases, you know that a double displacement reaction has
occurred because a gas is produced. The gas is formed when one of the
products of the double displacement reaction decomposes to give water
and a gas.
Consider the reaction of aqueous sodium carbonate (washing soda)
and hydrochloric acid, shown in Figure 4.17. Hydrochloric acid is sold at
the hardware store under the common name “muriatic acid.” If you carry
out this reaction, you immediately see the formation of carbon dioxide
gas. The first reaction that takes place is a double displacement reaction.
Determine the products in the following way. Separate the reactions into
ions, and switch the anions. Write chemical formulas for the products
and balance the equation.
NazCOaiaq) + 2HCl(aq) > 2NaCl(aq) + H2CO3 (aq)
But this isn’t all that is happening! The carbonic acid, H,COs, is unstable
and subsequently decomposes to carbon dioxide and water.
H2COs(aq) > H20(e + CO2¢)
Overall, we can write this two-step reaction as follows:
NazCOa(aq) + 2HCl(aq) > 2NaCliaq) + H20e) + COr(g)
Another double displacement reaction results in the formation of
gaseous ammonia, NH;. Ammonia, a pungent-smelling gas, is an impor-
tant industrial chemical. It is used as a fertilizer and, when dissolved in
water, as a household cleaner. Ammonium hydroxide is formed in the

The Formation of Water in a Neutralization Reaction
Neutralization reactions are a special type of double displacement reaction
that produces water. Neutralization involves the reaction of an acid with
a base to form water and an ionic compound. You will learn more about
neutralization reactions in Chapter 10. For example, the neutralization of
hydrogen nitrate (nitric acid) with sodium hydroxide (a base) is a double
displacement reaction.

it is important to understand what it is, how it arises, and how we can
deal with it safely.
Types of Radioactive Decay and Balancing Nuclear Equations
There are three main types of radioactive decay: alpha particle emission,
beta particle emission, and the emission of gamma radiation. When an
unstable isotope undergoes radioactive decay, it produces one or more dif-
ferent isotopes. We represent radioactive decay using a nuclear equation.
Two rules for balancing nuclear equations are given below.

Harriet Brooks is nearly forgotten today, even
though she helped to show that elements could
be transformed. For over a century, chemists had
rejected the dream of the ancient alchemists who
thought that they might turn lead into gold with the
help of the philosopher's stone. They believed that
elements were forever fixed and unchangeable.
Then Harriet Brooks arrived on the scene.
When she joined Rutherford’s team, she was
asked to measure the atomic mass of the isotopes
that make up the mysterious vapour given off by
radium. She determined that its atomic mass was
between 40 and 100, whereas radium was known
to have an atomic mass of over 140. Surely this
was not just a gaseous form of radium. Somehow

Gamma Radiation
Gamma (y) radiation is high energy electromagnetic radiation. It often
accompanies either alpha or beta particle emission. Since gamma
radiation has neither mass nor charge, it is represented as @y, or simply y.
For example, cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope that is found in nuclear
fall-out. It decays with the emission of a beta particle and gamma
radiation, according to the equation
13575 08 — 13“7g 4Ba + j0e + 0oY
How is gamma radiation produced in a radioactive decay? When a
radioactive nucleus emits an alpha or beta particle, the nucleus is often
left in an unstable, high-energy state. The “relaxation” of the nucleus to
a more stable state is accompanied by the emission of gamma radiation.
Nuclear Fission and Fusion
All cases of radioactive decay involve the atom’s nucleus. Since these
processes do not involve the atom’s electrons, they occur regardless of the
chemical environment of the nucleus. For example, radioactive hydrogen-
3, or tritium, will decay by B particle emission whether it is contained in
a water molecule or hydrogen gas, or in a complex protein.

A summary of alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma emission
Many chemical reactions, once begun, can be stopped. For example,
a combustion reaction, such as a fire, can be extinguished before it burns
itself out. Nuclear decay processes, on the other hand, cannot be stopped.
The principles of balancing nuclear equations apply to all nuclear
reactions. Nuclear fission occurs when a highly unstable isotope splits
into smaller particles. Nuclear fission usually has to be induced in a
particle accelerator. Here, an atom can absorb a stream of high-energy
particles such as neutrons, gn. This will cause the atom to split into
smaller fragments.
For example, when uranium-235 absorbs a high energy neutron, jn, it
breaks up, or undergoes fission as follows:
235U + in > 82Brt + 39n
How would you identify the missing particle? Notice that three neutrons,
ou, have a mass number of 3 and a total atomic number of 0. The total
atomic mass on the left side is (235 + 1) = 236. On the right we have
(87 + 3(1)) = 90, and so (236 — 90) = 146 remains. The missing particle
must have a mass number of 146.
The total atomic number on the left is 92. The total atomic number
on the right, not including the missing particle, is 35. This means that
(92 — 35) = 57 is the atomic number of the missing particle. From the
periodic table, atomic number 57 corresponds to La, lanthanum. The
balanced nuclear equation is
235U + jn > 82Br+ M4SLa + 3in
Check your answer by noting that the total mass number and the total
atomic number are the same on both sides.
146 MHR-« Unit 1 Matter and Chemical Bonding
Nuclear fusion occurs when a target nucleus absorbs an accelerated
particle. The reaction that takes place in a hydrogen bomb is a fusion
reaction, as are the reactions that take place within the Sun, shown in
Figure 4.21. Fusion reactions require very high temperatures to proceed
but produce enormous amounts of energy. The fusion reaction that takes
place in a hydrogen bomb is represented by the following equation:

how unstable isotopes behave. In the first three sections, you learned
about chemical reactions. In section 4.4, you learned about different types
of nuclear reactions: reactions in which atoms of one element change into
atoms of another element. In Unit 2, you will learn how stable isotopes
contribute to an indirect counting method for atoms and molecules.

© Nuclear reactors have complex cooling systems that absorb the
heat given off by the fission reaction. The absorbed heat is used to
produce steam to drive a generator, thus producing electrical energy.
Cooling the steam for re-use requires a large amount of cool water,
which is usually obtained from a nearby river or lake. A large amount
of hot water is then released into the river or lake. Do you think this is
a form of pollution? What kinds of problems might warm water cause?

Project
Developing a Background
Many of the chemicals in your school laboratory are
Chemistry Newsletter hazardous. Some are corrosive, some are flammable,
and some are poisonous. Many exhibit these proper-
ties when they are combined. You can work safely
wa
with these chemicals, as long as you treat them with
care and respect, observe proper safety precautions,
and follow the directions that are given by your
teacher and this textbook.
Did you know that many of the chemical products
in your home are hazardous, too? For example, com-
mon household bleach, when used as directed, is safe
for disinfecting and whitening clothing. Hazard labels
on bleaching products, however, warn against mixing
bleach with acids, household ammonia, or products
that contain these chemicals. Bleach, when combined
with acids, produces toxic chlorine gas. The products
of combining bleach with ammonia are explosive.
Most homes contain numerous chemical products,
ranging from cleaners and disinfectants, to fertilizers
and fuels. All potentially hazardous products have a
warning on their containers or on paper inserts in
their packaging. Many, but not all, have a list of the
chemicals they contain. Some hazardous products
advise users only to keep them away from children
and pets.
How much do you know about the safe use of
chemical products? Would you know what to do if an
accidental spill occurred? Would the members of your
family, or people in your community, know what to do?
Challenge
Design, produce, and distribute a newsletter to
inform your community about the safe use of common
chemical products. Include the potential hazards of
these products to living things and the environment.

Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses
In Chapter 2, you learned that the mass of an atom is expressed in
atomic mass units. Atomic mass units are a relative measure, defined by
the mass of carbon-12. According to this definition, one atom of carbon-12
is assigned a mass of 12 u. Stated another way, 1 u = > of the mass of
one atom of carbon-12.
The masses of all other atoms are defined by their relationship to
carbon-12. For example, oxygen-16 has a mass that is 133% of the mass
of carbon-12. Hence the mass of an atom of oxygen-16 is

162 MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical Quantities
Usually, not all the atoms in an element have the same mass. As you
learned in Chapter 2, atoms of the same element that contain different
numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up of
two or more isotopes. Chemists need to account for the presence of iso-
topes when finding the relationship between the mass of a large number
of atoms and the mass of a single atom. To understand why this is impor-
tant, consider the following analogy.
Imagine that you have the task of finding the total mass of 10 000
spoons. If you know the mass of a dessertspoon, can you assume that its
mass represents the average mass of all the spoons? What if the 10 000
spoons include soupspoons, dessertspoons, and tablespoons? If you use
the mass of a dessertspoon to calculate the total mass of all the spoons,
you may obtain a reasonable estimate. Your answer will not be accurate,
however, because each type of spoon has a different mass. You cannot
calculate an accurate average mass for all the spoons based on knowing
the mass of only one type. How can you improve the accuracy of your
answer without determining the mass of all the spoons?

10% magnesium-25, and 11% magnesium-26. Whether the magnesium
is found in a supplement tablet (like the ones on the right) or in seawater
as Mg(OH),, it is always made up of these three isotopes in the same
proportion. The relative amount in which each isotope is present in an
element is called the isotopic abundance. It can be expressed as a percent
or as a decimal fraction. When chemists consider the mass of a sample
containing billions of atoms, they must take the isotopic abundance
into account.
Chapter 5 Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole » MHR_ 163
Average Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table
The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses
of all the element’s isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of each
isotope within the element. The average atomic mass is the mass that is
given for each element in the periodic table.
It is important to interpret averages carefully. For example, in 1996,
the average size of a Canadian family was 3.1. Of course, no one family
actually has 3.1 people. In the same way, while the average atomic mass
of carbon is 12.01 u, no one atom of carbon has a mass of 12.01 u.
Examine Figure 5.3. Since the atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12,
why does the periodic table show a value of 12.01 u, instead of exactly
12 u? Carbon is made up of several isotopes, not just carbon-12. Naturally
occurring carbon contains carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. If all
these isotopes were present in equal amounts, you could simply find
the average of the masses of the isotopes. This average mass would be
about 13 u, since the masses of carbon-13 and carbon-14 are about 13 u
and 14 u respectively.
The isotopes, though, are not present in equal amounts. Carbon-12
comprises 98.9% of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for 1.1%.
Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount—about 1 x 1071°%. It makes
sense that the average mass of all the isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u—very
close to 12—since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.
The only elements with only
one naturally occurring
isotope are beryllium, sodium,
aluminum, and phosphorus.
average atomic mass (u)
(GETEAEEE] The atomic mass that is given in the periodic table represents the average
mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element. It takes into account their
isotopic abundances.
Thus chemists need to know an element’s isotopic abundance and the
mass of each isotope to calculate the average atomic mass. How do
chemists determine the isotopic abundance associated with each element?
How do they find the mass of each isotope? They use a mass
spectrometer, a powerful instrument that generates a magnetic field to
obtain data about the mass and abundance of atoms and molecules. You
will learn more about the mass spectrometer in Tools & Techniques on
page 166. You can use the data obtained with a mass spectrometer to
calculate the average atomic mass given in the periodic table.

This is a weighted average.
Another way to calculate the same weighted average is to consider
the relative abundance of each object. There are six objects in total. A is
present as = (33%) of the total, B is present as = (17%) of the total, and C
is present as 3 (50%) of the total. Thus their average mass can be calculat-
ed in the following way:
(0.33)(1.0 kg) + (0.17)(2.0 kg) + (0.50)(3.0 kg) = 2.2 kg

What Is Given?
Atomic mass of '8B = 10.01 u
Atomic mass of 3B = 11.01 u
From the periodic table, the average atomic mass of boron
is B= 10.81 u.
Plan Your Strategy
Express the abundance of each isotope as a decimal rather than a
percent. The total abundance of both isotopes is therefore 1. Let the
abundance of boron-10 be x. Let the abundance of boron-11 be 1 — x.
Set up an equation, and solve for x.
Act on Your Strategy
Average atomic mass = x(atomic mass B-10) + (1 — x)(atomic mass B-11)
10.81 = x(10.01) + (1 — x)(11.01)
10.81 = 10.01x + 11.01 —11.01x
11.01x — 10.01x = 11.01 — 10.81
xX = 0.2000
The abundance of boron-10 is 0.2000.
The abundance of boron-11 is 1 — x, or 1 — 0.2000 = 0.8000.
The abundance of ‘8B is therefore 20.00%. The abundance
of "1B is 80.00%.
Check Your Solution
The fact that boron-11 comprises 80% of naturally occurring boron
makes sense, because the average atomic mass of boron is 10.81 u.
This is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.

GETISER Copper wire is often
priced by the metre because the
metre is a convenient unit. What
unit do chemists use to work with
large numbers of atoms?
Grouping for Convenience
In a chemistry lab, as well as in other contexts, it is important to be able
to measure amounts accurately and conveniently. When you purchase
headache tablets from a drugstore, you are confident that each tablet
contains the correct amount of the active ingredient. Years of testing and
development have determined the optimum amount of the active ingredi-
ent that you should ingest. If there is too little of the active ingredient, the
tablet may not be effective. If there is too much, the tablet may be harm-
ful. When the tablets are manufactured, the active ingredient needs to be
weighed in bulk. When the tablets are tested, however, to ensure that they
contain the right amount of the active ingredient, chemists need to know
how many molecules of the substance are present. How do chemists
group particles so that they know how many are present in a given mass
of substance?
On its own, the mass of a chemical is not very useful to a chemist.
The chemical reactions that take place depend on the number of atoms
present, not on their masses. Since atoms are far too small and numerous
to count, you need a way to relate the numbers of atoms to masses that
can be measured.
Chapter 5 Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole » MHR_ 171
When many items in a large set need to be counted, it is often useful
to work with groups of items rather than individual items. When you hear
the word “dozen,” you think of the number 12. It does not matter what
the items are. A dozen refers to the quantity 12 whether the items are eggs
or pencils or baseballs. Table 5.1 lists some common quantities that we
use to deal with everyday items.
Table 5.1 Some Common Quantities
Item | Quantity | Amount
gloves pair 2
soft drinks | six-pack 6
eggs dozen 12
pens gross (12 dozen) 144
paper ream 500
You do not buy eggs one at a time. You purchase them in units of a dozen.
Similarly, your school does not order photocopy paper by the sheet. The
paper is purchased in bundles of 500 sheets, called a ream. It would be
impractical to sell sheets of paper individually.
GFETISEZS Certain items,
because of their size, are often
handled in bulk. Would you
rather count reams of paper or
individual sheets?
The Definition of the Mole
Convenient, or easily measurable, amounts of elements contain huge num-
bers of atoms. Therefore chemists use a quantity that is much larger than a
dozen or a ream to group atoms and molecules together. This quantity is

The Avogadro constant is a huge number. Its magnitude becomes easier
to visualize if you imagine it in terms of ordinary items. For example,
suppose that you created a stack of 6.02 x 107 loonies, as in Figure 5.7.
To determine the height of the stack, you could determine the height of
one loonie and multiply by 6.02 x 1073. The Avogadro constant needs to
be this huge to group single atoms into convenient amounts. What does

What Is Given?
Each round trip is 2 x 5046 km or 10 092 km. A pea has a diameter

particles. As you have seen, there are far too many particles to work with
conveniently. For example, you would never say that you had dissolved

term: molar mass
The Avogadro constant is the factor that converts the relative mass of
individual atoms or molecules, expressed in atomic mass units, to mole
quantities, expressed in grams.
How can you use this relationship to relate mass and moles? The
periodic table tells us the average mass of a single atom in atomic mass
units (u). For example, zinc has an average atomic mass of 65.39 u. One
mole of an element has a mass expressed in grams numerically equivalent
to the element’s average atomic mass expressed in atomic mass units. One
mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g. This relationship allows
chemists to use a balance to count atoms. You can use the periodic table
to determine the mass of one mole of an element.

Converting Between Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles
You can use what you now know about the mole to carry out calculations
involving molar mass and the Avogadro constant. One mole of any
compound or element contains 6.02 x 107° particles. The compound or
element has a mass, in grams, that is determined from the periodic table.
Now that you have learned how the number of particles, number of
moles, and mass of a substance are related, you can convert from one
value to another. Usually chemists convert from moles to mass and from
mass to moles. Mass is a property that can be measured easily. The
following graphic shows the factors used to convert between particles,
moles, and mass. Moles are a convenient way to communicate the amount
of a substance.

Percentage Composition
H Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide contain the same elements but have
5.3% different proportions of these elements. In other words, they are composed
differently. Chemists express the composition of compounds in various
ways. One way is to describe how many moles of each element make up a
mole of a compound. For example, one mole of carbon dioxide contains
one mole of carbon and two moles of oxygen. Another way is to describe
the percent mass of each element in a compound.
The percentage composition of a compound refers to the relative mass
of each element in the compound. In other words, percentage composition
is a statement of the values for mass percent of every element in the com-
pound. For example, the compound vanillin, CgHsO3, has a percentage

information. For example, percentage composition can be determined
experimentally, and then used to help identify the compound.

Calculating Percentage Composition from a Chemical Formula
In the previous Practice Problems, you used mass data to calculate
percentage composition. This skill is useful for interpreting experimental
data when the chemical formula is unknown. Often, however, the
percentage composition is calculated from a known chemical formula.
This is useful when you are interested in extracting a certain element
from a compound. For example, many metals, such as iron and mercury,
exist in mineral form. Mercury is most often found in nature as
mercury(II) sulfide, HgS. Knowing the percentage composition of HgS
helps a metallurgist predict the mass of mercury that can be extracted
from a sample of HgS.
When determining the percentage composition by mass of a
homogeneous sample, the size of the sample does not matter. According
to the law of definite proportions, there is a fixed proportion of each
element in the compound, no matter how much of the compound you
have. This means that you can choose a convenient sample size when
calculating percentage composition from a formula.
If you assume that you have one mole of a compound, you can use the
molar mass of the compound, with its chemical formula, to calculate its
percentage composition. For example, suppose that you want to find the
202) MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical Quantities

of HgS and find the mass percents of mercury and sulfur in one mole of

Tips for Solving Empirical Formula Problems
In the Sample Problem above, the numbers were rounded at each step to
simplify the calculation. To calculate an empirical formula successfully,
however, you should not round the numbers until you have completed
the calculation. Use the maximum number of significant digits that your
calculator will allow, throughout the calculation. Rounding too soon when
calculating an empirical formula may result in getting the wrong answer.

Determining the Empirical Formula by Experiment
In practice, you can determine a compound’s empirical formula by analyz-
ing its percentage composition. There are several different ways to do this.
One way is to use a synthesis reaction in which a sample of an element
with a known mass reacts with another element to form a compound.
Since you know the mass of one of the elements and you can measure
the mass of the compound produced, you can calculate the percentage
composition.
For example, copper reacts with the oxygen in air to form the
green compound copper oxide. Many buildings in Canada, such as the
Parliament buildings in Ottawa, have green roofs that contain some
copper(II) oxide. (See Figure 6.7.) Imagine you have a 5.0 g sample of

A large number of important chemicals are composed of hydrogen, hydrate, anhydrous
carbon, and oxygen. The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer is a
useful instrument for analyzing these chemicals. It allows chemists to
determine the percentage composition of compounds that are made up
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The applications of this instrument
include forensic science, food chemistry, pharmaceuticals and academic

the mass of the carbon dioxide and water separately, we can determine
the mass percent of carbon and hydrogen in the compound.

How do you think you might
For example, many ionic compounds crystallize from a water solution

with water molecules incorporated into their crystal structure, forming a
hydrate. Hydrates have a specific number of water molecules chemically
bonded to each formula unit. A chemist may know the formula of the
ionic part of the hydrate but not how many water molecules are present
for each formula unit.
Epsom salts, for example, consist of crystals of magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate, MgSO,:7H.O. Every formula unit of magnesium sulfate has
seven molecules of water weakly bonded to it. A raised dot in a chemical
formula, in front of one or more water molecules, denotes a hydrated
compound. Note that the dot does not include multiplication, but rather a
weak bond between an ionic compound and one or more water molecules.
Some other examples of hydrates are shown in Table 6.4.
Compounds that have no water molecules incorporated into them
are called anhydrous to distinguish them from their hydrated forms. For
example, a chemist might refer to CaSO, as anhydrous calcium sulfate.
This is because it is often found in hydrated form as calcium sulfate
dihydrate, shown in Figure 6.9.

water molecules that are in the compound. For example, the molar mass common name for calcium sulfate
of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate includes the mass of 7 mol of water. dihydrate, CaSO,-2H,0.
It is very important to know whether a compound exists as a hydrate. For
example, if a chemical reaction calls for 0.25 mol of copper(II) chloride,
you need to know whether you are dealing with anhydrous copper(I])
chloride or with copper(II) chloride dihydrate, shown in Figure 6.10. The
mass of 0.25 mol of CuCl, is 33.61 g. The mass of 0.25 mol of CuCl,-2H,O
is 38.11 g.
Calculations involving hydrates involve using the same techniques
you have already practised for determining percent by mass, empirical
formulas, and molecular formulas.
The following Sample Problem shows how to find the percent by mass
of water in a hydrate. It also shows how to determine the formula
of a hydrate based on an incomplete chemical formula.

Section Wrap-up
In section 6.4, you learned several practical methods for determining
empirical and molecular formulas of compounds. You may have noticed
that these methods work because compounds react in predictable ways.
For example, you learned that a compound containing carbon and
hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. From
the mass of the products, you can determine the amount of carbon and
hydrogen in the reactant. You also learned that a hydrate decomposes
when it is heated to form water and an anhydrous compound. Again, the
mass of one of the products of this reaction helps you identify the reactant.
In Chapter 7, you will learn more about how to use the information from
chemical reactions in order to do quantitative calculations.

Particle Relationships in a Balanced Chemical Equation
As you learned in Chapter 4, the coefficients in front of compounds and
elements in chemical equations tell you how many atoms and molecules
participate in a reaction. A chemical equation can tell you much more,
however. Consider, for example, the equation that describes the produc-
tion of ammonia. Ammonia is an important industrial chemical. Several
of its uses are shown in Figure 7.2 on the following page.
Chapter 7 Quantities in Chemical Reactions * MHR 235
ciecwea Ammonia can be
applied directly to the soil as
a fertilizer. An aqueous (water)
solution of ammonia can be
used as a household cleaner.
Ammonia can be prepared industrially from its elements, using a process
called the Haber Process. The Haber Process is based on the balanced
chemical equation below.
Nag) + 3Ha(g) > 2NH aig)
This equation tells you that one molecule of nitrogen gas reacts with
three molecules of hydrogen gas to form two molecules of ammonia gas.
As you can see in Figure 7.3, there is the same number of each type
of atom on both sides of the equation.
The reaction of
nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas.
You can use a ratio to express the numbers of atoms in the equation,
as follows:
1 molecule Nz: 3 molecules H2: 2 molecules NH3
What happens if you multiply the ratio by 2? You get
2 molecules N2: 6 molecules H2: 4 molecules NH3
This means that two molecules of nitrogen gas react with six molecules of
hydrogen gas to produce four molecules of ammonia gas. Multiplying the
original ratio by one dozen gives the following relationship:
1 dozen molecules Nz: 3 dozen molecules Hz: 2 dozen molecules NH;
Suppose that you want to produce 20 molecules of ammonia. How
many molecules of nitrogen do you need? You know that you need one
molecule of nitrogen for every two molecules of ammonia produced. In
other words, the number of molecules of nitrogen that you need is one
half the number of molecules of ammonia that you want to produce.

Mole Relationships in Chemical Equations
Until now, you have assumed that the coefficients in a chemical equation
represent particles. They can, however, also represent moles. Consider the
following ratio to find out why.
1 molecule N2: 3 molecules H,: 2 molecules NH3
You can multiply the above ratio by the Avogadro constant to obtain
1 x Na molecules Nz: 3 X Na molecules Hz: 2 x Na molecules NH3
This is the same as
1 mol Nz: 3 mol He: 2 mol NH;
So the chemical equation Nog) + 3Hag) > 2NH3) also means that
1 mol of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 mol of hydrogen molecules to
form 2 mol of ammonia molecules. The relationships between moles in a
balanced chemical equation are called mole ratios. For example, the mole
ratio of nitrogen to hydrogen in the equation above is 1 mol N2:3 mol Hz.
The mole ratio of hydrogen to ammonia is 3 mol Hz:2 mol NHs3.
Chapter 7 Quantities in Chemical Reactions » MHR 237
You can manipulate mole ratios in the same way that you can manip-
ulate ratios involving molecules. For example, suppose that you want to
know how many moles of ammonia are produced by 2.8 mol of hydrogen.
You know that you can obtain 2 mol of ammonia for every 3 mol of
hydrogen. Therefore, you multiply the number of moles of hydrogen by
the mole ratio of ammonia to hydrogen. Another way to think about this
is to equate the known mole ratio of hydrogen to ammonia to the
unknown mole ratio of hydrogen to ammonia and solve for the unknown.

Mass Relationships in Chemical Equations
As you have learned, the coefficients in a balanced chemical equation rep-
resent moles as well as particles. Therefore, you can use the molar masses
of reactants and products to determine the mass ratios for a reaction. For
example, consider the equation for the formation of ammonia:
Na) + 3H) > 2NH3¢)
You can find the mass of each substance using the equation m = M x n CHECKP INT
as follows: Refer back to Chapter 5.
1 mol Nz x 28.0 g/mol N, = 28.0 gN, Calculate the molar mass
of No, Hp, and NH3.
3 mol H, x 2.02 g/mol H, = 6.1 g H,
2 mol NH x 17.0 g/mol NH, = 34.1 g NH,
In Table 7.1, you can see how particles, moles, and mass are related in a
chemical equation. Notice that the mass of the product is equal to the
total mass of the reactants. This confirms the law of conservation of mass.

Stoichiometric Mass Calculations
You now know what a balanced chemical equation tells you in terms
of number of particles, number of moles, and mass of products and
reactants. How do you use this information? Because reactants and
products are related by a fixed ratio, if you know the number of moles
of one substance, the balanced equation tells you the number of moles
of all the other substances. In Chapters 5 and 6, you learned how to
convert between particles, moles, and mass. Therefore, ifyou know the
amount of one substance in a chemical reaction (in particles, moles, or
mass), you can calculate the amount of any other substance in the
reaction (in particles, moles, or mass), using the information in the
balanced chemical equation.
You can see that a balanced chemical equation is a powerful tool. It
allows chemists to predict the amount of products that will result from a
reaction involving a known amount of reactants. As well, chemists can
use a balanced equation to calculate the amount of reactants they will
need to produce a desired amount of products. They can also use it to
predict the amount of one reactant they will need to react completely
with another reactant.
Chapter 7 Quantities in Chemical Reactions * MHR 241
Language LINK Stoichiometry is the study of the relative quantities of reactants and
products in chemical reactions. Stoichiometric calculations are used
for many purposes. One purpose is determining how much of a reactant is
The word “stoichiometry” is
derived from two Greek words: needed to carry out a reaction. This kind of knowledge is useful for any
stoikheion, meaning “element,” chemical reaction, and it can even be a matter of life or death.

is passed continuously through canisters of lithium hydroxide granules.
Greek word metron?
The carbon dioxide reacts with the lithium hydroxide in the following
way:
COx(g) + 2LIOH(s) > LizCO3(s) + H2O0¢)
The canisters are changed periodically as the lithium hydroxide reacts.
Engineers must calculate the amount of lithium hydroxide needed to
ensure that the carbon dioxide level is safe. As you learned earlier, every
kilogram counts in space travel. Therefore, a spacecraft cannot carry much
more than the minimum amount.
The concept of stoichiometry
was first described in 1792 by
the German scientist Jeremias
Benjamin Richter (1762-1807).
He stated that “stoichiometry
is the science of measuring
the quantitative proportions or
mass ratios in which chemical
elements stand to one anoth-
er.” Can you think of another
reason why Richter was
famous?
A spacecratt is a closed system. All chemical reactions must be taken into
account when engineers design systems to keep the air breathable.
To determine how much lithium hydroxide is needed, engineers need to
ask and answer two important questions:
e How much carbon dioxide is produced per astronaut each day?
e How much lithium hydroxide is needed per kilogram of carbon
dioxide?
Engineers can answer the first question by experimenting. To answer the
second question, they need to do stoichiometric calculations. Examine the
following Sample Problems to see how these calculations would be done.

A General Process for Solving Stoichiometric Problems
You have just solved several stoichiometric problems. In these problems,
masses of products and reactants were given, and masses were also
required for the answers. Chemists usually need to know what mass
of reactants they require and what mass of products they can expect.
Sometimes, however, a question requires you to work with the number
of moles or particles. Use the same process for solving stoichiometric
problems, whether you are working with mass, moles, or particles:
Step1 Write a balanced chemical equation.
Step 2 If you are given the mass or number of particles of a substance,
convert it to the number of moles.
Step 3 Calculate the number of moles of the required substance based
on the number of moles of the given substance, using the
appropriate mole ratio.
Step 4 Convert the number of moles of the required substance to mass
or number of particles, as directed by the question.
Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to work with mass
and particles.

calculations, you assumed that the reactants and products occurred in the
exact molar ratios shown by the chemical equation. In real life, however,
reactants are often not present in these exact ratios. Similarly, the amount
of product that is predicted by stoichiometry is not always produced.

unnecessary. In an industrial setting, engineers add more carbon, in the

Having one or more reactants in excess is very common.
Another example is seen in gasoline-powered vehicles. Their
operation depends on the reaction between fuel and oxygen.
Normally, the fuel-injection system regulates how much air
enters the combustion chamber, and oxygen is the limiting
reactant. When the fuel is very low, however, fuel becomes
the limiting reactant and the reaction cannot proceed, as in

Determining the Limiting Reactant
The reactant that is completely used up in a chemical reaction is called
the limiting reactant. In other words, the limiting reactant determines
how much product is produced. When the limiting reactant is used up,
the reaction stops. In real-life situations, there is almost always a limiting
reactant.
A reactant that remains after a reaction is over is called the excess
reactant. Once the limiting reactant is used, no more product can be
made, regardless of how much of the excess reactants may be present.
252. MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical Quantities
When you are given amounts of two or more reactants to solve a
stoichiometric problem, you first need to identify the limiting reactant.
One way to do this is to find out how much product would be produced
by each reactant if the other reactant were present in excess. The reactant
that produces the least amount of product is the limiting reactant.
Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to use this approach to
identify the limiting reactant.

limiting reactant.
What Is Required?
You need to determine whether lithium nitride or water is the
limiting reactant.
What Is Given?
Reactant: lithium nitride, LisN — 4.87 g
Reactant: water, H20 > 5.80 ¢g

The water would produce less ammonia than the lithium nitride.
Therefore, the limiting reactant is water. Notice that there is more
water than lithium nitride, in terms of mass and moles. Water is the
limiting reactant, however, because 3 mol of water are needed to
react with 1 mol of lithium nitride.
Check Your Solution
According to the balanced chemical equation, the ratio of lithium
nitride to water is 1/3. The ratio of lithium nitride to water, based
on the mole amounts calculated, is 0.14:0.32. Divide this ratio by
0.14 to get 1.0:2.3. For each mole of lithium nitride, there are only
2.3 mol water. However, 3 mol are required by stoichiometry.
Therefore, water is the limiting reactant.

The Limiting Reactant in Stoichiometric Problems
halan vs |} AMiIral aval
You are now ready to use what you know about finding the limiting reac-
tant to predict the amount of product that is expected in a reaction. This
type of prediction is a routine part of a chemist’s job, both in academic
research and industry. To produce a compound, for example, chemists
need to know how much product they can expect from a given reaction.
In analytical chemistry, chemists often analyze an impure substance by
allowing it to react in a known reaction. They predict the expected mass
of the product(s) and compare it with the actual mass of the product(s)
obtained. Then they can determine the purity of the compound.
Since chemical reactions usually occur with one or more of the
reactants in excess, you often need to determine the limiting reactant
before you carry out stoichiometric calculations. You can incorporate
this step into the process you have been using to solve stoichiometric
problems, as shown in Figure 7.7.

the limiting reactant in any

Theoretical Yield and Actual Yield

calculated quantity.
Why Actual Yield and Theoretical Yield Are Often Different
The actual yield of chemical reactions is usually less than the theoretical
yield. This is caused by a variety of factors. For example, sometimes less
than perfect collection techniques contribute to a lower than expected
yield.
A reduced yield may also be caused by a competing reaction: a
reaction that occurs at the same time as the principal reaction and
involves its reactants and/or products. For example, phosphorus reacts
with chlorine to form phosphorus trichloride. Some of the phosphorus
trichloride, however, can then react with chlorine to form phosphorus
pentachloride.
260 MHR-= Unit 2 Chemical Quantities
Here are the chemical equations for these competing reactions
2P(s) + 3Clag) > 2PCls(30)
Therefore, not all the phosphorus is converted to phosphorus
trichloride. So the actual yield of phosphorus trichloride is less than
the theoretical yield.
Experimental design and technique may affect the actual yield, as
well. For example, suppose that you need to obtain a product by filtration.
Some of the product may remain in solution and therefore not be caught
on the filter paper.
Another common cause of reduced yield is impure reactants. The
theoretical yield is calculated based on the assumption that reactants are
pure. You will learn about the effects of impure reactants on page 265.
Calculating Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of a chemical reaction compares the mass of product
obtained by experiment (the actual yield) with the mass of product
determined by stoichiometric calculations (the theoretical yield). It is
calculated as follows:
Percentage yield = ( Actual yield ) x 100%
Theoretical yield
In section 7.1, you looked at the reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen
to produce ammonia. You assumed that all the nitrogen and hydrogen
reacted. Under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, this is a
reasonable assumption. When ammonia is produced industrially, how-

of production. Under these conditions, the actual yield is much less than
the theoretical yield. Examine the next Sample Problem to learn how to

Applications of Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of chemical reactions is extremely important in
industrial chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. For example, the
synthesis of certain drugs involves many sequential chemical reactions.
Often each reaction has a low percentage yield. This results in a tiny
overall yield. Research chemists, who generally work with small quanti-
ties of reactants, may be satisfied with a poor yield. Chemical engineers,
on the other hand, work with very large quantities. They may use hun-
dreds or even thousands of kilograms of reactants! A difference of 1%
in the yield of a reaction can translate into thousands of dollars.
The work of a chemist in a laboratory can be likened to making
spaghetti for a family. The work of a chemical engineer, by contrast, is like
making spaghetti for 10 000 people! Learn more about chemical engineers
in Careers in Chemistry on the next page. Then perform an investigation
to determine the percentage yield of a reaction on page 266.
264 MHR-« Unit 2 Chemical Quantities
Chemical Engineer mathematical models. For example, making liquid
pharmaceutical products (such as syrups, solu-
tions, and suspensions) on a large scale involves
adding specific amounts of raw materials to large
mixing tanks. Then the raw materials are heated
to a set temperature and mixed at a set speed
for a given amount of time. The final product is
filtered and stored in holding tanks. Chemical
engineers ensure that each process produces

Percentage Purity
Often impure reactants are the cause of a percentage yield of less than
100%. Impurities cause the mass data to be incorrect. For example, sup-
pose that you have 1.00 g of sodium chloride and you want to carry out a
reaction with it. You think that the sodium chloride may have absorbed
some water, so you do not know exactly how much pure sodium chloride
you have. If you calculate a theoretical yield for your reaction based on
1.00 g of sodium chloride, your actual yield will be less. There is not
1.00 g of sodium chloride in the sample.

itt in the mining industry, metals are usually
FROM PAGE 265 | recovered in the form of an ore. An ore is a
naturally occurring rock that contains a high
concentration of one or more metals. Whether an ore can be
profitably mined depends on several factors: the cost of
mining and refining the ore, the price of the extracted metal,
and the cost of any legal and environmental issues related to
land use. The inaccurate chemical analysis of an ore sample
can cost investors millions of dollars if the ore deposit does
not yield what was expected.
The percentage purity of a sample describes what
proportion, by mass, of the sample is composed of a specific
compound or element. For example, suppose that a sample
of gold has a percentage purity of 98%. This means that
every 100 g of the sample contains 98 g of gold and 2 g of
impurities.
You can apply your knowledge of stoichiometry and
percentage yield to solve problems related to percentage
purity.

Problem
Iron pyrite, FeS2, is known as “fool’s gold” because it looks similar
to gold. Suppose that you have a 13.9 g sample of impure iron pyrite.
(The sample contains a non-reactive impurity.) You heat the sample
in air to produce iron(II) oxide, Fe.03, and sulfur dioxide, SO;.

If you obtain 8.02 g of iron(II) oxide, what was the percentage of
iron pyrite in the original sample? Assume that the reaction proceeds
to completion. That is, all the available iron pyrite reacts completely.
What Is Required?
You need to determine the percentage purity of the iron pyrite sample.
What Is Given?
The mass of Fe2O3 is 8.02 g. The reaction proceeds to completion.
You can assume that sufficient oxygen is present.

Therefore, the percentage purity of the iron pyrite is 86.3%.
Check Your Solution
The units are correct. The molar mass of iron pyrite is 3/4 the
molar mass of iron(II) oxide. Mutiplying this ratio by the mole
ratio of iron pyrite to iron(II) oxide (4/2) and 8 g gives 12 g. The
answer is reasonable.

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you have learned how the amount of products formed
by experiment relates to the theoretical yield predicted by stoichiometry.
You have learned about many factors that affect actual yield, including the
nature of the reaction, experimental design and execution, and the purity
of the reactants. Usually, when you are performing an experiment in a
laboratory, you want to maximize your percentage yield. To do this, you
need to be careful not to contaminate your reactants or lose any products.
Either might affect your actual yield.

yy,
The ability of a solvent to dissolve a solute depends on the forces of
attraction between the particles. There is always some attraction between
solvent and solute particles, so some solute always dissolves. The
solubility of a solute is the amount of solute that dissolves in a given
quantity of solvent, at a certain temperature. For
example, the solubility of sodium chloride in water
at 20°C is 36 g per 100 mL of water.
A saturated solution is formed when no more
solute will dissolve in a solution, and excess solute is
present. For example, 100 mL of a saturated solution
of table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water at 20°C
contains 36 g of sodium chloride. The solution is
saturated with respect to sodium chloride. If more
sodium chloride is added to the solution, it will not
dissolve. The solution may still be able to dissolve
other solutes, however.
An unsaturated solution is a solution that is not
yet saturated. Therefore, it can dissolve more solute.
For example, a solution that contains 20 g of sodium
chloride dissolved in 100 mL of water at 20°C is unsat-
urated. This solution has the potential to dissolve
another 16 g of salt, as Figure 8.4 demonstrates.
The introduction of the alloy bronze around 3000 BcE
led to the production of better-quality tools and weapons.

liquids do not apply to gases in the same way. For example, oxygen is
described as soluble in water. Oxygen from the air dissolves in the water
of lakes and rivers. The solubility of oxygen in fresh water at 20°C is only
9 mg/L, or 0.0009 g/100 mL. This small amount of oxygen is enough to
ensure the survival of aquatic plants and animals. A solid solute with the
same solubility, however, would be described as insoluble in water.

Factors That Affect Rate of

solute that dissolves in a given volume of solvent at a certain temperature.

Fruit juice is soluble in water. The concentrated juice in this photograph,
however, will take a long time to dissolve. Why?
Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving
You may have observed that a solute, such as sugar, dissolves faster in
hot water than in cold water. In fact, for most solid solutes, the rate of
dissolving is greater at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, the
solvent molecules have greater kinetic energy. Thus, they collide with the
undissolved solid molecules more frequently. This increases their rate of
dissolving.
Suppose that you are dissolving a spoonful of sugar in a cup of hot
coffee. How can you make the sugar dissolve even faster? You can stir
the coffee. Agitating a mixture by stirring or by shaking the container
increases the rate of dissolving. Agitation brings fresh solvent into contact
with undissolved solid.
Finally, you may have noticed that a large lump of solid sugar
dissolves more slowly than an equal mass of powdered sugar. Decreasing

attraction between like particles in the mixture, a solution forms. The
strength of each attraction influences the solubility, or the amount of a
solute that dissolves in a solvent.
To make this easier to understand, consider the following three steps
in the process of dissolving a solid in a liquid.
The Process of Dissolving at the Molecular Level
Step1 The forces between the particles in the solid must be broken.
This step always requires energy. In an ionic solid, the forces
that are holding the ions together must be broken. In a molecu-
lar solid, the forces between the molecules must be broken.
Step2 Some of the intermolecular forces between the particles in the
liquid must be broken. This step also requires energy.
Step3 There is an attraction between the particles of the solid and the
particles of the liquid. This step always gives off energy.
The solid is more likely to dissolve in the liquid if the energy change in
step 3 is greater than the sum of the energy changes in steps 1 and 2.
(You will learn more about energy and dissolving in Unit 5.)
Polar and Non-Polar Substances
In the Thought Lab in section 8.1, you observed that solid iodine is
insoluble in water. Only a weak attraction exists between the non-polar
iodine molecules and the polar water molecules. On the other hand, the
intermolecular forces between the water molecules are very strong. As a
result, the water molecules remain attracted to each other rather than
attracting the iodine molecules.
CHECKPOINT

and kerosene are non-polar substances. The attraction that iodine and Remember that the rate at

In Chapter 3, section 3.3, you learned that a water molecule is polar.
It has a relatively large negative charge on the oxygen atom, and positive
charges on both hydrogen atoms. Molecules such as water, which have
charges separated into positive and negative regions, are said to have a

give it a permanent dipole. Dipole-Dipole Attractions
The attraction between the opposite charges on two different polar mole-
cules is called a dipole-dipole attraction. Dipole-dipole attractions are
intermolecular. This means that they act between molecules. Usually they
are only about 1% as strong as an ionic or covalent bond. In water, there
is a special dipole-dipole attraction called hydrogen bonding. It occurs
between the oxygen atom on one molecule and the hydrogen atoms on a
nearby molecule. Hydrogen bonding is much stronger than an ordinary

lon-Dipole Attractions
Ionic crystals consist of repeating patterns of oppositely charged ions, as
shown in Figure 8.9. What happens when an ionic compound comes in
contact with water? The negative end of the dipole on some water mole-
cules attracts the cations on the surface of the ionic crystal. At the same
time, the positive end of the water dipole attracts the anions. These attrac-
tions are known as ion-dipole attractions: attractive forces between an ion
and a polar molecule. If ion-dipole attractions can replace the ionic bonds
between the cations and anions in an ionic compound, the compound
will dissolve. Generally an ionic compound will dissolve in a polar
solvent. For example, table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is an ionic
compound. It dissolves well in water, which is a polar solvent.
When ions are present in an aqueous solution, each ion is hydrated. Nat

are electrolytes.
ace: lon-dipole attrac-
tions help to explain why sodium
chloride dissolves in water.
An Exception: Insoluble lonic Compounds
Although most ionic compounds are soluble in water, some are not very
soluble at all. The attraction between ions is difficult to break. As a result,
compounds with very strong ionic bonds, such as silver chloride, tend to
be less soluble in water than compounds with weak ionic bonds, such as
sodium chloride.
Predicting Solubility
You can predict the solubility of a binary compound, such as mercury(ID)
sulfide, HgS, by comparing the electronegativity of each element in the
compound. If there is a large difference in the two electronegativities, the
bond between the elements is polar or even ionic. This type of compound
probably dissolves in water. If there is only a small difference in the two
electronegativities, the bond is not polar or ionic. This type of compound
probably does not dissolve in water. For example, the electronegativity of
mercury is 1.9. The electronegativity of sulfur is 2.5. The difference in
these two electronegativities is small, only 0.6. Therefore, you can predict
that mercury(II) sulfide is insoluble in water. In Chapter 9, you will learn
another way to predict the solubility of ionic compounds in water.

Insoluble Covalent Compounds
The covalent compounds that are found in oil and grease are insoluble
in water. They have no ions or highly polar bonds, so they cannot form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Non-polar compounds tend to be
soluble in non-polar solvents, such as benzene or kerosene. The forces
between the solute molecules are replaced by the forces between the
solute and solvent molecules.
In general, ionic solutes and polar covalent solutes both dissolve in
polar solvents. Non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents. The
phrase like dissolves like summarizes these observations. It means that
solutes and solvents that have similar properties form solutions.
If a compound has both polar and non-polar components, it may
dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents. For example, acetic acid,
CH;COOH, is a liquid that forms hydrogen bonds with water. It is fully
miscible with water. Acetic acid also dissolves in non-polar solvents,
such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, because the CH; component
is non-polar.
294 MHR- Unit 3 Solutions and Solubility
Factors That Affect Solubility
You have taken a close look at the attractive forces between solute and
solvent particles. Now that you understand why solutes dissolve, it is
time to examine the three factors that affect solubility: molecule size,
temperature, and pressure. Notice that these three factors are similar to
the factors that affect the rate of dissolving. Be careful not to confuse them.
Molecule Size and Solubility
Small molecules are often more soluble than larger molecules. Methanol,
CH;0OH, and ethanol, CH3;CH,OH, are both completely miscible with
water. These compounds have OH groups that form hydrogen bonds with
water. Larger molecules with the same OH group but more carbon atoms,
such as pentanol, CH;CH,CH,CH.CH,0OH, are far less soluble. All three
compounds form hydrogen bonds with water, but the larger pentanol
is less polar overall, making it less soluble. Table 8.2 compares five
molecules by size and solubility.

temperatures, you can make a graph of solubility against temperature. The

Heat Pollution: A Solubility Problem
For most solids, and almost all ionic substances, solubility increases as
the temperature of the solution increases. Gases, on the other hand,
always become Jess soluble as the temperature increases. This is why a
refrigerated soft drink tastes fizzier than the same drink at room tempera-
ture. The warmer drink contains less dissolved carbon dioxide than the
cooler drink.
This property of gases makes heat pollution a serious problem. Many
industries and power plants use water to cool down overheated machin-
ery. The resulting hot water is then returned to local rivers or lakes.
Figure 8.12 shows steam rising from a “heat-polluted” river. Adding
warm water into a river or lake does not seem like actual pollution. The
heat from the water, however, increases the temperature of the body of
water. As the temperature increases, the dissolved oxygen in the water

Pressure and Solubility
The final factor that affects solubility is pressure. Changes in pressure
have hardly any effect on solid and liquid solutions. Such changes do
affect the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent, however. The solubility of
the gas is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the liquid.
For example, the solubility of oxygen in lake water depends on the air
pressure above the lake.
When you open a carbonated drink, you can observe the effect of pres-
sure on solubility. Figure 8.13 shows this effect. Inside a soft drink bottle,
the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas is very high: about 400 kPa. When
you open the bottle, you hear the sound of escaping gas as the pressure is
reduced. Carbon dioxide gas escapes quickly from the bottle, since the
pressure of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is much lower: only
about 0.03 kPa. The solubility of the carbon dioxide in the liquid soft
drink decreases greatly. Bubbles begin to rise in the liquid as gas comes
out of solution and escapes. It takes a while for all the gas to leave the
solution, so you have time to enjoy the taste of the soft drink before it
goes “flat.”

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you examined the factors that affect the rate of dissolving:
temperature, agitation, and particle size. Next you looked at the forces
between solute and solvent particles. Finally, you considered three main
factors that affect solubility: molecule size, temperature, and pressure. In
section 8.3, you will learn about the effects of differing amounts of solute
dissolved in a certain amount of solvent.

It is a volatile chemical. Inhaling phenol adversely affects the central
nervous system, and can lead to a coma. Inhalation is not the only danger.
Coma and death have been known to occur within 10 min after phenol has
contacted the skin. Also, as little as 1 g of phenol can be fatal if swallowed.
Would you expect to find such a hazardous chemical in over-the-
counter medications? Check your medicine cabinet at home. You may
find phenol listed as an ingredient in throat sprays and in lotions to
relieve itching. You may also find it used as an antiseptic or disinfectant.
Is phenol a hazard or a beneficial ingredient in many medicines? This
depends entirely on concentration: the amount of solute per quantity of
solvent. At high concentrations, phenol can kill. At low concentrations,
it is a safe component of certain medicines.
Modern analytical tests allow chemists to detect and measure almost
any chemical at extremely low concentrations. In this section, you will
learn about various ways that chemists use to express the concentration
of a solution. As well, you will find the concentration of a solution by
experiment.
Concentration as a Mass/Volume Percent
Recall that the solubility of a compound at a certain temperature is often
expressed as the mass of the solute per 100 mL of solvent. For example,
you know that the solubility of sodium chloride is 36 g/100 mL of water at
room temperature. The final volume of the sodium chloride solution may
or may not be 100 mL. It is the volume of the solvent that is important.
Chemists often express the concentration of an unsaturated solution
as the mass of solute dissolved per volume of the solution. This is differ-
ent from solubility. It is usually expressed as a percent relationship. A
mass/volume percent gives the mass of solute dissolved in a volume of
solution, expressed as a percent. The mass/volume percent is also referred
to as the percent (m/v).

contains 0.9 g of sodium chloride dissolved in 100 mL of solution, or
0.9% (m/v). Notice that the number of grams of solute per 100 mL of
solution is numerically equal to the mass/volume percent. Explore this
idea further in the following problems.
Solving for a Mass/Volume Percent
Problem
A pharmacist adds 2.00 mL of distilled water to 4.00 g of a powdered
drug. The final volume of the solution is 3.00 mL. What is the
concentration of the drug in g/100 mL of solution? What is the
percent (m/v) of the solution?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate the concentration of the solution, in grams of
solute dissolved in 100 mL of solution. Then you need to express
this concentration as a mass/volume percent.
What Is Given?
The mass of the dissolved solute is 4.00 g. The volume
of the solution is 3.00 mL.
Plan Your Strategy
There are two possible methods for solving this problem.
Method 1
Use the formula
Mass of solute (in g)
Mass/volume percent = x 100%
Volume of solution (in mL)
Method 2
Let x represent the mass of solute dissolved in 100 mL of solution.
The ratio of the dissolved solute, x, in 100 mL of solution must be
the same as the ratio of 4.00 g of solute dissolved in 3.00 mL of
solution. The concentration, expressed in g/100 mL, is numerically
equal to the percent (m/v) of the solution.

Check Your Solution
The units are correct. The numerical answer is large, but this
is reasonable for an extremely soluble solute.
Finding Mass for an (m/v) Concentration
Problem
Many people use a solution of trisodium phosphate, Na3;PO,
(commonly called TSP), to clean walls before putting up wallpaper.
The recommended concentration is 1.7% (m/v). What mass of TSP
is needed to make 2.0 L of solution?
What Is Required?
You need to find the mass of TSP needed to make 2.0 L of solution.
What Is Given?
The concentration of the solution should be 1.7% (m/v). The volume
of solution that is needed is 2.0 L.
Plan Your Strategy
There are two different methods you can use.
Method 1
Use the formula for (m/v) percent. Rearrange the formula to solve for
mass. Then substitute in the known values.
Method 2
The percent (m/v) of the solution is numerically equal to the
concentration in g/100 mL. Let x represent the mass of TSP dis-
solved in 2.0 L of solution. The ratio of dissolved solute in 100 mL
of solution must be the same as the ratio of the mass of solute, x,
dissolved in 2.0 L (2000 mL) of solution.

Concentration as a Mass/Mass Percent
The concentration of a solution that contains a solid solute dissolved in
a liquid solvent can also be expressed as a mass of solute dissolved ina
mass of solution. This is usually expressed as a percent relationship.
A mass/mass percent gives the mass of a solute divided by the mass of
solution, expressed as a percent. The mass/mass percent is also referred to
as the percent (m/m), or the mass percent. It is often inaccurately referred
to as a weight (w/w) percent, as well. Look at your tube of toothpaste, at
home. The percent of sodium fluoride in the toothpaste is usually given as
a w/w percent. This can be confusing, since weight (w) is not the same as
mass (m). In fact, this concentration should be expressed as a mass/mass
percent.
Mass of solute (in g)
Mass/mass percent = Mass of solution (in g) «Tnete)
For example, 100 g of seawater contains 0.129 g of magnesium ion
(along with many other substances). The concentration of Mg”? in
seawater is 0.129 (m/m). Notice that the number of grams of solute
per 100 g of solution is numerically equal to the mass/mass percent.
The concentration of a solid solution, such as an alloy, is usually
expressed as a mass/mass percent. Often the concentration of a particular
alloy may vary. Table 8.3 gives typical compositions of some common
alloys.

Figure 8.16, on the following page, shows two objects made from brass
that have distinctly different colours. The difference in colours reflects the
varying concentrations of the copper and zinc that make up the objects.

Brass can be made using any percent from 50% to 85% copper, and from
15% to 50% zinc. As a result, two objects made of brass can look very different.

When mixing two liquids to form a solution, it is easier to measure their
volumes than their masses. A volume/volume percent gives the volume
of solute divided by the volume of solution, expressed as a percent. The

Molar Concentration
The most useful unit of concentration in chemistry is molar concentra-
tion. Molar concentration is the number of moles of solute in 1 L of
solution. Notice that the volume of the solution in litres is used, rather
than the volume of the solvent in millilitres. Molar concentration is also
known as molarity.
Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L) =
Volume of solution (in L)
This formula can be shortened to give
Cayn
Molar concentration is particularly useful to chemists because it is related
to the number of particles in a solution. None of the other measures of
concentration are related to the number of particles. If you are given the
molar concentration and the volume of a solution, you can calculate the
amount of dissolved solute in moles. This allows you to solve problems
involving quantities in chemical reactions, such as the ones on the
following pages.
Chapter 8 Solutions and Their Concentrations *»MHR_ 313
Calculating Molar Concentration
Problem
A saline solution contains 0.90 g of sodium chloride, NaCl,
dissolved in 100 mL of solution. What is the molar concentration
of the solution?
What Is Required?
You need to find the molar concentration of the solution in mol/L.
What Is Given?
You know that 0.90 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 mL
of solution.
Plan Your Strategy
Step1 To find the amount (in mol) of sodium chloride, first
determine its molar mass. Then divide the amount of
sodium chloride (in g) by its molar mass (in g/mol).
Step 2 Convert the volume of solution from mL to L using this formula:
1.000 L
Volume (in L) = Volume (in mL) x
1000 mL
Step 3 Use the following formula to calculate the molar concentration:
. . —_ Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L) = Volume of solution (in L)
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 Molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 + 35.45
= 58.44 g/mol
0.90 g
Amount of NaCl =
58.44 g/mol
= 1.54x 10 mol
Step 2 Convert the volume from mL to L.
1.000 L
Volume == 100 mi x 1—0_—0_0
= 0.100 L
Step 3 Calculate the molar concentration.
1.54 x 10°? mol
Molar concentration =
0.100 L
= 1.54 x10! mol/L
The molar concentration of the saline solution is 0.15 mol/L.
Check Your Solution
The answer has the correct units for molar concentration.

Using Molar Concentration to Find Mass
Problem
At 20°C, a saturated solution of calcium sulfate, CaSO,, has a
concentration of 0.0153 mol/L. A student takes 65 mL of this
solution and evaporates it. What mass (in g) is left in the
evaporating dish?
What Is Required?
You need to find the mass (in g) of the solute, calcium sulfate.
What Is Given?
The molar concentration is 0.0153 mol/L. The volume of the
solution is 65 mL.
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1 Convert the volume from mL to L using the formula
1.000 L
Volume (in L) = Volume (in mL) x
1000 mL
Step 2 Rearrange the following formula to solve for the amount
of solute (in mol).
—_ Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L) = Volume of solution (in L)
Step 3 Determine the molar mass of calcium sulfate. Use the molar
mass to find the mass in grams, using the formula below:
Mass (in g) of CaSO,
= Amount (in mol) x Molar mass of CaSO, (in g/mol)
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 Convert the volume from mL to L.
1.000 L
= 0.065 L
Step 2 Rearrange the formula to solve for the amount of solute.
Amount of solute
Mooll ar concenttrraatitoni on = Volume of solutiion
.. Amount of solute = Molar concentration x Volume of solution
= 0.0153 mol/L x 0.065 L
= 9.94 x 10* mol
Step 3 Determine the molar mass. Then find the mass in grams.
Molar mass of CaSO, = 40.08 + 32.07 + (4 x 16.00)
= 136.15 g/mol
Mass (in g) of CaSO, = 9.94 x 10* mol x 136 g/mol
= 0.135 g

A volumetric flask is a pear-shaped glass container with a flat bottom and volumetric flask

to make up standard solutions. They are available in a variety of sizes.
Each size can measure a fixed volume of solution to +0.1 mL at a particu-

first measure the mass of the pure solute. Then you transfer the solute to
the flask using a funnel, as shown in Figure 8.20. At this point, you add

Diluting a Solution
You can make a less concentrated solution of a known solution by adding
a measured amount of additional solvent to the standard solution. The
number of molecules, or moles, of solute that is present remains the same
before and after the dilution. (See Figure 8.23.)
To reinforce these ideas, read through the Sample Problem below.

Diluting Concentrated Acids
The acids that you use in your investigations are bought as concentrated
standard solutions. Sulfuric acid is usually bought as an 18 mol/L solu-
tion. Hydrochloric acid is usually bought as a 12 mol/L solution. These
acids are far too dangerous for you to use at these concentrations. Your
teacher dilutes concentrated acids, following a procedure that minimizes
the hazards involved.
Concentrated acids should be diluted in a fume hood because
breathing in the fumes causes acid to form in air passages and lungs.
Rubber gloves must be used to protect the hands. A lab coat is needed
to protect clothing. Even small splashes of a concentrated acid will form
holes in fabric. Safety goggles, or even a full-face shield, are essential.

The Effect of lon Size on Solubility
When an atom gives up or gains an electron, the size of the ion that results
is different from the size of the original atom. In Figure 9.2A, for example,
you can see that the sodium ion is smaller than the sodium atom. In
general, the ions of metals tend to be smaller than their corresponding
neutral atoms. For the ions of non-metals, the reverse is true. The ions of
non-metals tend to be larger than their corresponding neutral atoms.
Small ions bond more closely together than large ions. Thus, the bond
between small ions is stronger than the bond between large ions with
the same charge. As a result, compounds with small ions tend to be less
soluble than compounds with large ions. Consider the ions of elements
from Group 17 (VIIA), for example. Recall, from Chapters 2 and 3, that the
size of the ions increases as you go down a family in the periodic table.
(See Figure 9.2B.) Therefore, you would expect that fluoride compounds
are less soluble than chloride, bromide, and iodide compounds. This
tends to be the case.

Soluble or Insoluble: General Solubility Guidelines
As you have seen, nearly all salts that contain the ammonium ion or an
alkali metal are soluble. This observed pattern does not tell you how solu-
ble these salts are, however. As well, it does not tell you whether ammo-
nium chloride is more or less soluble than sodium chloride. Chemists rely
on published data for this information. (See Figure 9.3.)
GPT] Many web sites on
the Internet provide chemical
and physical data for tens of
thousands of compounds. Print
resources, such as The CRC
Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics, provide these data
as well.
Many factors affect solubility. Thus, predicting solubility is neither
straightforward nor simple. Nevertheless, the general solubility guidelines
in Table 9.1 are a useful summary of ionic-compound interactions with
water. To use Table 9.1, remember that a higher guideline number always
takes precedence over a lower guideline number. For example, barium
chloride, BaCl,, is a white crystalline powder. The barium ion, Ba”, is
listed in guideline 4 as insoluble. The chloride ion, CI, is listed in
guideline 3 as soluble. The higher guideline number takes precedence.
Thus, you would predict that barium chloride is soluble.
You will be referring to the general solubility guidelines often in this
chapter and in Chapter 10. They will help you identify salts that are solu-
ble and insoluble in aqueous solutions. Always keep in mind, however,
that water is a powerful solvent. Even an “insoluble” salt may dissolve
enough to present a serious hazard if it is highly poisonous.

Section Wrap-up
In Chapter 8, you focussed mainly on physical changes that involve
solutions. In the first section of this chapter, you observed that mixing
aqueous solutions of ionic compounds may result in either a physical
change (dissolving) or a chemical change (a reaction that forms a precipi-
tate). Chemical changes that involve aqueous solutions, especially ionic
reactions, are common. They occur in the environment, in your body,
and in the bodies of other organisms. In the next section, you will look
more Closely at reactions that involve aqueous solutions. As well, you will
learn how to represent these reactions using a special kind of chemical
equation, called an ionic equation.

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Precipitate
A double displacement reaction that results in the formation of an insolu-
ble substance is often called a precipitation reaction. Figure 9.4 is a clear
example of a precipitation reaction. What if you did not have this photo-
graph, however, and you were unable to do an experiment? Could you
have predicted that mixing Pb(NO3)(aq) and 2KI (aq) would result in an
insoluble compound? Yes. When you are given (on paper) a pair of solu-
tions to be mixed together, start by thinking about the exchange of ions
that may occur. Then use the general solubility guidelines (Table 9.1) to
predict which compounds, if any, are insoluble.
For example, consider lead(IJ) nitrate, Pb(NO3)2, and potassium
iodide, KI. Lead(IJ) nitrate contains Pb*t cations and NO; anions.
Potassium iodide contains K* cations and I anions. Exchanging positive
ions results in lead(II) iodide, Pbl2, and potassium nitrate, KNO3. From
the solubility guidelines, you know that all potassium salts and nitrates
are soluble. Thus, potassium nitrate is soluble. The Pb** ion is listed in
guideline 2 as an insoluble cation. The I ion is listed in guideline 3 as
a soluble anion. Remember that a higher guideline number takes prece-
dence over a lower guideline number. Thus, you can predict that lead(ID)
iodide is insoluble. It will form a precipitate when the solutions are
mixed. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is

(a) Potassium carbonate contains K* and CO3*" ions. Copper(II) sul-
fate contains Cu2* and SO,”" ions. Exchanging positive ions results
in potassium sulfate, K2SO,4, and copper(II) carbonate, CuCQ3.
All potassium salts are soluble, so these ions remain dissolved
in solution.
The copper(II) ion is listed in guideline 5 as a soluble cation. The
carbonate anion is listed in guideline 2 as insoluble. Because
guideline 2 is higher, copper(II) carbonate should be insoluble. So
you can predict that a precipitate forms. The balanced chemical
equation for this reaction is
KzCOs(aq) + CuSOa(aq) > K2SOa(aq) + CUuCO3,s)
(b) Ammonium chloride contains NH,* and Cl ions. Zinc sulfate
consists of Zn** and SO,” ions. Exchanging positive ions results
in ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO,, and zinc chloride, ZnCl.
Since all ammonium salts are soluble, the ammonium sulfate
stays dissolved in solution.
Zinc chloride consists of a guideline 5 soluble cation and a guide-
line 3 soluble anion. Because guideline 3 is higher, zinc chloride
should be soluble. Thus, you can predict that no precipitate forms.

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Gas
Double displacement reactions are responsible for producing a number
of gases. (See Figure 9.5.) These gases include
e hydrogen
e hydrogen sulfide (a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs)
sulfur dioxide (a reactant in forming acid rain)
e carbon dioxide
¢ ammonia
A Reaction that Produces Hydrogen Gas
The alkali metals form bonds with hydrogen to produce compounds
called hydrides. Hydrides react readily with water to produce hydrogen
gas. Examine the following equation for the reaction of lithium hydride,
LiH, with water. If you have difficulty visualizing the ion exchange that

by this double displacement
reaction is carbon dioxide. Sulfides react with certain acids, such as hydrochloric acid, to produce
hydrogen sulfide gas.

A Reaction that Produces Sulfur Dioxide Gas
Some reactions produce a compound that, afterward, decomposes into
a gas and water. Sodium sulfite is used in photography as a preservative.
It reacts with hydrochloric acid to form sulfurous acid. The sulfurous acid
then breaks down into sulfur dioxide gas and water. The net reaction is
the sum of both changes. If the same compound appears on both sides of
an equation (as sulfurous acid, H,SO3, does here), it can be eliminated.
This is just like eliminating terms from an equation in mathematics.
Na2SQOs3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) > 2NaClaq) + HeSOz(aq)
HSO%(aq) — SOo(g) + H20(e)
Therefore, the net reaction is
NazSOx(aq) + 2HClag) > 2NaCl(aq) + SO2(g) + H2O(ey
A Reaction that Produces Carbon Dioxide Gas
The reaction of a carbonate with an acid produces carbonic acid. Carbonic
acid decomposes rapidly into carbon dioxide and water.

Ammonia gas is very soluble in water. You can detect it easily, however,
by its sharp, pungent smell. Ammonia gas can be prepared by the reaction
of an ammonium salt with a base.

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce Water
The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base is a very
important double displacement reaction. In a neutralization reaction,
water results when an H* ion from the acid bonds with an OH” ion
from the base.
H2SO4(aq) + 2NaOH aq) > Na2SOaaq) + 2H20 ve)
Most metal oxides are bases. Therefore, a metal oxide will react with an
acid in a neutralization reaction to form a salt and water.
2HNOa(aq) + MgO.) > Mg(NOs3)o(aq) + H20(e)
Non-metal oxides are acidic. Therefore, a non-metal oxide will react
with a base. This type of reaction is used in the space shuttle. Cabin air
is circulated through canisters of lithium hydroxide (a base) to remove
the carbon dioxide before it can reach dangerous levels.

Representing Aqueous lonic Reactions with Net lonic Equations
Mixing a solution that contains silver ions with a solution that contains
chloride ions produces a white precipitate of silver chloride. There must
have been other ions present in each solution, as well. You know this
because it is impossible to have a solution of just a cation or just an anion.
Perhaps the solution that contained silver ions was prepared using silver
nitrate or silver acetate. Similarly, the solution that contained chloride
ions might have been prepared by dissolving NaCl in water, or perhaps
NH,Cl or another soluble chloride. Any solution that contains Ag" (aq)
will react with any other solution that contains Cl (aq) to form a
precipitate of AgCl;,). The other ions in the solutions are not important
to the net result. These ions are like passive onlookers. They are called
spectator ions.
The reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride can be
represented by the following chemical equation:
AgNOs(aq) + NaCliaq) > NaNOs(aq) + AgCl(s)
This equation does not show the change that occurs, however. It shows
the reactants and products as intact compounds. In reality, soluble ionic
compounds dissociate into their respective ions in solution. So chemists
often use a total ionic equation to show the dissociated ions of the soluble
ionic compounds.
Ag’ (aq) + NOs (aq) + Na‘ (aq) + Cl (aq) > Na‘ (aq) + NOs (aq) + AgCl(s)
Notice that the precipitate, AgCl, is still written as an ionic formula. This
makes sense because precipitates are insoluble, so they do not dissociate
into ions. Also notice that the spectator ions appear on both sides of the
equation. Here is the total ionic equation again, with slashes through the
spectator ions.
Ag" (aq) + NO¥{aq) + Naa + Cl (aq) > Na*tq) + NO¥faq) + AgClis)
If you eliminate the spectator ions, the equation becomes
Ag’ (aq) + Cl (aq) > AgClis)
Chapter 9 Aqueous Solutions * MHR 341
An ionic equation that is written this way, without the spectator ions, is
called a net ionic equation. Before you try writing your own net ionic
equations, examine the guidelines in Table 9.2 below.
Table 9.2 Guidelines for Writing a Net lonic Equation
1. Include only ions and compounds that have reacted. Do not include
spectator ions.
2. Write the soluble ionic compounds as ions. For example, write
NH4*(aq) and Cl (aq), instead of NH4Cltaq).
3. Write insoluble ionic compounds as formulas, not ions. For example,
zinc sulfide is insoluble, so you write it as ZnS;,), not Zn?* and S*.
4. Since covalent compounds do not produce ions in aqueous solution,
write their molecular formulas. Water is a common example,
because it dissociates only very slightly into ions. When a reaction
involves a gas, always include the gas in the net ionic equation.
5. Write strong acids (discussed in the next chapter) in their ionic
form. There are six strong acids:
e hydrochloric acid (write as H*(aq) and Cl (aq), not HClaq))
e hydrobromic acid (write as H'(aq) and Br(aq))
e hydroiodic acid (write as H*(aq) and [ (aq)
e sulfuric acid (write as H*(aq) and SOa(aq))
e nitric acid (write as H'(aq) and NO3 (aq))
e perchloric acid (write as H*(aq) and C1O4 (aq))
All other acids are weak and form few ions. Therefore, write them
in their molecular form.
6. Finally, check that the net ionic equation is balanced for charges as
well as for atoms.

Step1 Start by writing the chemical formulas of the given
compounds.
Step2 Then write the complete chemical equation for the reaction,
using your experience in predicting the formation of a
precipitate.
Step 3 Once you have the chemical equation, you can replace the
chemical formulas of the soluble ionic compounds with their
dissociated ions.
Step 4 This will give you the total ionic equation. Next you can
identify the spectator ions (the ions that appear on both sides
of the equation).
Step5 Finally, by rewriting the total ionic equation without the
spectator ions, you will have the net ionic equation.
Act on Your Strategy
Steps1 and 2 The chemical equation for the reaction is
NagS (aq) + FeSOa(aq) > NazSOa(aq) + FeSis)
Step3 The total ionic equation is
2Na(aq) + S* (aq) + Fe** (aq) + SQZ (aq) > 2Na" (aq) +SO7" (aq) + FeSis)
Step 4 Therefore, the spectator ions are Na‘ (aq) and SOq” (aq).
Step5 The net ionic equation is

Identifying lons in Aqueous Solution
Suppose that you have a sample of water. You want to know what, if any,
ions are dissolved in it. Today technological devices, such as the mass
spectrometer, make this investigative work fairly simple. Before such
devices, however, chemists relied on wet chemical techniques:
experimental tests, such as submitting a sample to a series of double
displacement reactions. Chemists still use wet chemical techniques.
With each reaction, insoluble compounds precipitate out of the solution.
(See Figure 9.6.) This enables the chemist to determine, eventually, the
identity of one or several ions in the solution. This ion-identification
process is an example of qualitative analysis.
Chemists use a range of techniques for qualitative analysis. For exam-
ple, the colour of an aqueous solution can help to identify one of the ions
that it contains. Examine Table 9.3. However, the intensity of ion colour
varies with its concentration in the solution. Also keep in mind that many
ions are colourless in aqueous solution. For example, the cations of ele-
ments from Groups 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA), as well as aluminum, zinc, and
most anions, are colourless. So there are limits to the inferences you can
make if you rely on solution colour alone.
Another qualitative analysis technique is a flame test. A dissolved
ionic compound is placed in a flame. Table 9.4 lists the flame colours
associated with several ions. Notice that all the ions are metallic. The
flame test is only useful for identifying metallic ions in aqueous solution.
Qualitative analysis challenges a chemist’s creative imagination and
chemical understanding. Discover this for yourself in Investigation 9-B.

Limiting Reactant Problems in Aqueous Solutions
In Chapter 7, you learned how to solve limiting reactant problems. You
can always recognize a limiting reactant problem because you are always
given the amounts of both reactants. A key step in a limiting reactant
problem is determining which one of the two reactants is limiting. In
aqueous solutions, this usually means finding the amount of a reactant,
given the volume and concentration of the solution.

Treating Water for Your Home
If you live on a farm or in a remote area, you probably obtain your water
directly from a well on your property. If you live in an urban community,
you probably obtain your water through a municipal or regional water
authority. Before the water is made available to you, it is processed at a
water treatment plant to remove pollutants. Lake, river, or reservoir water
enters the treatment plant, where a number of physical and chemical
processes take place. Figure 9.8 summarizes these processes.

3 A process called flocculation removes suspended particles such as clay and microorganisms. Lime (CaO)
and aluminum sulfate (Al2(SOu)3) are added. They react together to form aluminum hydroxide:
3Ca0(«) + 3H20,) + Als(SO4)3(5) => 2Al(OH)3(5) + 3Ca?* (aq) + 3802 (aq)
Aluminum hydroxide is a sticky gel that traps the finely suspended particles. Lime is a basic oxide, so it
decreases the acidity of the water, and it precipitates some calcium carbonate. The aluminum hydroxide
with its trapped particles settles to the bottom of the tank.
a The water is passed through a bed of graded gravel and sand in a filtering tank.
@ Water is often saturated with oxygen by spraying it into the air, which helps to remove volatile organic
compounds and improves the taste and odour.
® The water receives a second treatment with chlorine to kill bacteria. Ammonia is added to make the
chlorine last longer in the piping. Some municipalities add compounds such as sodium fluoride.
The following processes take place at a water treatment plant. These
processes must ensure that the water meets all the allowable concentrations.

The treatment of waste water (sewage) is often divided into three types:
primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. (See Figure 9.11.)
¢ Primary treatment mainly involves removing solids from waste water
physically, using filters and settling tanks.
e Secondary treatment involves using bacteria to chemically decompose
dissolved and suspended organic compounds.

kills most of the disease-causing micro-organisms. The resulting water is safe for most purposes, but not

made soap using the bases in wood ash. Today, one of Canada’s most

The Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases
In Figure 10.1, you saw evidence that ions are present in solutions of
acids and bases. When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water, for example,
it dissociates (breaks apart) into hydrogen ions and chloride ions.
HCliaq) > A" (aq) + Cl (aq)
When sodium hydroxide dissolves in water, it dissociates to form sodium
ions and hydroxide ions.
NaOH aq) > Na* (aq) + OH (aq)
The dissociations of other acids and bases in water reveal a pattern. This
pattern was first noticed in the late nineteenth century by a Swedish
chemist named Svanté Arrhenius. (See Figure 10.2.)

Limitations of the Arrhenius Theory
The Arrhenius theory is useful if you are interested in the ions that result
when an acid or a base dissociates in water. It also helps explain what
happens when an acid and a base undergo a neutralization reaction. In
such a reaction, an acid combines with a base to form an ionic compound
and water. Examine the following reactions:
HC]l(aq) + NaOH aq) > NaCl(aq) + H20ce)
The net ionic equation for this reaction shows the principal ions in the
Arrhenius theory.
A" (aq) + OH (aq) — H20,e)
Since acids and bases produce hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, water
is an inevitable result of acid-base reactions.
Problems arise with the Arrhenius theory, however. One problem
involves the ion that is responsible for acidity: H*. Look again at the equa-
tion for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid.
HCliaq) —> H*(aq) + Cl (aq)
This dissociation occurs in aqueous solution, but chemists often leave out
H,0 as a component of the reaction. They simply assume that it is there.
What happens if you put H,O into the equation?
HCl(aq) + H20(e) > H*(aq) + Cl (aq) + H20¢e)
Notice that the water is unchanged when the reaction is represented
this way. However, you learned earlier that water is a polar molecule.
The O atom has a partial negative charge, and the H atoms have partial
positive charges. Thus, H,O must interact in some way with the ions H*
and Cl. In fact, chemists made a discovery in the early twentieth century.
They realized that protons do not exist in isolation in aqueous solution.
(The hydrogen ion is simply a proton. It is a positively charged nuclear
particle.) Instead, protons are always hydrated: they are attached to
water molecules. A hydrated proton is called a hydronium ion, H3O0%(aq).
(See Figure 10.3.)
374 MHR-* Unit 3 Solutions and Solubility
GETEEEEEY For convenience,
hydrogen bond chemists often use H*(aq) as

hydronium ion, H30° (aq).
Hydronium ions do not exist
independently. Instead, they form

There is another problem with the Arrhenius theory. Consider the

fact that certain other substances, such as salts that contain carbonate

ions, also have basic properties.
There is yet another problem with the Arrhenius theory. It is limited
to acid-base reactions in a single solvent, water. Many acid-base reactions
take place in other solvents, however.
The Bronsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases
In 1923, two chemists working independently of each other, proposed a
new theory of acids and bases. (See Figure 10.4.) Johannes Brgnsted in
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Thomas Lowry in London, England, proposed
what is called the Brg@nsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases. This theory
overcame the problems related to the Arrhenius theory.

Two molecules or ions that are related by the transfer of a proton are
called a conjugate acid-base pair. (Conjugate means "linked together.")
The conjugate base of an acid is the particle that remains when a proton
is removed from the acid. The conjugate acid of a base is the particle that
results when the base receives the proton from the acid. In the reaction
between hydrochloric acid and water, the hydronium ion is the conjugate
acid of the base, water. The chloride ion is the conjugate base of the acid,
hydrochloric acid.
According to the Brgnsted-Lowry theory, every acid has a conjugate
base, and every base has a conjugate acid. The conjugate base and conju-
gate acid of an acid-base pair are linked by the transfer of a proton. The
conjugate base of the acid-base pair has one less hydrogen than the acid. It
also has one more negative charge than the acid. The conjugate acid of the
acid-base pair has one more hydrogen than the base. It also has one less
negative charge than the base.

The two theories that you have considered in this section attempt to
explain the chemical nature of acids and bases. Table 10.3 summarizes the
key points of these theories.
In both the Arrhenius theory and the Brgnsted-Lowry theory, acids
and bases form ions in solution. Many characteristics of acid-base behav-
iour are linked to the number of ions that form from a particular acid or
base. One of these characteristics is strength.

When hydrogen chloride molecules enter an aqueous solution, 100% of the
hydrogen chloride molecules dissociate. As a result, the solution contains the same per-
cent of H* ions (in the form of H30*) and CI" ions: 100%.
A weak acid is an acid that dissociates very slightly in a water solu-
tion. Thus, only a small percentage of the acid molecules break apart into
ions. Most of the acid molecules remain intact. For example, acetic acid is
a weak acid. On average, only about 1% (one in a hundred) of the acetic
acid molecules dissociate at any given moment in a 0.1 mol/L solution.
(The number of acid molecules that dissociate depends on the concentra-
tion and temperature of the solution.) In fact, the concentration of
hydronium ions in a solution ofa weak acid is always less than the
concentration of the dissolved acid. (See Figure 10.7.)

When acetic acid molecules enter an aqueous solution, only about 1% of
them dissociate. Thus, the number of acetic acid molecules in solution is far greater than
the number of hydronium ions and acetate ions.
Notice the arrow that is used in the equation in Figure 10.7. It points in
both directions, indicating that the reaction is reversible. In other words,
the products of the reaction also react to produce the original reactants. In
this reaction, molecules of acetic acid dissociate just as quickly and as
often as the dissociated ions re-associate to produce acetic acid molecules.
(Figure 10.8 will help you visualize what happens.)
Most acids are weak acids. Whenever you see a reversible chemical
equation involving an acid, you can safely assume that the acid is weak.

When acetic acid dissolves in water, acetic acid molecules dissociate
and re-associate at the same time and at the same rate.
A few acids contain only a single hydrogen ion that can dissociate.
These acids are called monoprotic acids. (The prefix mono- means “one.”
The root -protic refers to “proton.”) Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
and hydroiodic acid are strong monoprotic acids. Hydrofluoric acid, HF, is
weak monoprotic acid.
Many acids contain two or more hydrogen ions that can dissociate.
For example, sulfuric acid, HzSOa(aq), has two hydrogen ions that can dis-
sociate. As you know from Table 10.4, sulfuric acid is a strong acid. This
is true only for its first dissociation, however.
H2SOa(aq) > H*(aq) + HSOg (aq)
The resulting aqueous hydrogen sulfate ion, HSOTM4, is a weak acid. It dis-
sociates to form the sulfate ion in the following reversible reaction:
HSO« (aq) = H*(aq) + SO4” (aq)
382. MHR-« Unit 3 Solutions and Solubility
Thus, acids that contain two hydrogen ions dissociate to form two anions.
These acids are sometimes called diprotic acids. (The prefix di-, as you
know, means “two.”) The acid that is formed by the first dissociation is
stronger than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation.
Acids that contain three hydrogen ions are called triprotic acids.
Phosphoric acid, H3POg(aq), is a triprotic acid. It gives rise to three anions,
as follows:
H3POa(aq) + H20() (aq) + HePOs (aq)
H2PO«g (aq) + H20¢) = Faq) + HPO.” (aq)
HPO4 (aq) + H2O(e) = H* (aq) + POs(*aq)
Here again, the acid that is formed by the first dissociation is stronger
than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation. This acid is
stronger than the acid that is formed by the third dissociation. Keep in
mind, however, that all three of these acids are weak because only a small
proportion of them dissociates.
Strong Bases and Weak Bases
Like a strong acid, a strong base dissociates completely into ions in water. Table 10.5 Common Strong Bases
All oxides and hydroxides of the alkali metals—Group 1 ([A)—are strong sodium hydroxide, NaOH
bases. The oxides and hydroxides of the alkaline earth metals—Group 2

(11A)—below beryllium are also strong bases.
calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH).
Recall that the concentration of hydronium ions in a dilute solution of
a strong acid is equal to the concentration of the acid. Similarly, the con- strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2
centration of hydroxide ions in a dilute solution of a strong base is equal barium hydroxide, Ba(OH),
to the concentration of the base. For example, a 1.0 mol/L solution of
sodium hydroxide (a strong base) contains 1.0 mol/L of hydroxide ions.
Table 10.5 lists some common strong bases. Barium hydroxide,
Ba(OH)2, and strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, are strong bases that are
soluble in water. Magnesium oxide, MgO, and magnesium hydroxide,
Mg(OH)z, are also strong bases, but they are considered to be insoluble.
A small amount of these compounds does dissolve in water, however.
Virtually all of this small amount dissociates completely.
Most bases are weak. A weak base dissociates very slightly in a
water solution. The most common weak base is aqueous ammonia. In a
0.1 mol/L solution, only about 1% of the ammonia molecules react with
water to form hydroxide ions. This reversible reaction is represented in
Figure 10.9.

Ammonia does not contain hydroxide ions, so it is not an Arrhenius base.
As you can see, however, an ammonia molecule can remove a proton from water, leaving
a hydroxide ion behind. Thus, ammonia is a Bransted-Lowry weak base.

Describing Acid and Base Strength Quantitatively: pH
You are probably familiar with the term “pH” from a variety of sources.
Advertisers talk about the “pH balance” of products such as soaps, sham-
poos, and skin creams. People who own aquariums and swimming pools
must monitor the pH of the water. (See Figure 10.10.) Gardeners and farm-
ers use simple tests to determine the pH of the soil. They know that plants
and food crops grow best within a narrow range of pH. Similarly, the pH
of your blood must remain within narrow limits for you to stay healthy.
ems Maintaining a
safe environment for an aquarium
or a swimming pool requires
measuring the pH of the water
= = a a Xx and knowing how to adjust it.
pH is clearly related to health, and to the proper functioning of products
and systems. (Notice that the “p” is always lower case, even at the start
of a sentence.) What exactly is pH? How is it measured? To answer these
questions, consider a familiar substance: water.
The Power of Hydrogen in Water
As you know, all aqueous solutions contain ions. Even pure water con-
tains a few ions that are produced by the dissociation of water molecules.
Remember: The double arrow in the equation shows that the reaction is
reversible. The ions recombine to form water molecules.
H20e) + H20(e) = H30 faq) + OH faq)
On average, at 25°C, only about two water molecules in a billion are
dissociated at any given moment. As you know, it is the ions in solution
that conduct electricity. If there are virtually no ions, no electricity is
conducted. This is why pure water is such a poor conductor. Chemists
have determined that the concentration of hydronium ions in neutral
water, at 25°C, is only 1.0 x 10°’ mol/L. The dissociation of water also
produces the same, very small number of hydroxide ions. Therefore, the
concentration of hydroxide ions is also 1.0 x 10°” mol/L.
Chemists sometimes use square brackets around a chemical formula.
This shorthand notation means “the concentration of” the chemical inside
the brackets. For example, [H3;0*] is read as “the concentration of hydro-
nium ions.” Thus, the concentration of hydronium ions and hydroxide
ions in neutral water can be written as
the concentration of hydronium ions
[H,;0*] = [OH] = 1.0 x 10°” mol/L

Chapter 10 Acids and Bases * MHR_ 385
Compared with neutral water, acidic solutions contain a higher con-
centration of hydronium ions. Basic solutions contain a lower concentra-
tion of hydronium ions. Therefore, the dissociation of water provides
another way of thinking about acids and bases. An acid is any compound
that increases [H;O0*] when it is dissolved in water. A base is any com-
pound that increases [OH] when it is dissolved in water. (See Figure
10.11.)
Bue
[H,0*] > [OH7] [H,0*] <[OH7] [H,O*] = [OH7]
(GGETECSEEDL The relationship between the concentrations of hydronium ions and
hydroxide ions in a solution determines whether the solution is acidic, basic, or neutral.
The pH Scale: Measuring by Powers of Ten
The concentration of hydronium ions ranges from about 10 mol/L for a
concentrated strong acid to about 107'° mol/L for a concentrated strong
base. This wide range of concentrations, and the negative powers of 10,
are not very convenient to work with. In 1909, a Danish biochemist, Sgren
Sgrensen, suggested a method for converting concentrations to positive
numbers. His method involved using the numerical system of logarithms.
The logarithm of a number is the power to which you must raise 10 to
equal that number. For example, the logarithm of 10 is 1, because
10! = 10. The logarithm of 100 is 2, because 107 = 100. (See Appendix E
for more information about exponents and logarithms.)
Sgrensen defined pH as —log [H*]. Since Sgrensen did not know about
hydronium ions, his definition of pH is based on Arrhenius’ hydrogen
ion. Many chemistry references reinterpret the H so that it refers to the
Brensted-Lowry hydronium ion, H;0*, instead. This textbook adopts the
hydronium ion usage. Thus, the definition for pH becomes
pH = -log [H30°]. Recall, though, that chemists use [H*] as a shorthand
notation for [H3;0*]. As a result, both equations give the same product.
As you can see in Figure 10.12, the 66 “p” 39 in pH stands for the word
“power.” The power referred to is exponential power: the power of 10.
The “H” stands for the concentration of hydrogen ions (or H;0* ions),
measured in mol/L.

The concept of pH allows hydronium (or hydrogen) ion concentra-

Cleaners that contain sodium hydroxide and
potassium hydroxide are very effective. They
are also caustic and potentially very dangerous.
For example, sodium hydroxide, in the concen-

irritate the skin and cause blindness if it gets
in the eyes. As well, it is damaging to paints
and fabrics.
There are alternatives to sodium hydroxide
and other strong base cleaners. One alternative
involves using ammonia, NH3, which is a weak

Neutralization Reactions
The reaction between an acid and a base produces an ionic compound
(a salt) and water.
acid + base > a salt + water
A salt is an ionic compound that is composed of the anion from an acid
and a cation from a base. For example, sodium nitrate is a salt that is
found in many kitchens. It is often added to processed meat to preserve
the colour and to slow the rate of spoiling by inhibiting bacterial growth.
Sodium nitrate can be prepared in a laboratory by reacting nitric acid with
sodium hydroxide, as shown on the next page.

Concentration of potassium hydroxide, KOH = 0.650 mol/L
Volume of potassium hydroxide, KOH = 37.2 mL.

GETSETSEY A transfer pipette (bottom) measures a fixed volume of liquid,
such as 10.00 mL, 25.00 mL, or 50.0 mL. A burette (top) measures a variable
volume of liquid.
In a titration, a pipette is used to measure a precise volume of standard
solution into a flask. The flask sits under a burette that contains the
solution of unknown concentration. After adding a few drops of indicator,
you take an initial burette reading. Then you start adding the known solu-
tion, slowly, to the flask. The end-point of the titration occurs when the
indicator changes colour. The indicator is chosen so that it matches its
equivalance point.

Section Wrap-up
In this section, as in much of Unit 3, you combined liquid solutes and
liquid solvents. You have learned how to describe the concentration of
ions that determine the acidic or basic nature of a solution. As well, you
performed calculations to determine the concentration of acids and many
other substances in solution. In the upcoming unit, you will apply your
understanding of stoichiometry and solutions by examining the nature
and interactions of substances in the gaseous state.

The incompressibility of solids and liquids arises instead from the fact

that these particles cannot move independently of each other. That is,
the movement of one particle affects the movement of other particles,
or is restricted by them.
This is especially true for solids. The particles of a solid are held
together in a framework, called a crystal lattice. In a crystal lattice, the
positions of solid particles are relatively fixed. This explains why solids
have definite shapes: the particles are unable to slip past each other and
thus change the shape of the solid.
Like solids, liquid particles cannot move independently of one
another. They can slip past each other enough, however, to flow and
change shape.
Another property of states of matter is their motion. According to the
particle theory, all particles that make up matter are in constant motion.
In solids, the range of motion of the particles is the most restricted. Each
particle of a solid is only able to vibrate around a fixed point in the lattice
(see Figure 11.2). This is called vibrational motion. Since solid particles
are fixed in space, the degree of disorder is very low.
Particles in the liquid state can move more freely than particles in the
solid state, although not entirely independently. Liquid particles move
with rotational motion as well as vibrational motion. This means that the
particles can rotate and change position. It explains why liquids are able
to flow and change shape, but keep the same volume. Since liquid parti-
cles move around more than solid particles, the liquid state has a higher
degree of disorder, as shown in Figure 11.3.

418 MHR- Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry
The Gas State
Unlike solids and liquids, particles in the gaseous state are able to move
independently of one another. Gas particles are able to move from one
point in space to another. This is called translational motion. Thus, gas
particles move with all three types of motion: vibrational, rotational,
and translational. Gas particles move through space in random fashion.
However, they do travel in straight lines until their course is altered by
collisions with other particles. Because gas particles move freely, there is
a high degree of disorder in a gaseous state.
Gas particles move much faster than liquid particles. Liquids
always flow to the lowest point because they are still greatly influenced by
gravity. Because gas particles move so quickly, gravity does not affect
them as much. Gases flow in all directions, including upward against
gravity, until all of the available empty space is occupied. This is why
gases expand to fill a container. (See Figure 11.4.)
Gases can be compressed, unlike both solids and liquids. What is
different about their particle arrangement that allows for this? The space
between gas particles is much larger than the space between liquid or
solid particles. Even if gas particles are moved closer together through
compression, the distance between each particle is still very large. The
particles remain in the gaseous state. When gas molecules are compressed
further, eventually the forces between molecules become strong enough to

Forces Between Particles another.
You have examined some properties of solids, liquids, and gases. You
have seen how the motion of the particles affects these properties. Now
you will examine how the particles affect each other.
The particle theory states that there are attractive forces between
particles. The weaker the attractive force is between particles, the freer the
particles are to move. Therefore, attractive forces between particles are at
their strongest in the solid state. Attractive forces are at their weakest in
the gaseous state.
The strength of attractive forces between particles in any physical
state depends on two major factors: type of force and temperature. The
effect of temperature, or kinetic energy, on the state of a substance will be
covered in greater detail later on in this section.
Attractions Between Charged Particles
What types of attractive forces exist between particles? In Chapter 3, you
learned that oppositely charged particles attract each other due to electro-
static attraction. Ionic bonding is one example of electrostatic attraction.
A positive ion (an atom or molecule that has lost electrons) is attracted to
a negative ion (an atom or molecule that has gained electrons). Ions form
very strong ionic bonds. Since these attractive forces are so strong, ionic
compounds usually exist in nature as solids. For example, table salt
(sodium chloride, NaCl) is a solid crystalline substance. It has a high
melting point and a high boiling point.
GEISER Gas particles move
freely in all directions, bouncing
off each other as well as off the
walls of their container.

Attractions Between Polar Molecules
Not all particles are charged, but attractions can still form between them.
What is a dipole? Go back to
You learned about intermolecular forces in Chapter 3. Intermolecular

molecules and ions.
You know that some molecules are polar due to their asymmetrical
shapes. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one example of a polar molecule. These
molecules have a permanent dipole effect. This means that one end of
the molecule is more positive, and the other end is more negative.
Polar molecules attract ions and other polar molecules.
The partially positive end of one molecule is attracted to
the partially negative end of another molecule. This pattern
continues throughout the substance. These dipole-dipole
forces of attraction are not as strong as ionic bonds. Thus sub-
stances made up of polar molecules can exist as liquids and
gases. For example, ethanol (CH3;CH2,OH) is polar, and exists as
a liquid. You know this liquid as rubbing alcohol. Hydrogen
chloride (HCl) is also polar. It is a gas under normal conditions
as shown in Figure 11.5.
Attractions Between Non-Polar Molecules
What about substances made of non-polar molecules? You
GETICEEEY Dipole-dipole learned in Chapter 3 that weak dispersion forces form between
interactions between polar HCI non-polar molecules. As temporary dipoles form, they cause molecules to
molecules move closer together. However, these attractions are temporary and weak.
Thus, most small non-polar molecules do not hold together long enough
to maintain their solid or liquid forms. As a result, most small non-polar
molecules exist as gases at room temperature. For example, carbon diox-
ide (CO,) is a gas at normal temperatures.

Pentane has more sites along its length than methane does where tempo-

causes a change in state. When a solid is heated, it gains kinetic energy.
Eventually it will melt, and become a liquid. When you add kinetic
energy by heating a liquid, it will boil and become a gas. Earlier in this
section, you learned that gases move much more quickly than liquids or
solids. This is because gases have high kinetic energy.
Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases
The particle theory of matter does not discuss the kinetic energy of parti-
cles. Kinetic energy is important, however, when describing the unique
properties of gases.
The kinetic molecular theory of gases makes the following
assumptions:
e The volume of an individual gas molecule is negligible compared
to the volume of the container holding the gas. This means that
individual gas molecules, with virtually no volume of their own,
are extremely far apart and most of the container is “empty” space.
e There are neither attractive nor repulsive forces between gas
molecules,
e Gas molecules have high translational energy. They move randomly
in all directions, in straight lines. (See Figure 11.6, on page 423.)
e When gas molecules collide with each other or with a container
wall, the collisions are perfectly elastic. This means that when gas
molecules collide, somewhat like billiard balls, there is no loss of
kinetic energy.
e The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly related to
the temperature. The greater the temperature, the greater the
average motion of the molecules and the greater their average
kinetic energy.
The kinetic molecular theory describes a hypothetical gas called an
ideal gas. In an ideal gas, the gas particles take up hardly any space. Also,
the particles of an ideal gas do not attract each other.

Why Use the Kinetic Molecular Theory?
How and why did scientists formulate the kinetic molecular theory?
Experiments into gas behaviour demonstrate that, under normal tempera-
tures and pressures, nearly all gases behave in similar and predictable
ways. The properties and behaviours of real gases can be generalized into
a theory of an ideal gas. This generalization makes it possible for us to
calculate mathematically, with a high degree of accuracy, how real gases
will behave under varying conditions.
Of course, no gas is really “ideal.” The ideal gas theory ignores certain
facts about real gases. For example, an ideal gas particle does not take up
any space. In fact, you know that all particles of matter must take up
space. Gas particles are small and far apart, however. Thus the space
occupied by the particles is insignificant compared to the total volume
of the container. You will learn more about the behaviour of real gases
in Chapter 12.

\ y, From 1641 to 1642, Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) served as
Galileo’s secretary. He continued Galileo’s experiments and concluded
that the weight of air was pushing down on the rest of the water. The
weight of the air pushed water up the column. This was a logical conclu-
sion since gas molecules, like all matter on Earth, are pulled down by the
force of gravity.
Torricelli did further calculations involving the weight of the atmos-
phere pressing on the water. He then improved upon the experiment
by using mercury, which has a density 13.6 times greater than water.
He designed the apparatus which we now know as the barometer, shown
in Figure 11.10. Torricelli filled a glass tube of 1 cm diameter, closed at
one end, with mercury. He then inverted the tube in a dish of mercury.
Some of the mercury ran out of the tube. But about 760 mm of mercury
remained in the tube. This is about 13.6 times less than the height of
water that Galileo could pump. It is the air pushing on the mercury in the
dish that keeps this 760 mm of mercury in the tube.
Changes in Atmospheric Pressure
At first, Torricelli considered his experiment a failure. The height of the

mercury column did not remain constant at 760 mm, but changed slightly
as the weather and air temperature changed. As you learned in Grade 10,

these small changes in the height of the mercury column provide us with
valuable information. We can predict the weather, in part, by looking at
— glass changes in atmospheric pressure. For example, if the atmospheric pres-
760 mmHg tube sure decreases suddenly, a storm may be on the way.
Atmospheric pressure affects us in other ways, too. People who live at
high elevations, such as in the Rocky Mountains, have less mass of air
above them. At lower atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water
decreases. Because the water boils at a lower temperature, it takes longer
to cook food in boiling water on a mountain than at sea level.
The following ExpressLab demonstrates atmospheric pressure in a
dramatic way, showing you firsthand the tremendous pressure that the air
around us can exert.

The Relationship Between Pressure and Volume
Figure 11.11 shows a meteorologist preparing to release a weather balloon
partially filled with helium gas. As the balloon rises, atmospheric pressure
decreases. The volume of the balloon increases.
= — ———- 7
(GGETECRERED Weather balloons are partially inflated with helium. They carry
specialised instruments to measure varying atmospheric conditions such as pressure,
temperature, and humidity.
Since the helium atoms inside the balloon move randomly in all
directions, they constantly bombard all the area inside the walls of the
balloon, exerting a pressure. With decreasing atmospheric pressure, there
are fewer air molecules to collide with the outside of the balloon. As the
pressure outside the balloon becomes less than that inside the balloon,
the balloon expands. Given an expandable container, such as a balloon,
the volume occupied by the gas will increase when external pressure
decreases. As external pressure increases, gas molecules are forced closer
together. The volume of gas then decreases.

of the container. For all gases, V,,, = the volume of the container holding
the gas. (Do not confuse this with the molar volume of gases. You will
learn about molar volume in Chapter 12.)
Think about how the relationship between pressure and area for
solids would apply if you were testing a gas in a three-dimensional
container. You know that according to the kinetic molecular theory, gas
molecules exert pressure over the entire inside surface of their container.
If the volume of the container is halved, what would happen to the
pressure of the gas inside the container?
Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was an Irish scientist with an interest in
chemistry. He investigated the relationship between pressure and volume
of gases at constant temperatures. By making careful measurements of the
volume of a trapped gas, he was able to describe what happened when
the pressure exerted on the gas was increased. Figure 11.12 shows Boyle’s
experiment. Boyle measured the length of the column of trapped air
compared to the length of the column of mercury. Since the length of the
mercury column is directly related to its volume, Boyle was able to
deduce the relationship between pressure and volume.

Boyle's Law
In 1662, Robert Boyle stated that the volume ofa given amount ofgas, at
a constant temperature, varies inversely with the applied pressure. In
other words, as external pressure on a gas increases, the volume of the gas
decreases by the same factor. This statement is known as Boyle’s law.

Gas Temperature and Cryogenics
Some people wish to be frozen when they die,
trusting that future technologies will be able to
revive them. This untested process is called
cryonics. It was first suggested by Robert C.W.
Ettinger in 1962. Ettinger has since set up his
own Cryonics Institute in Michigan, where
people can have their bodies frozen and stored.
We still cannot freeze and re-animate higher
animals, such as people. Cryogenic freezing,
however, can suspend the life of tissues and
organs used for transplants. Cryogenics has

The Kelvin Scale and Absolute Zero
Charles found that, regardless of the gas tested,
the x-intercept on a graph would always be
—273°C. In 1848, Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), a
Scottish scientist, realised the significance of
this finding. He reasoned that at —-273°C, molec-
ular motion would cease. At this temperature,
kinetic energy would be zero. The volume of
a gas would, hypothetically, also be zero.
Of course, real gas molecules do have
volume. Also, at low temperatures all gases
will condense and change state. Still, Kelvin

There are no degree signs used in the Kelvin scale. More importantly,
there are no negative values. What would happen if you tried to calculate
a temperature twice as warm as —5°C? Mathematically, the answer would
be -10°C, but this is a colder temperature. When mathematical manipula-
tions are involved in studying gas behaviour, you need to convert degree
Celsius temperatures into kelvins. This is done using the relationship
Tx = °C + 273.15 or °C + 273
Most often, you will round off and use 273 as the conversion factor
relating K and °C.
Charles’ Law
Although Charles discovered that the volume of a fixed amount of gas
at constant pressure was proportional to its temperature, he never pub-
lished this finding. In 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850), a
French scientist, made reference to Charles’ work in a published paper.
The relationship between temperature and volume has since become
known as Charles’ law. Charles’ law states that the volume of a fixed
mass of gas is proportional to its temperature when the pressure is kept
constant.
As you can see from Figure 11.19 on page 442, the volume of a gas
increases or decreases by a fixed increment when subjected to a change in
temperature. The algebraic statement of Charles’ law depends on using

Gay-Lussac’s Law
Technology LINK
Aside from balloons and syringes, most containers that are used to store
gases have a fixed volume. You know that temperature is a measure of
the average kinetic energy of the molecules making up a substance. If the
temperature of a gas increases, but the volume of its container cannot
increase, what happens to the pressure of the gas inside?
Extending the work of Charles, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac discovered
the relationship between temperature and pressure acting on a fixed
volume of a gas. (Remember that for gases, V,,; = volume of container
holding the gas.) As you will learn later in this section, this relationship
is very important for the safe handling of gases under pressure in steel
tanks or aerosol cans. Gay-Lussac’s law states that the pressure of a fixed
amount of gas, at constant volume, is directly proportional to its Kelvin
temperature. (See Figure 11.20.)
Pat

Introducing a new proportionality constant (kz), this relationship can be
restated as
P=k.T or = =k,
If we assign P; and T; as the initial conditions, and P; and T; for the final
conditions, the above relationship can be rewritten as

Compressed Gases and Safety Concerns
The Gay-Lussac’s law Sample Problem in this section indicates how care-
fully gases under pressure must be handled. Chlorine gas can cause seri-
ous respiratory problems and irritate the skin and mucous membranes. In
extreme cases, death from suffocation could result from exposure to this
gas. Yet chlorine is an important industrial product. Compounds of chlo-
rine are used in bleaches, oxidizing agents, and solvents, and as interme-
diates in the manufacture of other substances.
Compressed gases are commonly stored in thick-walled
metal cylinders designed especially for this purpose. All
cylinders must comply with Canadian Transport Commission
(CTC) regulations. Containers must be permanently marked with
a serial number and specifications for the volume of the cylinder
and the maximum pressure it can withstand. Containers must be
tested every five to ten years, with the date of the test stamped
on the cylinder.
Figure 11.22 on the next page shows a typical compressed
gas cylinder. You can see that it is built to withstand high
pressures. There are other safety precautions as well, however.
Most cylinders used to store gases have safety devices
regulating the internal gas pressure. The most common of these
is a pressure relief valve. If the pressure inside the cylinder
increases to a dangerous level, a spring allows the valve to open
and release excess gas until the internal pressure returns to a
safe level. Some pressure relief valves will close once excess

450 MHR-« Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry
Cylinders used to store gases such as acetylene (C2Hz2), that
could cause an explosive chemical reaction at high tempera-
tures, are fitted with fusible plugs. These plugs are designed to
melt and allow gas to escape at temperatures lower than those at
which hazardous reactions can start. Fusible plugs for acetylene
cylinders are made of a metal alloy that melts at 100°C.
Not all compressed gas cylinders are fitted with pressure-
relief valves or fusible plugs. Cylinders containing toxic gases
such as chlorine or phosgene (COC],) are one example. These
gases could cause serious harm to health if released into the
air in sufficient quantities. Therefore, these gases, like all
compressed gases, must be handled with great care. They
must be stored in a well-ventilated, dry area. The surrounding
storage area must be fire-resistant, and proper fire-fighting
equipment must be immediately available. Gas cylinders should
never be stored near electrical circuits that might spark or near
other ignition sources such as open flames. Material Data Safety
Sheets must be available, and all cylinders must
be clearly labelled with WHMIS warning signs.

The Combined Gas Law
Boyle’s law can be used to solve for changes in volume when pressure
changes. The gas must be in a closed system and the temperature must
remain constant. You can use Charles’ law to solve for changes in volume
with temperature changes. This law works only in a closed system in
which pressure remains constant. Gay-Lussac’s law can solve problems in
which the amount and volume of gas remain constant while the tempera-
ture and pressure change.
As you learned, Boyle’s law (V a 1/P) is expressed mathematically
as PV = k. Charles’ law (V © T) is expressed mathematically as V/T = k,
when temperature is recorded in kelvins. Combining these two
expressions gives:
1 T
Va p * T or Va Pp
Introducing a new proportionality constant (k;), we can write
V= i x ks or PV = ks

This mathematical relationship is the combined gas law.
If a sample of a gas is trapped at a measured set of initial conditions,
the combined gas law can be rewritten as
PiVi _ 5

As this gas is then subjected to changes in pressure and temperature,
the final condition of the gas can be described mathematically as

Gases and Natural Phenomena
Gases under pressure are responsible for natural phenomena such as
volcanoes and geysers. On March 20, 1980, residents in the northern part
of Washington state heard a rumble from the mountains. They were told it
was only a minor earthquake. By March 27, seismologists were sure that
something more was involved. Deep inside one of the mountains, Earth’s
crust was moving. The lower portion of the crust was melting into hot
liquid called magma. The magma started rising up through cracks in the
crust. Trapped water quickly turned into superheated steam. Trapped
gases added to the increasing pressure inside the mountain. Then, on
May 18, 1980, the top half of Mount St. Helens blew away in a gigantic
explosion. It released all of the built-up pressure, along with many tonnes
of rock and ash, twenty kilometres into the atmosphere. It also released
steam, and gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide.
(See Figure 11.24.)
GPTISEE2P3 Before a volcano
erupts, there is a tremendous
build-up of fluid and gas
pressures inside the volcano due
to magma, steam, and gases.
Other gases released in volcanic explosions include the oxides, sulfides,
and chlorides of carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine. These
include CO,, CO, SQ2, SO3, Hz, H2S, Cle, HCl, and Fy». It is estimated that
the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991 released
about 1.8 x 107° kg of gases and ash into the atmosphere.
After a volcanic blast, or in an area of volcanic activity, geysers may
form. Cool water from Earth’s surface trickles down between rocks. It
drains deep into Earth’s crust, into regions where hot magmais still
present. As the water is heated, it forms steam. The steam rises back up
though fissures and cracks, meeting more water and heating it up as well.
More and more boiling water accumulates, until suddenly, through a
narrow opening, the pressurized hot water is violently ejected. As the

The English scientist John Dalton did a very thorough analysis of the o ai f r 1 p 0 r 1 e . s 3 s u k r P e a p of r e w s a s t u e r r e
atmosphere. He concluded that it comprised about 79% nitrogen and 21%
oxygen. (See Table 11.2 to find out how close he really was.) Dalton noticed
that the water vapour, however, seemed quite variable, so he did further
column of Hg
experiments. He obtained some very dry air, and measured the pressure 760 mm high
in the container. He then introduced some water vapour. The pressure
increased! Dalton repeated and adjusted his experiment time after time,
always with the same results. He concluded that the total pressure of a
mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures of each of the individual gases.
This is called Dalton’s Law of partial pressures. (See Figure 11.27 below.)

Dalton extended this idea to enhance what he had discovered about the

then he concluded that the nitrogen itself must be contributing

In certain situations, normal human respiratory functions are disrupted.
Hospitals use compressed oxygen for patients with respiratory disorders
such as emphysema, pneumonia, or lung cancer.
You may have heard of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chambers being used
to treat sports injuries. A high oxygen concentration in the blood causes
blood vessels to constrict. This lowers the swelling that can occur in
injured tissues. How is this high oxygen content delivered to the blood?
In an HBO chamber such as that shown in Figure 11.28, air is compressed
to three times normal atmospheric pressure. The patient breathes pure
oxygen (Ozig)) through a mask. The highly compressed air forces Ogi) in
the lungs into the blood. This increases of dissolved Oxi) in the blood-

Oxygen at High Altitudes
At other times, respiratory functions may be normal, but the environment
poses problems. Commercial jet planes fly at an altitude of around 9.5 km.
Airplanes carry pressurized oxygen for their passengers to breathe as they
fly at high altitudes. Mountain climbers also need compressed oxygen
when climbing to great heights. Those exploring ocean depths need oxy-

Nitrogen’s Many Uses
Inert gases are not very reactive. The word inert is also a synonym for
sluggish and slow. Something with the property of inertness hardly
sounds useful! Yet this very property makes nitrogen extremely valuable
in technological and industrial applications.
Because nitrogen gas reacts with very few substances, it can be used
to blanket substances, preventing them from reacting with oxygen. (A
reaction with oxygen is called oxidation.) Blanketing means covering
something with nitrogen, displacing all of the oxygen. This usually hap-
pens in a closed container. For example, ground coffee can taste bitter
when exposed to oxygen for long periods of time. Packaging coffee in a
nitrogen-enhanced container helps coffee keep its flavour. Gaseous nitro-
gen is also used for the long-term storage of fruits such as apples, allowing
us to enjoy a wide variety of produce out of season.
Liquid nitrogen’s low boiling point (77 K) means that it can be used in
food preservation. Foods frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen retain more
nutrients than slowly frozen foods. Less damage is done to cell structure
during the quick-freezing process. Freezing foods this way also removes
moisture, decreasing their weight and size. Freeze-dried foods are often
used by people who require easily portable, lightweight food, such as
campers, the military, and space explorers.
In cryosurgery, liquid nitrogen is used to fast-freeze cancerous tissues
and warts. This proven new technique kills the cancerous area and allows
surgeons to safely remove the dead tissue.
Gases and Undersea Exploration
Throughout history, humans have tried to explore the little-known world
of the deep seas. Even with modern diving gear, the deep oceans are a
dangerous place for humans. The air that a diver breathes to stay alive
underwater can itself be one of the greatest hazards. That’s because of the
tremendous pressure exerted by the waters above a diver. For roughly
every 10 metres of depth, water pressure on the diver’s body adds the
equivalent of one unit of atmospheric pressure (Figure 11.31).
The air that a diver breathes (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) must equal
the pressure of the surrounding water if the diver’s lungs are to stay
inflated. Of course, this gas pressure increases as a diver goes deeper.
As the gas pressure increases, the diver’s bloodstream and body tissues
absorb higher and higher volumes of gases.
Beyond depths of roughly 40-60 metres,
the increased volumes of gas in the diver’s body
can cause nitrogen narcosis. When nitrogen
narcosis strikes, normal feelings become danger-
ously exaggerated. A diver may experience a
blissful giddiness, along with disorientation and
impaired judgement. This condition is called
“rapture of the deep.” Divers in this state
have been known to remove their breathing
apparatus to swim like fish, mistake up for
down, or simply lose track of how long they
have been underwater.
At the other extreme, a diver’s normal sense
of caution may degenerate into irrational fear or (GEPESEREES] At 50 m underwater, a diver experiences pressure

worst thing—rush to the surface without pausing to decompress on the
way up. Why is this dangerous?
The dissolved gases such as nitrogen in the diver’s bloodstream are
under pressure. This is much like the carbon dioxide that is dissolved in a
can of soda. If the diver returns to the surface too quickly, these dissolved
gases behave similarly to the gas in soda when a can is opened. The gases
escape from the blood as bubbles in the diver’s blood vessels. These bub-
bles can block the flow of blood. They produce a painful and potentially
fatal condition called “the bends.”
Both nitrogen narcosis and the bends make prolonged deep diving a
risky business. They limit both the safe depth and safe duration of human
diving. Even skilled professional divers rarely descend beyond about
50 metres. Also, they rarely remain at that depth for much more than
30 minutes.

The Molar Volume of Gases
Gay-Lussac measured the volumes of gases before and after a reaction.
His research led him to devise the law of combining volumes: When gases
react, the volumes of the reactants and the products, measured at equal
temperatures and pressures, are always in whole number ratios. For
example, 2 volumes of hydrogen gas react with 1 volume of oxygen gas
to produce 2 volumes of water vapour.

volume of an ideal gas. Scientists have decided that 22.4 L/mol is an

ideal gas.
e Collisions are completely elastic and, thus, do not use up energy.
These characteristics led to the ideal gas law. They are accurate enough
for most applications. They are not perfect, however. In fact, most gases
fall short of these characteristics in many ways:
e The particles of a real gas have a significant volume of their own.
e Molecules do attract each other.
e Molecules do not necessarily move in straight lines.
e Collisions are not completely elastic.
At high pressures and/or low temperatures, gases have smaller volumes.
This means that the gas molecules are closer together. Since they are
closer together, the molecules interact more than when they are far apart.
It is no longer true to say that the molecules have no attractive forces
between each other or with their container. Part A of Figure 12.8 illus-
trates how this affects the pressure of a gas. Also, since the total volume
is smaller, the amount of space taken up by the gas molecules is more
important. You can no longer ignore the volume of the gas molecules.
Part B of Figure 12.8 illustrates that gas molecules do occupy part of the
volume of the container.
(A) Because parti-
cles are attracted to each other,
the pressure is reduced. (B) Since
particles take up space, the total
volume of empty space is smaller
than the volume of the container.
Scientists who want more accuracy in their experiments have adapted
the ideal gas law to reflect the behaviour of real gases. In later chemistry
courses, you will learn more about this corrected version of the ideal gas
law, called the Van der Waals equation.
To summarize, at low pressures and high temperatures, most gases
behave as ideal gases. Under any conditions that allow attractive forces
between molecules to occur, gases no longer behave as an ideal gas. They
behave as real gases.

e Always convert the temperature to kelvins (K).
e Always convert the masses to moles (mol).
e Always convert the volumes to litres (L).
e Using the ideal gas law will be easier if you always convert the

of R (8.314 wat) and use it for every calculation. If you happen to
forget the value of R, you can calculate it by finding R for 1 mol of
gas at STP.

For N.O, the molar mass is
2N = 2 x 14.01 g/mol
10 = 1 x 16.00 g/mol
Mn,0 = 44.02 g/mol
For 2.53 mol, the mass (m) is
m=nxM
= 2.53 metx 44.02 g/met
=111g
Therefore, 111 g of laughing gas is in the cylinder.

In this section, you learned that the ideal gas law was derived from
Avogadro’s law and the combined gas law. You can use the ideal gas law
to calculate the pressure, temperature, volume, or number of moles of
a gas. In the next section, you will learn how to apply the ideal gas law
to identify unknown gases on the basis of their densities and/or molar
masses.

As geologists study the area where an ancient marsh was located,

The percentage composition of the gas is 80.0% carbon
and 20.0% hydrogen.
Plan Your Strategy
Step1 Find the empirical formula of the gas, using the molar masses
of carbon and hydrogen and the percent compositions.
Step2 Solve the ideal gas law for the number of moles. First change
the temperature to kelvins. Then change the pressure to
kilopascals and use R = 8.314 kPa-L/mol-K. (You could also
use R = 0.08206 atm-L/mol-K.)
Step3 Find the molar mass (M) of the compound by dividing the
mass of the sample (m) by the number of moles (n) in the
sample.
Step 4 Compare the molar mass of the unknown gas with the molar
mass of the empirical formula. To find the molecular formula,
multiply the empirical formula by the ratio of the two molar
masses.
Act on Your Strategy
Step1 Find the empirical formula. Assume that the total mass of the
sample is 100.0 g. Thus the mass of the carbon in the sample
is 80.0% x 100.0 g = 80.0 g. The mass of the hydrogen is
20.0% x 100.0 g = 20.0.

recall, the term “stoichiometry” refers to the relationship between the
number of moles of the reactants and the number of moles of the products
in a chemical reaction. In this section, you will learn how to use
Gay-Lussac’s law of combining volumes and the ideal gas law to solve
stoichiometric problems that involve gases.

same temperature and pressure.
(a) What volume of ammonia gas is produced?

What Is Required?
(a) Calculate the volume of ammonia gas produced when 12.0 L of
nitrogen gas reacts.
(b) Calculate the volume of hydrogen gas used up by the reaction.

You know that the mole ratios of the volumes of gases are the same
as the ratios of the volumes. Therefore, you can use the mole ratios
to find the volumes of ammonia gas and hydrogen gas. You do not
need to use the temperature and pressure, since they remain the
same in this problem.

Solving Gas Stoichiometry Problems
Earlier in this course, you learned how to do stoichiometry calculations.
To solve gas stoichiometry problems, you will incorporate the ideal gas
law into what you learned previously. The following steps will help you
do this.
How to Solve Gas Stoichiometry Problems
1. Write a balanced equation for the reaction.
2. Write the given information under the appropriate reactants and
products. Put a question mark under the reactant or product for
which information is needed.
3. Convert all amounts to moles.
4. Compare molar amounts using stoichiometry ratios from the
balanced equation. Solve for the unknown molar amount.
5. Convert the new molar amount into the units required. You may
multiply by a conversion factor, or use a set of conditions with
the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.
Using the Ideal Gas Law for the Gaseous Product of a Reaction
The best way to find out how to do a stoichiometry problem using the
ideal gas law is to study an example. In the following Sample Problem,
you will use a balanced equation and the ideal gas law to find the volume
of a gas produced. (Refer to Chapter 4, section 4.1, if you want to review
how to write balanced equations.)

along with the mole ratios from the balanced equation, to

Including Water Vapour Pressure in Gas Calculations
You can collect many gases by allowing them to bubble up
through water into a container that is filled with water. (See
Figure 12.16). This is the method your teacher used to collect
the gas in Investigation 12-A. Unfortunately, molecules of water
vapour mix with the gas sample. To avoid error, the pressure that
was contributed by the water vapour must be subtracted when
finding the pressure of the gas.
As an example, consider hydrogen gas, which is often
collected over water. The hydrogen that is collected is a mixture
of hydrogen and water vapour. As you learned from Dalton’s law
of partial pressures in Chapter 11, the pressure of this mixture is
Protal = Phydrogen + Pwater vapour
To find the partial pressure of dry hydrogen, subtract the pressure
of the water vapour from the total pressure. GETIEEPATS This is an
efficient and convenient method
Ph drogen — Protal _ Pwater vapour
ees P for collecting hydrogen gas.
The pressure of the water vapour is the same for any gas that is collected Unfortunately molecules of water
at a particular temperature. For example, the pressure of water vapour at vapour mix with the gas sample.
25°C is 3.17 kPa. Table 12.3 gives the pressure of water vapour at different
temperatures.
When using the ideal gas law for a gas collected over water, you
must correct the pressure before you substitute it into the gas law. The

Using the Ideal Gas Law for the Gaseous Reactant of a Reaction

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you learned how to use Gay-Lussac’s law to calculate vol-
umes of gases in a gas reaction. You also learned how to use the ideal gas
law to find the volumes of gases used or produced in reactions. Building
on Dalton’s law of partial pressures, from Chapter 11, you learned how
to calculate the molar volume of a gas collected over water. Finally, you
learned, first-hand, how to produce hydrogen gas in a laboratory.
In the next section, you will see how gases in the atmosphere inter-
act with the Sun’s light. You will also find out about the dangers of gas

These campers are enjoying the environment, but they are harming it at
the same time. How?
Fortunately many people are now aware of issues such as pollution
from car exhaust and ozone depletion. At the same time, Canadian chemi-
cal and related industries employ about 250 000 people and generate tens
of billions of dollars annually. These industries make the products that
entertain, feed, clothe, and keep Canadians comfortable. When discussing
atmospheric chemistry and pollution, we must consider two important
influences: the economy and the environment.
In this section, you will look at the chemistry that takes place among
the gases in the atmosphere. You will examine an important gas called
ozone and the pollutants that affect this gas.
Gas Chemistry in the Atmosphere
Many important chemical reactions take place in the atmosphere. All
these reactions involve gases. There are two main types of gas chemistry
in the atmosphere:
e interactions between gases already present in the atmosphere
e interactions between atmospheric gases and gases produced by
processes on Earth
Chapter 12 Exploring Gas Laws» MHR_ 515
The Ozone Cycle
High in the atmosphere, a gas called ozone, O3, absorbs ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from the Sun. The radiation separates the ozone into oxygen gas,
O,, and an oxygen atom. After passing through a few more steps, ozone
is re-formed when molecules of oxygen gas combine with oxygen atoms.
By absorbing energy from the Sun in this way, ozone prevents harmful
UV radiation from reaching Earth’s surface. Figure 12.19 illustrates the
cycle that occurs as ozone is formed, absorbs UV radiation, and breaks up.
Figure 12.20 shows where ozone is located in the atmosphere.

GEMISEEAEY The ozone cycle: (A) Oxygen gas in the atmosphere absorbs energy from
the Sun. Each oxygen molecule breaks up into two oxygen atoms. (B) An oxygen atom
combines with a molecule of oxygen gas to form ozone. Another molecule is needed to
absorb extra energy. (C) Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and breaks up again into
oxygen gas and an oxygen atom.
Pollutants in the Atmosphere
Gases from living and non-living processes on Earth’s surface interact
with the gases in the atmosphere. For example, oxygen and carbon diox-
ide in the air are involved in animal and plant respiration. A forest fire
burns plants to produce carbon dioxide gas. On a more damaging level,
human technology and industrial processes produce many polluting
gases. As you will learn in Chapter 14, burning fossil fuels is a major
source of gas pollution in the atmosphere.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are an important class of polluting gases
that are not usually caused by burning fossil fuels. CFCs are stable and
harmless near the ground. When they make their way up into the atmos-
phere, however, they interact and interfere with atmospheric processes. In
particular, these gases interfere with the production and reactions of
ozone, O03. You will learn more about CFCs later in this section.

pollutants.
(See Figure 12.21.)
516 MHR-« Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry
At this level, ozone is a pollutant with a harsh odour. In humans and
animals, it causes respiratory problems, including coughing, wheezing,
and eye irritation. It retards plant growth, reduces the productivity of
crops, and damages forests. Concentrations of ozone as low as 0.1 ppm
(parts per million) can decrease photosynthesis by 50%. In addition, it
damages plastics, breaks down rubber, and corrodes metals.

to enter the atmosphere and prevent it from
leaving again. This is called the greenhouse
effect. Thanks to the greenhouse effect, Earth
remains fairly warm, with an average tempera-
ture of about 15.5°C. Without this effect, Earth’s
temperature would be about —18°C.
Human activities over the last hundred
years have caused the level of carbon dioxide
and other gases in the atmosphere to increase.
As a result, more heat is trapped in Earth’s
atmosphere. According to Environment Canada,
Canada’s average temperature has risen by about
1°C over the last century. This is causing more

CFCs and Ozone Depletion
As you learned earlier, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that
interfere with the ozone cycle high up in the atmosphere. CFCs are non-
toxic, nonflammable compounds that contain atoms of chlorine, carbon,
and fluorine. These gases are human-made compounds that were released
into the atmosphere primarily from refrigeration and aerosol devices.
In 1928, Thomas Midgley invented the first CFC compound. Because
they were useful but safe, they were referred to as “miracle compounds.”
In particular, dichlorodifluoromethane, CCl,.F2, also known as Freon, was
discovered to be an efficient refrigerant.
Chapter 12 Exploring Gas Laws» MHR_ 517
Because of Freon, household refrigeration became common. In fact, much
of our modern-day life style first became possible because of CFCs.
By 1974, millions of tonnes of CFCs had been produced (see Figure 12.22).
At the University of California, chemists F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario
Molina began to wonder where all of these CFCs ended up. They realized
that CFCs are chemically very stable. However, they began to calculate
what happens when CFCs are exposed to high levels of radiation far up in
the atmosphere. As it turned out, their fears were well-founded. In 1985,
British scientists in the Antarctic noticed a large decrease in the ozone
layer above the Antarctic. A “hole” in the ozone layer was beginning to
form. In 1995, Rowland and Molina, along with a third ozone scientist,
won the Nobel Prize for their work with CFCs.
How CFCs Attack Ozone

ultraviolet radiation to produce chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms

illustrates this process for the CFC trichlorofluoromethane, CCI3F.
Eventually the chlorine atom reacts with a different compound in the
atmosphere to form a stable, less harmful product.

GETIEREZ=] The breakdown of a CFC by ultraviolet radiation produces single chlorine
atoms that attack and destroy ozone. Because the chlorine atoms are released, they
attack ozone again and again in a chain reaction.
Although they are the most abundant ozone-depleting substance, CFCs
are not the only culprits. Other chemicals that damage the ozone layer
include methyl bromide, CH3Br, carbon tetrachloride, CCl,, and halons
such as carbon trifluorobromide, CF3Br.
518 MHR- Unit 4 Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry
The Effects of Ozone Depletion
How do we know that CFCs and other ozone-destroying
molecules are having an effect on the atmosphere? As
Figure 12.24 illustrates, ozone levels over Canada and
other parts of the world have decreased significantly
since the late 1970s.
With reduced ozone levels, more ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun reaches Earth. Among
humans, UV-induced skin cancer and eye damage
are becoming a serious threat. The increased levels
of radiation also damage phytoplankton in fresh
and marine ecosystems. Since phytoplankton are
the base of the aquatic food chain, this damage
affects all other water species. As you learned
earlier, the presence of ozone close to Earth damages
crops and forests. A lack of ozone in the atmosphere,
however, also reduces the yield of crops, such as barley
and canola, and harms forests.

in North America have air conditioners that contain ozone-friendly
refrigerants. Used CFCs from older refrigeration units are being recycled
so that they do not escape into the atmosphere. A lot has already been
accomplished, but more remains to be done.
Much of the positive activity comes from an international agreement
called the Montréal Protocol. This agreement was signed in Montréal,
Canada, on September 16, 1987. It has been successful in drastically
reducing the use of CFCs worldwide. The Montréal Protocol is particular-
ly significant because, for the first time, individual countries put a
common planetary goal ahead of their own economic interests.
The Montréal Protocol stated that the production and consumption ud
of all substances that deplete the ozone layer would be phased out by the aM
year 2000 in developed countries. (Methyl chloroform would be phased

During the mid-1850s, chemists synthesized other organic
compounds, such as methane and ethanol, from inorganic chemicals.
Eventually chemists abandoned their vital-force ideas. We still use the
terms “organic” and “inorganic,” however, to distinguish carbon-based
compounds from other compounds. For example, sugar is an organic
compound since it is carbon based. Salt is inorganic since it contains
no carbon.
During the last century, the number of synthetic (human-made)
organic compounds has skyrocketed. Chemists invent more than 250 000
new synthetic organic chemicals each year. With almost endless varia-
tions in properties, chemists can synthesize organic compounds to make
products as diverse as life-giving drugs, and toys. Nearly all medicines,
such as painkillers, cough syrups, and antidepressants, are based on
organic compounds. Perfumes, food flavourings, materials such as rubber
and plastic, and fabrics such as nylon, rayon, and polyester are all organic
compounds as well.

oil, and natural gas—that society depends on today. (See Figure 13.2.)

Properties of Alkanes
Alkanes (and all other aliphatic compounds) have an important physical
property. They are non-polar. As you know from Chapter 8, non-polar
molecules have fairly weak intermolecular forces. As a result, hydrocar-
bons such as alkanes have relatively low boiling points. As the number
of atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule increases, the boiling point
increases. Because of this, alkanes exist in a range of states under
standard conditions.

Table 13.1 compares the sizes (number of atoms per molecule) and boil-

Naming Alkanes
The IUPAC system for naming organic compounds is very logical and
thorough. The rules for naming alkanes are the basis for naming the other
organic compounds that you will study. Therefore it is important that you
understand how to name alkanes.
Naming Straight-Chain Alkanes
Recall that carbon can bond to form long, continuous, chain-like struc-
tures. Alkanes that bond in this way are called straight-chain alkanes.
(They are also called unbranched alkanes.) Straight-chain alkanes are
the simplest alkanes. Table 13.2 lists the names of the first ten straight-
chain alkanes.
Table 13.2 The First Ten Straight-Chain Alkanes
Name | Number of carbon atoms | Expanded molecular formula
methane 1 CH,
ethane 2 CH;3CH3
propane 3 CH3CH,CH,;
butane 4 CH;(CH2)2CH;
pentane 5 CH3(CH2)3CHs

heptane 7 CH3(CH2);CHs3
octane 8 CH3(CH2)g¢CH3
nonane 9 CH3(CH2)7CH3
decane 10 CH3(CH2)sCH3
The root of each name (highlighted in colour) serves an important
function. It tells you the number of carbon atoms in the chain. The
suffix -ane tells you that these compounds are alkane hydrocarbons.
Thus the root and the suffix of one of these simple names provide the
complete structural story of the compound.

Notice four important facts about 2-methylpentane:
1. Its structure is different from the structure of a straight-chain alkane.
Like many hydrocarbons, this isomer of CgH,,4 has a branch-like
structure. Alkanes such as 2-methylpentane are called branched-chain
alkanes. (The branch is sometimes called a side-chain.)
2. The name of this alkane has a prefix (2-methyl-) as well as a root
and a suffix. Many of the hydrocarbons you will name from now on
have a prefix.
3. This alkane has a single CH3 unit that branches off from the main
(parent) chain of the compound.

Drawing Alkanes
As you learned earlier in this chapter, three kinds of diagrams can be used
to represent the structure of a hydrocarbon. The easiest kind is probably
the condensed structural diagram. When you are asked to draw a con-
densed structural diagram for an alkane, such as 2,3-dimethylhexane,
you can follow several simple rules. These rules are listed below. After
you have studied the rules, use the Practice Problems to practise your
alkane-drawing skills.

Alkenes
Did you know that bananas are green when they are picked? How do they
become yellow and sweet by the time they reach your grocer’s produce
shelf or your kitchen? Food retailers rely on a hydrocarbon to make the
transformation from bitter green fruit to delicious ripe fruit. The hydrocar-
bon is ethene. It is the simplest member of the second group of aliphatic
compounds: the alkenes.
Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds.
Like alkanes, alkenes can form continuous chain and branched-chain
structures. They also form a homologous series. As well, they are non-
polar, which gives them physical properties similar to those of alkanes.
Alkenes are different from alkanes, however, in a number of ways.
First, their bonds are different, as indicated by their suffixes. As you
will recall, the -ane ending tells you that alkane compounds are joined by
single bonds. The -ene ending for alkenes tells you that these compounds
have one or more double bonds. A double bond involves four bonding
electrons between two carbon atoms, instead of the two bonding electrons
in all alkane bonds. Examine Figure 13.18 to see how the presence of a
double bond affects the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkene.

552 MHR« Unit 5 Hydrocarbons and Energy
The general formula for an alkene is C,H2,. You can check this against
the next two members of the alkene series. Propene has three carbon
atoms, so you would expect it to have six hydrogens. Butene has four car-
bon atoms, so it should have eight hydrogens. The formulas for propene
and butene are C3Hg and C4Hs, so the general formula is accurate. Note,
however, that the general formula applies only if there is one double bond
per molecule. You will learn about alkenes with multiple double bonds in
future chemistry courses.
Properties of Alkenes
The general formula for alkenes implies that at least two carbon atoms
in any alkene compound have fewer than four bonded atoms. As a result,
chemists refer to alkenes as unsaturated compounds. Unlike saturated
compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbons contain carbon atoms that can
potentially bond to additional atoms. = -,
Unsaturated compounds have physical and chemical properties that
GETIEEERE) Plastics made
differ from those of saturated compounds. For example, the boiling points
from ethene
of alkenes are usually slightly less than the boiling points of similar-sized
alkanes (alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms). This difference
reflects the fact that the forces between molecules are slightly less for
alkenes than for alkanes. For example, the boiling point of ethane is
—89°C, whereas the boiling point of ethene is —104°C. On the other hand,
both alkenes and alkanes have a low solubility in water. Alkenes, like all
aliphatic compounds, are non-polar.
The double bond in alkenes has important consequences for their
chemical properties. Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes. For
example, alkenes react with halogens in the absence of light, but alkanes If you have access to probe-

food pouches, milk bottles, motor oil bottles, many toys, shrink-wrap, and
plastic bags are all based on the small ethene molecule. (See Figure 13.19.)
The ethene in these products undergoes a process called polymerization.
In polymerization, hundreds of ethene molecules are reacted and strung
together to make long chains of molecules. Another alkene, propene,
undergoes a similar process and thus increases the variety of possible
polymers.
On the previous page, you learned that ethene is used to ripen fruit.
How does this work? Whena fruit ripens, enzymes in the fruit begin to
produce ethene gas. The ethene is responsible for the colour change, as
well as the softening and sweetening that occur as the fruit ripens. Food
chemists have learned that they can suppress ethene production (and
delay ripening) by keeping fruits at a low temperature as they are
transported. Once the fruits reach their final destination, ethene can be
pumped into the fruit containers to hasten the ripening process. No
wonder you can get such a variety of fresh fruit at the supermarket!
In the next investigation, you will use reactivity to identify saturated
and unsaturated compounds in some everyday products. Saturated and
unsaturated compounds play an important part in healthy eating, as you
will discover.

Naming Alkenes
The names of alkenes follow the same format as the names of alkanes:
prefix + root + suffix. The prefixes and the steps for locating and identify-
ing branches are the same, too. The greatest difference involves the double
bond. The suffix -ene immediately tells you that a compound has at least
one double bond. The rest of the necessary information—the location of
the double bond, and the number of carbon atoms in the main chain—is
communicated in the root. Follow the steps below to find out how to
name the compound in Figure 13.20.

In 2-ethyl-1-butene, the double bond and the branch are near each other
on the carbon chain. What happens if the double bond is close to one end
of the carbon chain, but the branches are close to the other end? For
example, how would you name the compound in Figure 13.21?
CHs
The methyl branch is close to the right end of the main chain. The
double bond is close to the left end of the main chain. Therefore you CH; — CH= CH— CH— CH
need to follow the rule in step 2: the double bond has the lowest possible
position number. Now you can combine the name as follows:
e The 5-carbon main chain is numbered from the left. The double bond is
given the number 2 (because 2 is lower than 3). The root and the suffix
are -2-pentene.
e The prefix is 4-methyl- since there is a 1-carbon branch on the fourth
carbon of the main chain.
e The complete name is 4-methyl-2-pentene.
Although the compounds you have just named have different structural
formulas, they both have the same molecular formula: CsHi2. These
compounds are both isomers of CgHj2! You worked with structural iso-
mers earlier in this chapter. You have seen that isomers can be made by
rearranging carbon and hydrogen atoms and creating new branches. Now
you will learn that isomers can also be made by rearranging double bonds.

Alkynes
Carbon and hydrogen atoms can be arranged in many ways to produce a
great variety of compounds. Yet another way involves triple bonds in the
structure of compounds. This bond structure creates a class of aliphatic
compounds called alkynes. Alkynes are aliphatic compounds that contain
one or more triple bonds.
Naming and Drawing Alkynes
Both double and triple bonds are multiple bonds. Therefore alkynes are
unsaturated hydrocarbons, just as alkenes are. To name alkynes and draw
their structures, you follow the same rules that you used for alkenes. The
only difference is the suffix -yne, which you need to use when naming
alkyne compounds. Also, remember to count the number of bonds for
each carbon. An alkyne bond counts as three bonds.
As you might expect, the presence of a triple bond in alkynes makes
their physical and chemical properties different from those of alkanes and
CHs
alkenes. A structure with a triple bond must be linear around the bond.
(See Figure 13.24.) This means that the shapes of alkynes are different
from the shapes of alkanes and alkenes. As well, the triple bond makes

their basic structure centres on four rings of carbon atoms. In other words,
steroids are built around ring structures of alkanes and alkenes.
Hydrocarbon ring structures are called cyclic hydrocarbons. They
occur when the two ends of a hydrocarbon chain join together. In order to
do this, a hydrogen atom from each end carbon must be removed, just as
in the formation of a multiple bond. (See Figure 13.26 on the next page.)
Chapter 13 The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons * MHR 561
You should have no trouble recognizing cyclohexane as a member of
the alkane family. Notice, however, that cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexa-
ne, have two fewer hydrogen atoms compared with other alkanes. Thus
they have the general formula C,,H2,. (This is the same as the general for-
mula for alkenes.)
Naming and Drawing Cyclic Hydrocarbons
To draw the structure of a cyclic hydrocarbon, use a line diagram in a
ring-like shape, such as the one shown in Figure 13.26. Each carbon-
carbon bond is shown as a straight line. Each corner of the ring represents
a carbon atom. Hydrogen atoms are not shown, but they are assumed to be
present in the correct numbers.

Because of the ring structure, the naming rules for cyclic hydro-
carbons, including cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, are slightly different
from those for alkanes and alkenes. Below are four examples to illustrate
the naming rules.
To draw cyclic hydrocarbons, start with the rules you learned for
drawing other types of compounds. To place multiple bonds and branches,
you have the option of counting in either direction around the ring.
Naming Cyclic Hydrocarbons
Example 1: You can still use the general formula: prefix + root + suffix. In
Figure 13.27, there are only single carbon-carbon bonds. There are also five
corners (carbon atoms) in the ring, which is the main chain. Since there are
no branches, the name of this compound is cyclopentane. Notice the addi-
tion of cyclo- to indicate the ring structure.
Example 2: When naming cyclic compounds, all carbon atoms in the ring
CH3 are treated as equal. This means that any carbon can be carbon number 1.

carbon that the branch is attached to is carbon number 1. Because this
branch automatically gets the lowest possible position number, no position

Example 3: When two or more branches are on a ring structure, each must

have the lowest possible position number. Which way do you count the
carbons around the ring? You can count in either direction around the ring. In
Figure 13.29, a good choice is to make the ethy! branch carbon number 1 and
then count counterclockwise. This allows you to sequence the branches in CH, — CH;
alphabetical order and to add the position numbers in ascending order. So
the name of this structure is 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclohexane. | Figure 13.29 |
Example 4: In Figure 13.30, there is a double bond, represented by the
extra vertical line inside the ring structure. You must follow the same rules
as for alkenes. That is, the double bond gets priority for the lowest number.
This means that one of the carbon atoms, on either end of the double bond, CH;
must be carbon number 1. The carbon atom at the other end must be carbon
number 2. Next you have to decide in which direction to count so that the
branch gets the lowest possible position number. In this compound, the
carbon atom on the bottom end of the double bond is carbon number 1.
Then you can count clockwise so that the methyl! group on the top carbon | Figure 13.30 |
of the ring has position number 3. (Counting in the other direction would
give a higher locating number for the branch.) The name of this structure
is 3-methyl-1-cyclohexene.

cracking, reforming
(GETESREXZ] This oil refinery is in Clarkson, Ontario.
Reliance on hydrocarbons has increased substantially since the nineteenth
century. Our society now requires these compounds for fuel, as well as for
the raw materials that are used to synthesize petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals are basic hydrocarbons, such as ethene and propene, that
are converted into plastics and other synthetic materials. Petroleum is the
chief source of the petrochemicals that drive our cars and our economy.
Petroleum is not a pure substance, however. Rather, petroleum is a com-
plex mixture of hydrocarbons—mainly alkanes and alkenes—of varying
molecular sizes and states. Because petroleum is a mixture, its composi-
tion varies widely from region to region in the world. An efficient process
is essential for separating and collecting the individual, pure hydrocarbon
components. Read on to learn about this process in greater detail.

Perforated plates, which are fitted with bubble caps, are placed at various
levels in the tower. As each fraction reaches a plate where the temperature
is just below its boiling point, it condenses and liquefies. The liquid
fractions are taken from the tower by pipes. Other fractions that are still
vapours continue to pass up through the plates to higher levels.
Several plates are needed to collect each fraction. Heavier hydro-
carbons (larger molecules) have higher boiling points. They condense first
and are removed in the lower sections of the tower. The lighter hydrocar-
bons, with lower boiling points, reach the higher levels of the tower
before they are separated.

Cracking and Reforming
Once the fractions are removed from the distillation tower, they may
be chemically processed or purified further to make them marketable.
(See Figure 13.36.) There has been a tremendous increase in the demand
for a variety of petroleum products in the early twentieth century. This
demand has forced the oil industry to develop new techniques to increase
the yield from each barrel of oil. These techniques are called cracking and
reforming.

Cracking was first introduced in Sarnia, Ontario. This process uses heat to
break larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller gasoline molecules.
Cracking is done in the absence of air and can produce different types of
hydrocarbons. For example, the cracking of propane can produce methane
and ethene, as well as propene and hydrogen. (See Figure 13.37.)

Fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum) are fuels that are Products
made from fossilized organic materials. The trapped energy from the Sun
is still present in fossil fuels. To use this energy, we need to extract it.
Combustion, or burning, is the most common way to extract energy from
fossil fuels.
In this chapter, you will explore the ways in which our society obtains
energy from fossil fuels. You will get a chance to measure exactly how
much energy is obtained from an organic substance by doing your own

Complete and Incomplete Combustion
During a typical combustion reaction, an element or a compound reacts
with oxygen to produce oxides of the element (or elements) found in the
compound. Figure 14.2 shows an example of a combustion reactions.
Hydrocarbon compounds will burn in the presence of air to produce
oxides. This is a chemical property of all hydrocarbons. Complete
combustion occurs if enough oxygen is present. A hydrocarbon that
undergoes complete combustion produces carbon dioxide and water
vapour. The following equation shows the complete combustion of
propane. (See also Figure 14.3.)

combustion to occur. Complete combustion ensures that you are getting

type of pollution.
Go back to the equation for the complete combustion of propane. Notice
that the mole ratio of oxygen to propane for the complete combustion
(5 mol oxygen to 1 mol propane) is higher than the mole ratio for the
incomplete combustion (7 mol oxygen to 2 mol propane, or 3.5 mol oxy-
gen to 1 mol propane). These ratios show that the complete combustion
of propane used up more oxygen than the incomplete combustion. In
fact, the incomplete combustion probably occurred because not enough
oxygen was present. You just learned that incomplete combustion pro-
duces poisonous carbon monoxide. This is why you should never operate
a gas barbecue or gas heater indoors, where there is less oxygen available.
This is also why you should make sure that any natural gas or oil-burning
furnaces and appliances in your home are working at peak efficiency, to
reduce the risk of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide detectors are
a good safeguard. They warn you if there is dangerous carbon monoxide
in your home, due to incomplete combustion.

How do you write the balanced equation for the complete combustion of
acetylene (ethyne)? Complete hydrocarbon combustion reactions follow a
general format:
hydrocarbon + oxygen — carbon dioxide + water vapour
You can use this general format for the complete combustion of any
hydrocarbon, no matter how large or how small. For example, both
acetylene and propane burn completely to give carbon dioxide and water
vapour. Each hydrocarbon, however, produces different amounts, or mole
ratios, of carbon dioxide and water.
You have seen, written, and balanced several types of reaction
equations so far in this textbook. In the following sample problem, you
will learn an easy way to write and balance hydrocarbon combustion
equations.

You need to write the equation. Then you need to balance the atoms

exothermic reactions because they produce heat. Since the energy is a

Suppose that you are very thirsty, but the tap water is not cold enough.
How can you get the water as cold as you want it to be? Your experience tells you to add
ice to the water. How does the ice cool the water?
Any time that something is cooled or heated, a change in thermal energy
occurs. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of particles of matter. In a
glass of tap water with ice (as shown in Figure 14.9), the water started out
warmer than the ice. Energy was transferred from the water to the ice. As
the ice absorbed the energy, the ice melted. As the water lost energy, the
water cooled.
These examples involve heat. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy

Two students performed an experiment to

when determining the quantity of thermal energy
lost or gained by a substance undergoing an
energy change. They set up their experiment
as follows.
Part A
The students placed two different masses of
water, at the same initial temperature, in separate
beakers. They placed an equal mass of ice (from
the same freezer) in each beaker. Then they
monitored the temperature of each beaker.

Think about your interpretation of the students’
experiment and the discussion prior to this
ThoughtLab. What are three important factors to
consider when measuring the thermal energy
change of a substance?
The ThoughtLab gave you some insight into the factors that are important
when measuring energy changes. How can you use these factors to calcu-
late the quantity of heat that is transferred? First you must examine each
factor and determine its relationship to heat transfer. You will begin with
the most obvious factor: temperature. Then you will look at how the mass
of a substance affects the quantity of thermal energy it can store. Finally,
you will look at the type of substance and how it affects heat transfer.

Temperature
In the summer, your body temperature is fairly close to
the temperature of your surroundings. You do not need
to wear extra clothing to keep warm. When winter hits
with fierce winds and cold temperatures, however, dressing
warmly becomes a necessity. The temperature of your sur-
roundings is now much colder than your body temperature.
Heat is transferred from your body to your surroundings,
making you feel cold. The extra clothing helps to minimize
heat loss from your body. (See Figure 14.10.)
Temperature is directly related to heat transfer. A large

change in temperature indicates a large energy change.
A small change in temperature indicates a small energy How do you con-
change. Therefore, temperature is an important factor when trol the temperature of your body?
calculating heat transfer. The temperature variable that is
used is the change in temperature. This is symbolized by AT.
Mass of Substance
Did you know that 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water? This
enormous mass of water absorbs and releases tremendous amounts of
heat energy. Water makes our climate more moderate by absorbing heat
in hot weather and releasing heat in cold weather. The greater the mass
of the water, the greater the amount of heat it can absorb and release.
(Areas without much water, such as deserts, experience huge variations
in temperature.) Therefore, mass is directly related to heat transfer. Mass
is a variable in the calculation of heat energy. It is symbolized by a
lower-case m.

How do you measure the quantity of energy that is produced? In this
section, you will focus on measuring heat changes. You will learn about
some technology and techniques to measure heat. You will then apply
what you have learned by performing your own heat experiments.
Calorimetry
In the ThoughtLab in section 14.3, two students used beakers with no lids
when they measured change in temperature. The students assumed that
energy was being exchanged only between the ice and the water. In fact,
energy was also being exchanged with the surroundings. As a result, the
data that the students obtained had a large experimental error. How could
the students have prevented this error?
Much of the technology in our lives is designed to stop the flow of
heat. Your home is insulated to prevent heat loss in the winter and heat
gain in the summer. If you take hot soup to school for your lunch, you
probably use a ThermosTM to prevent heat loss to the environment.
Whenever there is a temperature difference between two objects,
thermal energy flows from the hotter object to the colder object. When
you measure the heat being transferred in a reaction or other process,
you must minimize any heat that is exchanged with the surroundings.

or
Heat gained by the process = Heat lost by the water
In the next Sample Problem, you will use what you have just learned to
calculate the specific heat capacity of a metal. This problem is similar to
the calculation of the specific heat capacity of canola oil in section 14.3.
Here, however, a calorimeter is used to reduce the heat exchange to the
environment.
Determining a Metal’s Specific Heat Capacity
Problem
A 70.0 g sample of a metal was heated to 95.0°C in a hot water bath.
Then it was quickly transferred to a polystyrene calorimeter. The
calorimeter contained 100.0 g of water at an initial temperature of
19.8°C. The final temperature of the contents of the calorimeter was
22.6°C.
(a) How much heat did the metal lose? How much heat did the
water gain?
(b) What is the specific heat capacity of the metal?
What Is Required?
(a) You need to calculate the heat lost by the metal (Q,,) and the
heat gained by the water (Q,).
(b) You need to calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal.
What Is Given?
You know the mass of the metal, and its initial and final
temperatures.
Mass of metal (mm) = 70.0 g
Initial temperature of metal (T;) = 95.0°C
Final temperature of metal (T;) = 22.6°C
You also know the mass of the water, and its initial and final
temperatures.
Mass of water (m,,) = 100.0 g
Initial temperature of water (T;) = 19.8°C
Final temperature of water (T;) = 22.6°C
As well, you know the specific heat capacity of water: 4.184 J/g-°C.

(a) You have all the information that you need to find the heat gained
by the water. Use the heat equation Q = mcAT. To find the heat
lost by the metal, assume that Qn = —Qw.
(b) Calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal by rearranging
the heat equation and solving for c.
It is very important that you do not mix up the given information.
For example, when solving for the thermal energy change of the
water, Qy, make sure that you only use variables for the water. You
must use the initial temperature of the water, 19.8°C, not the initial
temperature of the metal, 95.0°C. Also, remember that AT = T;— Tj.

The heat gained by the water is a positive value. The heat lost by the
metal is a negative value. The heat is expressed in joules. (Kilojoules
are also acceptable.)
The specific heat capacity of the metal is positive, and it has the

Heat of Combustion
How much energy is needed for a natural gas water heater, like the one
shown in Figure 14.18, to heat the hot water in your home? It is probably
much more than you think! In the next Sample Problem, you will find
out. You will also calculate the heat of combustion of a hydrocarbon: the
heat that is released when combustion occurs.
Calculating Thermal Energy
Problem
Many homes in North America use natural gas for general heating
and for water heating. Like calorimeters, natural gas water heaters
have an insulated container that is filled with water. A gas flame at
the bottom heats the water. A typical water heater might hold 151 L
of water.
(a) How much thermal energy is needed to raise the temperature of
151 L of water from 20.5°C to 65.0°C? Note: Make the same three
assumptions that you made for calorimeters.
(b) If it takes 506 g of methane to heat this water, what is the heat of
combustion of methane per gram?
What Is Required?
(a) You need to calculate the quantity of thermal energy (Q) needed
to heat 151 L of water.
(b) You need to calculate the heat released per gram of methane
burned.
What Is Given?
(a) You know the initial and final temperatures of the water. You also
know the volume of the water.
Initial temperature (Tj) = 20.5°C
Final temperature (7;) = 65.0°C
Volume = 151 L
As well, you know the specific heat capacity of water (c):
4.184 J/g-°C or 4.184 kJ/kg-°C.
(b) You know the mass of the methane. Mass of methane (m) = 506 g
Plan Your Strategy
(a) This problem involves thermal energy and a change in tempera-
ture. You can use the heat equation Q = mcAT. First calculate the
mass of 151 L of water. (Remember that the density of water at
room temperature is 1 g/mL, or 1 kg/L.) If you express the mass of
the water in kilograms, you must also use the appropriate specific
heat capacity of water: 4.184 kJ/kg-°C.
Note: To keep the calculation simple, assume that the density of
the water remains the same when it is heated. (This is not strictly
true.)

(b) Use the concept of heat lost = heat gained. Since a loss of heat
gives a negative value, use the following equation.
Qm = —Qw
To find the heat per gram, divide the amount of heat by the mass
of methane.
Act on Your Strategy
(a) Mass of water = Volume x Density
= (151 L)(1 kg/L)
=151kg
Substitute into Q = mcAT, and solve.
Q = mcAT
= (151 kg)(4.184 kJ/kg-°C)(65.0°C — 20.5°C)
= 28 114 (kg)(kJ/kg-2(CeE))
= 2.81 x 10* kJ
Therefore, 2.81 x 10* kJ, or 28.1 MJ (megajoules), of energy is needed
to heat the water. (This is a great deal of energy!)
(b) Qmn = —-Qw
= —2.81 x 10* kJ
Divide the amount of heat by the mass of methane to find the
heat per gram.
Qm (per gram) — = ~ Q imn,
_ —2.81 x 10*kJ
506 g
= -55.5 kj/g
This means that 55.5 kJ of thermal (heat) energy is released
for each gram of methane that burns.
Check Your Solution
(a) The water gains heat, so the heat value is positive.
Heat is expressed in kilojoules. (Joules are also acceptable.)
(b) The methane loses energy, so the heat value is negative. Since
this value is the heat per gram, the unit is kJ/g.

A bomb calorimeter is calibrated for a constant mass of water. Since the
mass of the other parts remain constant, there is no need for mass units in
the heat capacity value. The manufacturer usually includes the heat
capacity value(s) in the instructions for the calorimeter.
Heat calculations must be done differently when the heat capacity of a
calorimeter is included. The next Sample Problem illustrates this.

A laboratory decided to test the energy content of peanut butter. A
technician placed a 16.0 g sample of peanut butter in the steel bomb
of a calorimeter, along with sufficient oxygen to burn the sample
completely. She ignited the mixture and took heat measurements.
The heat capacity of the calorimeter was calibrated at 8.28 kJ/°C.
During the experiment, the temperature increased by 50.5°C.

GETIEEELSZ Food contains
energy, which is usually
measured in Calories.
You have probably noticed that Calories are used more often than
kilojoules when discussing the energy in food (Figure 14.21). How are
these terms related?
For years, chemists used the calorie as a unit of energy. One calorie is
equal to 4.184 J. This is the amount of energy that is required to heat 1 g
of liquid water by 1°C. The food Calorie (notice the upper-case C) is equal
to one thousand calories, or one kilocalorie. Therefore one food Calorie is
equal to 4.184 kj.

Comparing Fats and Hydrocarbons
One of the substances that you considered in the last ThoughtLab was
oleic acid. Oleic acid has a long hydrocarbon chain in each molecule.
This hydrocarbon chain is similar to the hydrocarbon chains of fossil
fuels, such as octane. (See Figure 14.23.)

Most of the energy change in a reaction is due to a change in the
potential energy (stored energy) of the bonds. All hydrocarbon fuels are
made of the same elements: carbon and hydrogen. They react to give the
same combustion products. As a result, the difference in the quantity of
heat energy that is released by any two hydrocarbons is directly related to
the stored energy in the bonds of these compounds. The next ThoughtLab
compares the heat energy that is released by the combustion of two fuels:

The Combustion of Candles
So far in this chapter, you have focussed on gaseous hydrocarbons, such
as methane and acetylene. You have examined their heats of combustion
and various processes in which they are used. In your everyday life, you
may have encountered another type of hydrocarbon: paraffins. Paraffins
are long chain hydrocarbons. They are semisolid or solid at room
temperature. One type of paraffin has been a household item for cen-
turies—paraffin wax, C25Hs52(s), better known as candle wax. (See Figure
14.25.)
Like other hydrocarbons, the paraffin wax in candles undergoes com-
bustion when burned. It releases thermal energy in the process. In the fol-
lowing investigation, you will measure this thermal energy.

dies have been an important light
source for hundreds of years.

heat pack is re-usable. It contains a supersaturated solution of a salt
and a disc of metal. When the metal disc is bent, the solute begins to
crystallize and releases heat. The pack can be reset by heating it in
boiling water, which causes the salt to dissolve again. How can you
account for the heat that is released by this kind of pack?

advantage, or positive result. For example, riding a bicycle provides the
benefits of exercise, transportation, and enjoyment. When deciding to do
an activity, it may be a good idea to compare the risks and benefits
involved. (See Figure 14.29.)
Risk-Benefit Analysis
Knowing more about an issue helps you assess its risks and benefits

Follow these steps to do your own assessment of risks and benefits, called
a risk-benefit analysis.
Step1 Identify possible risks and benefits of the activity. Decide how to
research these risks and benefits.
Step 2 Research the risks and benefits. You need information from reliable
sources to make an accurate analysis.
Step3 Weigh the effects of the risks and benefits. You may find that the
risks are too great and decide not to do the activity. On the other
hand, you may find that the benefits are greater than the risks.

greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere and
prevent the heat from escaping into outer space. Scientists think that a
build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may lead to an increase in
global temperature, known as global warming. The diagram below shows
how these concepts are connected to fossil fuels.

Acid Rain
The combustion of fossil fuels releases sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These
oxides react with water vapour in the atmosphere to produce acid rain.
Some lakes in northern Canada are “dead” because acid rain has killed
the plants, algae, and fish that used to live in them. Forests in Québec
and other parts of Canada have also suffered from acid rain.
Oil Spill Pollution
Our society demands a regular supply of fossil fuels. Petroleum is trans-
ported from oil-rich countries to the rest of the world. If an oil tanker
carrying petroleum has an accident, the resulting oil spill can be
disastrous to the environment.

e Become more informed by researching issues that concern you.
e Fix oil leaks in vehicles, and avoid dumping oil down the sink.

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you learned about some of the risks and benefits resulting
from our use of fossil fuels. We obtain gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel, diesel
fuel, fertilizers, and plastics from the oil and petroleum industry. Burning
fossil fuels, however, produces carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) and
other pollutants that lead to acid rain. Transporting oil also carries the
risk of oil spills. Do the benefits of fossil fuels outweigh the risks?

What other challenges might humans face while developing this planet?
You may want to investigate a different problem. For example:
Unit 1
e Suppose matter on the new planet were not composed of electrons,
protons, and neutrons. Devise a new atomic theory of your own. Explain
how it works in “real life” on the planet. Make up a small, functional
periodic table with new, imaginary elements.
e Develop rules that explain the bonding between your new atoms.
How do these rules affect the reactivity of your elements and structure
of your compounds?
Unit 2
e Suggest reactions that may make life easier on the planet. Research and
perform these reactions in the laboratory. Write balanced equations, and
calculate percent yields in moles and in grams. Explain the purpose of
these reactions in the settlers lives.
Unit 3
e Suggest one or more substances that may already be dissolved in the
water on the newly-discovered planet. Test the solubility of the sub-
stance and plot solubility curves for the solute in water. Explain why
the substance is in the water, and how the substance will affect the life
of the settlers. For example, is it safe to drink? How can it be removed
from the water? Once extracted, can it be used for anything else?

Expanding the Bohr's Model of the Atom
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr developed a
Model of the Atom model of the atom that explained the hydrogen emission
spectrum. In Bohr’s model, electrons orbit the nucleus
in the same way that Earth orbits the Sun, as shown in

is quantized, it means that it is limited to discrete
400 nm 500 nm 600 nm 700 nm amounts or multiples of discrete amounts. Two great
scientists paved the way for this surprising idea.
German physicist Max Planck had already suggested
that energy in general was quantized, meaning that it
exists in “packets.” Building on this idea, Einstein
proposed that light could behave as particles, which
he called photons.
The energy associated with the light in a line
spectrum corresponds with the change in energy of an
electron as it moves up or down an energy level. For
example, when electrons in hydrogen atoms that have
been excited to the third energy level subsequently drop
to the second energy level, they emit light that has a

spectrum, which is like a “fingerprint” for that element.
Why a New Model?
So what was the problem? Bohr’s model worked
beautifully, correctly predicting the line spectrum for

hydrogen. It also worked fine for ions with one electron,
such as He’, Li**, Be**, etc. The model failed, however,
when it was applied to the emission spectra of atoms
that had more than one electron. Bohr’s model needed
to be modified, because it was too simple to explain the
experimental evidence.
Sublevels
The spectra of many-electron atoms suggested that a
more complex structure was needed. Notice in Figure
D.1 that spectra for these more complex atoms have
groups of lines close together. The groups are separated
by spaces. The large spaces represent the energy differ-
ences between energy levels, while the smaller spaces
represent energy differences within the levels.
If the electrons are changing energy within the
levels, this suggests that there are sublevels within each
level, each with its own slightly different energy. The
idea of energy levels 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. remains, but each
energy level is split up into sublevels called s, p, d,
and /f. Examine Table D.1 to see how electrons are
arranged in sublevels for energy levels 1 to 4.

Visualizing the New Model
But where do you find the electrons in this new model?
How are the sublevels oriented in space? Several
theories enabled scientists to describe what the newly
conceived atom “looked like.”
Particles with Wave-Like Properties
In 1924, Louis de Broglie, a young physics student,
suggested that all matter had wave-like properties. This
seemed to follow from Planck and Einstein’s idea that
electromagnetic radiation has matter-like properties.
De Broglie developed an equation that allowed him to
calculate the wavelength of the matter wave associated
with any object, from a bowling ball to an electron.
Objects that we can see and can interact with have
calculated wavelengths that are smaller than electrons.
Their wavelengths are so tiny compared to their size
that they do not have any measurable effect on the
motion of the objects.
For very tiny moving particles, however, such as
electrons, the wavelength becomes very significant.
In fact, an electron moving at an average speed has a
wavelength even larger than the size of the entire
hydrogen atom!
De Broglie’s theory was proven by experiment
when streams of electrons produced diffraction patterns
similar to those produced by electromagnetic radiation,
which was already known to travel in waves.
Orbitals
In 1926, Erwin Schrodinger used de Broglie’s idea that
matter has wavelike properties. Schrédinger proposed
what is now known as the quantum mechanical model
of the atom. In this new model, he abandoned the
notion of the electron as a small particle orbiting the
nucleus. Instead, he took into account the particle’s
wavelike properties, and described the behaviour of
electrons in terms of wave functions.
The imprecise nature of Schrédinger’s model was
supported shortly afterwards by a principle proposed by
Werner Heisenberg, in 1927. Heisenberg demonstrated
that it is impossible to know both an electron’s path-
way and its exact location. Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle is a mathematical relationship that shows that
you can never know both the position and the momen-
tum of an object beyond a certain measure of precision.
The momentum of an object is its mass multiplied by its
velocity. An object's momentum is directly related to the
O's amount of energy it has.
GETISIEX] This figure shows the relative energies of
sublevels in energy levels 1, 2, and 3.

Heisenberg also showed that if you could know either Shapes of Orbitals

probability of finding an electron.
Imagine you were able to take many exact measure-
ments of the position of an electron in the 1s sublevel
at fixed intervals. At each second, you would mark the
electron’s position on a graph. After a while, your graph
might look something like the first diagram in Figure
D.4. If someone tried to use your graph to determine
where the electron was, they would not be able to state
its position exactly. They would, however, be able to
see that the probability of finding the electron would be 2s
greater near the nucleus and would decrease farther
away from the nucleus.
The probability graph is “fuzzy,” because the proba-
bility of finding an electron anywhere in a 1s sublevel
is never zero. The probability becomes extremely small
when it is far away from the nucleus, but it never quite
reaches zero. Therefore, to obtain an exact shape for
an orbital, you need to choose a level of probability.
For example, drawing a contour that encompasses
95 percent of the probability graph results in a spherical 2py 2p
shape, like the third diagram in Figure D.4. In other

Examine the graph in Figure E.4B. You can see that the

between the volume and the inverse pressure.
Mathematically, this means that the volume is
directly proportional to the inverse pressure, or V « +

What happens if the data do not give a line that goes
through the origin? The data in Table E.3 came from
an experiment to determine the density of an unknown
liquid. The student forgot to measure the mass of the
container that was used to hold the various volumes
of the liquid.

These data are plotted, as shown in Figure E.5, with
the volume on the x-axis and the mass on the y-axis.
The equation of this line is in the form y = mx + b,
where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.
(The y-intercept is the value of y where the line crosses
the y-axis. This value occurs when x = 0.) Thus, the
relationship here is m = kV + b, where the k is the slope
of the line. As before,
k= (Vo - ya)
(x2 — X1)
_ (97.2 — 63.8) g

Therefore, the equation of the line is m = 0.668V + b.
If there is no liquid, both the mass and the volume of
the liquid are zero. Notice, however, that there is still a
value for mass on the graph. This is the value of b, the
y-intercept, which is 43.8 g. It represents the mass of
the container. Therefore, the final equation is
m = 0.668V + 43.8.
Consider one more example. Two different sets of
data for Charles’ law experiments are given in Table E.4.
Table E.4 Charles’ Law Data

55 168 51 270
68 175 80 294
The linear graphs of both sets of data are given in
Figure E.6, on the same pair of axes. Since two different
samples of gas were used, there are two different lines
in the form y = mx + b. Notice that the lines intersect at
—273°C, or 0 K, the theoretical lowest temperature possi-
ble. (The linear graphs for the temperature and volume
of all gases go through this point.) If the y-axis was
moved to this point and a new origin was established
here, then the equations for the lines would be in the
form y = mx. This is what happens when you convert
temperatures to the Kelvin scale.
