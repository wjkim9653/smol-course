Start-Up Ativity
Scientists have been able to gather information about atoms without actually seeing
them. Perform the following activity to
an idea about the structure of the atom:
Take an onion: It looks solid. Peel off a layer; and you will find another layer
underneath: Layer after layer surfaces as the onion is
off:

to its core.
Analysis
1. How do you compare this with the atomic model?
2.
What do the layers represent in the atomic model?
3.
What does the core represent in the atom?
Two thousand years ago, ancient Greek philosophers developed a theory of matter
that was not based
on the
experimental evidences
A notable Greek philosopher;
namely, Democritus, believed that all matter was composed of very tiny, indivisible
particles He called them atomos. Hence; the word
atom
came from the Greek word
atomos, which means uncuttable or indivisible.
Aristotle was part of the generation that succeeded Democritus. He did not believe in
atomos. Aristotle thought that all matter was continuous That is, if one proceeded on
breaking down a substance, it would be impossible to reach to the last indivisible
particle. In other words, it would continue to divide infinitely: His opinion
was
accepted for nearly 200 years.
The early concept of atoms was simply a result of thinking and reasoning on the part
of the philosophers, instead of experimental observations. In 1803, however; John
Dalton proposed a completely different theory of matter: His theory was based on
scientific experimental observations and logical laws These scientific assumptions were

very closely related to what is presently known about the atom: Due to this, John
Dalton is often referred to as the father of modern atomic theory:
Dalton also worked on the relative masses of atoms and gave symbols to
some
elements as illustrated in Figure 1.1.

Atomic Theory
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
describe Dalton's atomic theory;
describe modern atomic theory; and
compare and contrast Dalton's atomic theory with modern atomic theory:
Activity 1.1
Form a group and discuss the following idea: Dalton's contribution was different from that
of the ancient Greeks who postulated the existence of atoms. Point out the differences
between the two ideas Present your discussion to the class.
Even though the idea of the existence of atoms and atomic theory dates back to
classical times, as discussed earlier; only Dalton's atomic theory ideas were the basis
for the new
era of science.
1.1.1
Dalton's Atomic Theory
Historical Note
British physicist and chemist John Dalton is best known for
developing the atomic theory of elements and
molecules; the
foundation of modern physical science. While pondering the
nature of the atmosphere during a meteorological study in the
early 1800s, Dalton deduced the structure of carbon dioxide and
proposed
that
an
exact
number of atoms constitute
each
molecule He held that all atoms of a given element are identical
and different from the atoms of every other element The first to
John
Dalton
classify elements according to their atomic weights, Dalton set
the stage for a revolution in scientific thought:
3
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
In 1804, John Dalton developed the first modern theory of atoms and proposed their
existence. Dalton's atomic theory was based directly o the ideas of elements and
compounds, and on the three laws of chemical combination. The three laws are:
i)
The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created
nor
destroyed. This law is also called the law of indestructibility of matter: It means
that the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the mass of the products in
any chemical reaction. A chemical reaction involves only the separation and union
of atoms.
ii)
The law of definite proportions states that
a
pure   compound is always
composed of the same elements combined in
a definite ratio by mass. For
example, water (HzO) is composed of hydrogen and oxygen only These elements
are
always in the proportion of 11.19% hydrogen to 88.81% oxygen by mass
and in the proportion 2
1
by volume.
iii)
The law of multiple proportions states that when two different compounds are
formed from the same elements, the masses of one of the elements in the two
compounds, compared to a given mass of the other element; is in a small whole-
number ratio. For example, carbon and oxygen form two compounds: carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide contains 1.3321 g of oxygen
for each
1
g of carbon, whereas carbon dioxide contains 2.6642 g of oxygen
for each lg of carbon. Hence, carbon dioxide contains twice the mass of oxygen
as does carbon monoxide.
Activily 1.
Form a group and
perform the following task Present your findings to the class
Using two chemical compounds as an example; describe the difference between the law
of definite proportions and the law of multiple proportions.
Dalton proved that these laws are entirely reasonable if the elements are composed of
particles, which he called atoms:
An atom is the smallest fundamental particle of
an element.
The basic postulates of Dalton $ Atomic Theory are summarized aS follows:
1.
AIl elements are made up of small particles called atoms
2
Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.
3.
All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and in all other
properties.
4_
Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
5.
Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine.
6_
In a given compound, the relative numbers and types of atoms are constant:

tiny
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
Although some of these postulates, like postulate number 2 and number 3, have been
shown to be incorrect by later work, Dalton's theory
was
a
brilliant and logical
explanation of many experimental discoveries and laws that were known at that time.
Activity 1.3
Form a group. Discuss the following laws and present to the class
Use Dalton's atomic theory to explain:
a
The law of conservation f mass
b
The law of definite proportions
The law of multiple proportions.
1.1.2
Modern
Atomic Theory
Towards the end of the 9th century, various experimental discoveries revealed the
existence of subatomic particles, isotopes, and
So
on.
In light of these findings,
Dalton's Atomic Theory was modified
The Modern Atomic Theory can be summarized aS follows:
1 .
Atoms are the smallest
particles of all elements that can take part in a chemical
reaction:
2
An atom is divisible. It can be subdivided into electrons, protons, and neutrons
An atom is also indestructible
atoms can neither be created nor destroyed
during ordinary chemical reactions.
3_
Atoms of the same element may not be identical in mass because of the existence
of isotopes:
4_
Atoms of the same elements have identical chemical properties.
5.
Atoms of different elements have different chemical properties
6_
Atoms of two O more elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form
compounds.

Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

the discovery of the nucleus;
the discovery of the neutron:
Activity 1.4
Form a group and discuss the
following ideas
Present your discussion to the rest of the
class.
1.
In your
7
chemistry lesson, you
have learned that atoms consist of three
fundamental subatomic particles What are these? Where is their location in the atoms?
What are their charges?
2.
What were the consequences of the discoveries of subatomic particles on
Dalton's
atomic theory?
In the late 1880's, John Dalton thought atoms were indivisible. However; a series of
investigations and astounding discoveries clearly demonstrated that atoms are made up
of smaller particles, called subatomic particles. The three fundamental subatomic
particles of an atom are electrons, protons, and neutrons
1.2.1
Discovery of the Electron
Do you think that there is a similarity between cathode rays and electrons?
The electron was the first subatomic particle to be identified. In 1879,
William
Crooke
studied
electrical discharges
in  partially evacuated
tubes
called
discharge tubes.
Two electrodes fiom a high-voltage source are sealed into a glass tube from which air
has been evacuated The negative electrode is the cathode and the positive one is the
anode.
When the high-voltage current is turned 0n, the glass tube emits a greenish
light and a beam of light is seen at the anode. These rays flow from the cathode
towards the anode in a straight line.
are called cathode rays. Later 0n, in 1897,
JJJ. Thomson found that the beam was deflected by both electrical and magnetic

bend toward the positive plate. From this he concluded
that the cathode rays are made up of very small negatively charged particles, which he
named electrons. He concluded that electrons are constituents of all matter; because
he obtained the same results when he changed the gas and the electrode in the tube.

The properties of cathode rays (like charge to mass ratio, e-/m ratio) do not
depend on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube or o the material of the
cathode. This shows that electrons are present in the atoms of all elements.
Thus, cathode-ray experiments provided evidence that atoms are divisible into small
particles, and that one of the atom's basic constituents is the negatively charged
particle called electron.
PROJECT WORK
Produce a model of cathode ray tube from simple and locally available materials
such as glass tube, copper wire andrubber stoppers. Using your model showhow
cathode rays are generated and explain their properties.
Charge and Mass of an Electron
JJ. Thomson studied the deflection of cathode rays under the simultaneous application
of electric and magnetic fields, that are applied perpendicular to each other: His
experiment led to the precise determination of the charge-to-mass ratio (eIm) of an
electron; and this
e Im
value was found to be 1.76

unit of electric charge.
Activily 1.5
Form a group and discuss how JJ Thomson's determination of the charge-to-mass ratio of
the electron led to the conclusion that atoms were composed of sub atomic particles
Present your findings to the class.
In 1909, Robert Millikan determined the charge of an electron (e), using the oil
experiment: He found the charge of an electron to be 1.60
coulombs.
Combination of eIm and e
values are used to determine the mass of an electron;
which is found to be 9.11

1.2.2
Discovery
of the Atomic Nucleus
Radioactivity
In 1895, the German physicist, Wilhelm Rontgen noticed that cathode rays caused
glass and metals to emit very unusual rays This highly energetic radiation penetrated
matter; darkened covered photographic plates, and caused a variety of substances to
fluoresce. Since these rays could not be deflected by a magnet; they could not contain
charged particles as cathode rays do. Rontgen called them X-rays.
Not
after Rontgen's discovery, Antoine Becquerel,
a
professor of physics in
Paris, began to study fluorescent properties of substances. He found that exposing
thickly wrapped photographic plates to a certain uranium compound caused them to
darken, even without the stimulation of cathode rays. Like X-rays, the rays from the
uranium compound were highly energetic and could not be deflected by a magnet
Also, these rays were generated spontaneously: One of Becquerel's students, Marie
Curie, suggested the name radioactivity to describe this spontaneous emission of
particles  and/or radiation: Consequently, any element that spontaneously emits
radiation is said to be radioactive.
Further investigation revealed that three types of rays are produced by the "decay'
or
breakdown of radioactive substances such as uranium, polonium; and radium: These
are alpha, beta, and gamma rays.
Alpha (0) rays consist of positively charged particles called &-particles
are
deflected by positively charged plates. Beta (8) rays or B-particles are electrons of
nuclear origin that are deflected by negatively charged plates  The third type of
radioactive radiation consists of high-energy rays called gamma
rays Like X-rays;
Y-rays have no charge and are not affected by an external electric O magnetic field
Activity 1.6
Form a group and discuss the following ideas Present your discussion to the class.
Scientists discovered the three subatomic particles (electrons, protons and
neutrons).
Compare and contrast these fundamental sub atomic particles with alpha particles, beta
particles and gamma rays in terms of the nature of the particles.
More details  about the structure of
an
atom
were
provided in
1911
by Ernest
Rutherford and his associates, Hans  Geiger and Ernest Marsden.
The  scientists
long
They
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
bombarded a thin
foil with fast moving alpha particles Alpha particles are positively
charged particles with about four times the mass of a hydrogen atom.
Geiger and
Marsden assumed that mass and charge were uniforly distributed throughout the atoms
of the
foil Therefore,
expected the alpha particles to pass through the
foil
with only a slight deflection: However; when the scientists checked for the possibility of
wide-angle deflections;
were shocked to find that roughly 1 in 8000 of the alpha
particles had actually been redirected back toward the source.
After
thinking about the observations for two years, Rutherford finally came up with
an
explanation:
He reasoned that the rebounded alpha particles
must  have
experienced some powerful force within the atom. He concluded that the source of
this force must occupy a very small amount of space because very few of the total
number of alpha particles had been affected by it: He also concluded that the force
must be caused by a very densely packed bundle of matter with & positive electric
charge. Rutherford called this small, dense, positive bundle of matter the nucleus.

Since most of the &-particles passed through the

the space in an atom is empty:

Some ofthe &-particles were deflected by small
This indicated the presence
of a heavy positive centre in the atom, which Rutherford named the nucleus
3_
Only a few particles (1 in about a million) were either deflected by a very large
angle or deflected back. This confirmed that the space
occupied by the heavy
positive centre must be very small.

m. Therefore, the nucleus is about 1/10,000 (one ten-thousandth)
of the size of the atom
as a
whole. Thus, if we magnified an atom to the size of a
football stadium
about 100 m across), the nucleus would be represented by a pea
placed at the centre of the pitch:
Rutherford suggested that the negatively charged electrons surrounding the positively
charged nucleus are like planets around the sun revolving: He could not explain;
however; what kept the electrons in motion around the nucleus.
1.2.3
Discovery of Neutrons
In 1932, an English scientist, James Chadwick, identified the existence of neutrons.
He bombarded a thin foil of beryllium with &-particles of a radioactive substance. He
then observed that highly penetrating rays, consisting of electrically neutral particles of
a
mass
approximately equal to that of the proton,
were
produced. These neutral
particles are called neutrons.
neutron is a subatomic
particle carrying no charge and having a mass of 1.675 x
10-24 g: This mass is almost equal to that of a proton O of a hydrogen atom:

Except for the nucleus of the simplest type of hydrogen atom, all atomic
nuclei are made of two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons. Surrounding the
nucleus, there is a region occupied by negatively charged particles called electrons.
This

Atoms of different elements have different number of protons

For different elements, the nuclei of their atoms differ in the number of protons

differ in the amount of positive charge that their atoms
possess Thus, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines the identity
of an atom:
Each atom of an element is identified by its atomic number: In the periodic table, the
atomic number of an element is indicated below its symbol. Notice that the elements
are
placed in order of increasing atomic number: Hydrogen, H, has atomic number 1,
hence, atoms of the element hydrogen have one proton in the nucleus. Next is helium;
which has two protons in its nucleus Lithium; Li, has three protons. Beryllium;
Be, has four protons, and so o.

and it is radioactive. It exists in very small amounts in nature, but it can be prepared
artificially. Each tritium atom contains
one
proton and
two neutrons.
Protium;
deuterium and tritium are the three isotopes of hydrogen:
Isotopes are the atoms of the same element that have the same atomic number but different
masses number: The isotopes of a particular element have the same number of protons and
electrons but different number of neutrons. Isotopes of an element may occur naturally, or
they may be made in the laboratory (artificial isotopes). Since isotopes have the same
number of protons and electrons,
have the same chemical properties
Designating Isotopes
Isotopes
are usually identified by specifying their mass number: There
are two
methods for specifying isotopes
In the first method, the mass number is written
with
a
hyphen after the name of the element: Tritium, for example, is written as
Hydrogen-3. We will refer to this method as hyphen notation. The second method for

for example; has a mass 0f 2.657
X
10-23g. For most chemical calculations, it is more
convenient to use relative atomic masses. In order to set up a relative scale of atomic
mass, one atom has been arbitrarily chosen as the standard and assigned a relative mass
value. The masses of all other atoms are expressed in terms of this defined standard.
The standard used by scientists to determine units of atomic mass is the carbon-l2
atom: It has been
arbitrarily assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units, Or 12
a.m.u. One atomic mass unit; Or

is exactly 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12
atom;
or

The   atomic
mass
of any
atom
is   determined by
comparing it with the mass of the carbon-12 atom: The hydrogen-1 atom has
an
atomic mass of about 1/12 of that of the carbon-l2 atom, or about
1
a.m.u. The
precise value of the atomic mass of a hydrogen-1 atom is 1.007 a.m.u.
An oxygen-
16
atom
has
about
16/12
(or  4/3
the
mass   of
a

atom).
Careful
measurements show the atomic mass of oxygen-16 to be 15.994 a.m.u. The mass
of a
magnesium-24 atom is found to be slightly less than twice that of a carbon-12
atom: Its atomic mass is 23.985

The masses of subatomic particles can also be expressed on the atomic-mass scale.
The mass of an electron is 0.0005486 a.m.u, that of the proton is 1.007276 a.m.u,
and that of the neutron is 1.008665 a.m.u. Note that the proton and neutron masses

Average Atomic Masses of Elements
Most elements occur naturally as mixtures of isotopes, as shown in the examples in
Table 1.3. The percentage of each isotope in the naturally occurring elements is nearly
always the same, no matter where the element is found  The percentage at which each
isotope of an element occurs in nature is taken into account when calculating the
average atomic mass of the element: Average atomic mass is the weighted average of

many times. But, at present we can reduce these ideas into five models: Dalton's
Model, Thomson's Model, Rutherford's Model, Bohr's Model, and the Quantum
Mechanical Model.
Dalton's Atomic Model
This model of atoms
was
accepted for 100 years without serious challenge. He
thought of atoms as solid indestructible spheres. He called it the billiard ball model

atom; which is shown in Figure 1.8. It is sometimes called the plum-pudding model In

were embedded
inside a positively charged sphere, just like plums in a pudding: Today we might call
Thomson's model the chocolate

STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
1911, evidence was collected that allowed scientists to modify Thomson's model
of an atom Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), a former student of Thomson, performed
one of the classic
experiments of scientific history: As indicated earlier in this unit; he
bombarded different types of matter with high-energy positively charged alpha
particles. Based on the Thomson's model of an atom; Rutherford hypothesized that
the alpha particles should go through very thin metal foils undeflected. However; after
performing an experiment on
leaf; he found that a small but significant number of
the alpha particles were deflected through large angles by the
atoms. These
results showed Rutherford that the Thomson model of the atom
was not valid.
A
uniform positive charge with embedded negatively charged electrons would not
interact with the alpha particles in such a manner:
The Rutherford model of the atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus
around which electrons whirl at high speeds and at relatively long distances from it:
He compared the structure of an atom with the solar system, saying that the nucleus
corresponds to the sun, while the electrons correspond to the planets. This picture of
the atom is also called the planetary atom. In other words, Rutherford gave us the
nuclear model of the atom
Even though Rutherford showed that the atom has a nucleus, he did not know how
the electrons were
arranged outside the nucleus This
was the major drawback of
Rutherford s model of an atom:
Figure 1.9 Rutherford model:
Historical Note
A
Nobel Prize winner; Niels Bohr; was known not only for his
own theoretical work, but also as a mentor to younger physicists
who themselves
made important contributions to physical
theory: As the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at
the University of Copenhagen; Bohr gathered together some of
the finest minds in the physics community including Werner
Heisenberg and George Gawow: During the 1920's,the Institute
was the source of many important works in quantum mechanics
and in theoretical physics in general.

Bohr
Model
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885_1962) proposed an atomic model in
which the electrons moved around the nucleus in circular
called orbits. He
assumed the electrons to be moving around the nucleus in
a circular orbit as the
planets move around the sun. Based on the Rutherford's atomic model, Bohr made
the following modifications
The electrons in an atom can exist only in a restricted number of stable orbits
with energy levels in which
neither absorb nor emit energy. These orbits
designated by a number called the principal quantum number; n The principal
quantum number has the values of 1, 2, 3,
The energy levels are also called
shells.
are
represented by K, L, M,
etc. The K-shell is the first shell,
the L-shell is the second shell; the M-shell is the third shell, etc:
When an electron moves between orbits it absorbs o emits energy. When an
electron jumps from lower to higher states it absorbs a fixed amount of energy:
When an electron falls from a higher (excited) state to a lower (ground) state it
emits a fixed amount of energy:
The electrons move around the nucleus in energy levels:
Figure 1.10 The first six energy levels in the Bohr model of an atom:
According to Bohr; for each element; the number of energy levels or shells is
fixed. Also, each different energy level or shell of an atom can only accommodate
a certain number of electrons. The maximum number of electrons that the main
energy level can have is given by the general formula 2n? , where n is
to
the main energy level:
Therefore, the maximum number of electrons in each shell in the Bohr model is:
first energy level
(n =
1) is 2(1)2
=
2 electrons
second energy level
(n =
2) is 2(2)2

When electrons fill the various energy levels in an atom,
first occupy the
shell with the lowest energy level. When the lowest energy level is filled, according
to the
rule, then the electrons enter the next higher energy level.
The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than eight electrons; even
if it has the capacity to hold more electrons. This is because having more than eight
electrons in the outermost shell makes the atom unstable.
For example, let us write the electron configuration of magnesium that has
12
electrons The first 2 electrons occupy the K-shell (the first energy level): The L-shell
'the second energy level) is occupied with 8 electrons The remaining 2 electrons
enter the M-shell (the third energy level) Hence, the electron configuration of

During the 1920's, the discovery of the wave-like properties of electrons led to the
wave-mechanical model or quantum-mechanical model of atoms.
In this model, the
electrons are associated with definite energy levels, but their locations cannot be
pinpointed. Instead,
are described in terms of the probability of being found in
certain regions of space about the nucleus. These
of space are called orbitals.
An orbital is a particularly shaped volume of space where the probability of finding an
electron is at a maximum
According to this model, the electrons in an atom are in a series of energy levels 0
shells. Each energy level
or shell is described by
a
number called the principal
quantum number; n, which is related to the size of the energy level. The larger the
energy value of n, the farther the electrons are found from the nucleus
The quantum mechanical model introduces the concept of sublevel for each main
energy level. For atoms of the known elements, there are four types of sublevels
designated by the letters $, P, d, and f: The number of sublevels within each energy
level or shell is equal to the numerical value of n.

orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. Accordingly,
S-sublevel has only 1 orbital and can hold a maximum of 2 electrons,
p-sublevel has 3 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 6 electrons,
d-sublevel has 5 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 10 electrons, and
f-sublevel has 7 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 14 electrons.
Electron  Configurations
The arrangement of electrons in an atom is known as the electron configuration of the
atom. Because atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons, a
distinct electronic configuration exists for the atoms of each element: Like all systems
in nature, electrons in atoms tend to
assume
arrangements that have the lowest
possible energies The lowest energy arrangement of the electrons in an atom is called
the ground state electron configuration:
A
few simple rules, combined with the
quantum number relationships discussed below; allow us to determine these ground-
state electron configurations.
The quantum mechanical model is designated by the following notation: a coefficient
which shows the main energy level, a letter that denotes the sublevel that an electron
occupies, and
a
superscript that shows the number of electrons in that particular
sublevel:
The designation is explained as follows

Rules Governing Electron Configuration
Mostofthe electronic configuration ofan atom can be explained in terms ofthebuilding-up
principle, or also knownas the Aufbau principle. According to the Aufbau principle,an
electron occupies thelowestenergy orbital availablebeforeenteringahigherenergy orbital.
Theatomic orbitalsare filledinorderofincreasingenergy Theorbital with thelowestenergy
is the ls orbital: The 2s orbital is the nexthigherin energy, then the 2p orbitals,ands0 on.
Beginningwith thethirdmain energy level,n=3,theenergies ofthesublevels inthedifferent
main energy levels begin to overlap.
In Figure 1.12, for example, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel.
Therefore, the 4s orbital is filled before any electrons enterthe 3dorbitals. Lessenergy is
required fortwo electrons topairup in the 4s orbital than forasingle electron to occupya3d
orbital. Which sublevelwill be occupiedafterthe 3dsublevelis fully occupied?

Unit Summary
The Greek philosopher Democritus proposed what we consider as the first atomic
theory: He believed that all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles. He
named the particles atoms (meaning uncuttable or indivisible)
John Dalton's
work in atomic theory marked the start of modern chemistry: His
concept of an atom was far more detailed and
specific than Democritus'.
Dalton did not
to describe the structure or
composition of atoms
he did not
know what an atom really looked like. But he did realize that the different properties
shown by elements such as hydrogen and oxygen can be
explained by assuming that
hydrogen atoms are not the same as oxygen atoms

atoms consist of smaller particles

In current views, the nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons. Protons have
positive charge, and neutrons have no charge. Each element has a unique number of
protons in its
atoms.
This number is the atomic number of the element; and is
designated by Z. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom

positive charge. Negatively
charged electrons are embedded in the positive charge.
Rutherford s Model: Rutherford discovered that atoms are mostly empty space
with a dense, positive nucleus.
Bohr's Model: in an atom, electrons follow circular orbits around the nucleus.
The Bohr Model was the first quantum mechanical model of the atom:
The Quantum Mechanical Model: in an atom;, the orbits of electrons around
the nucleus are elliptical. This theory is a modification of the Bohr model

PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
Activity 2.1
Form a group and discuss
the
following concepts. Present your discussion to the rest of
the class.
What
was the
basis for the early attempts
in classifying the elements? Outline the
contributions of some scientists you have read about in classfying the elements
Before the beginning of the 1&h century, it
was easy to study and remember the
properties of the elements because very few were known.
However; in the middle of
the 19h century, many
more elements
were discovered.  Scientists then began to
investigate possibilities for classifying the known elements in a simple and useful
manner:
After numerous attempts, the scientists were ultimately successful:
grouped elements with similar properties together: This arrangement is known as the
classification of elements.
Early Attempts  in  classifying
the
elements
What is
meant by the term periodicity? Can you give some periodic events in
nature?
Early attempts to classify elements were based merely on atomic mass Then scientists
began
to  seek
relationships  between atomic
mass   and other
properties of the
elements.
i)
Dobereiner's Triads:
One of the first attempts to group similar elements
was
made in 1817 by the German chemist J. Dobereiner: He
together similar
elements in group of three or triads
According to Dobereiner; when elements in
a
triad are
arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses, the middle element
had the average atomic mass of the other two elements. For example, because
the atomic
mass of bromine is nearly equal to the average atomic mass of
chlorine and iodine, he considered these three elements to constitute a triad when
arranged in this order: chlorine, bromine, iodine see Table 2.2.

The
Periodic Law
A
Mendeleevs   Periodic Law
In 1869, the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev and the German scientist Luthar
Meyer independently published periodic arrangements of the elements based on
increasing atomic mass.
Mendeleev observed that, when elements are arranged according to increasing atomic
mass, the chemical and physical properties of the elements recur at regular intervals.
This
periodic variation and the recurrence of the properties of the elements led to the
formulation of the Periodic Law.
Mendeleev's periodic law states that the properties of the elements
are
periodic
functions of their atomic masses. Only 63 elements were known when Mendeleev
constructed his table in 1871. Mendeleev organized his table in columns, with each
column containing elements that have similar chemical properties. Accordingly,
elements in the same column gave family or groups of elements
How did Mendeleev know where to leave gaps for undiscovered elements in his
periodic table?
Mendeleev left blank spaces for the undiscovered elements and also predicted masses
and other properties of these unknown elements almost correctly:
For example,
neither gallium nor germanium were discovered when Mendeleev constructed his
periodic table.
But he predicted the existence and properties of these unknown
elements.
Mendeleev left two blank spaces for these two elements in the table, just under
aluminium and silicon.
He called these unknown elements 'eka-aluminium' and 'eka-
silicon ' (eka' means 'first'
What he meant by 'eka-aluminium' is "a currently known
element (galium) following aluminium".
Later on, in 1874, the element Gallium (eka-aluminium in Mendeleev's system) was
discovered  In 1886, the element Germanium (eka-silicon)
was discovered. The
observed properties of these elements
were
remarkably very close
to those in
Mendeleev's predictions. Table 2.3 shows the properties of eka-silicon predicted by
Mendeleev and compares them to the observed properties of Germanium:

Position of isotopes: The isotopes were not given separate places in Mendeleev's

Since elements are
arranged in order of increasing atomic masses,
the isotopes belong to different groups (because isotopes have different masses)
2
Wrong order of atomic masses of some elements: When certain elements are
grouped on the basis of their chemical properties, some elements with higher
atomic masses precede those with lower atomic masses
For example, argon,
with atomic mass of 39.95, precedes potassium with atomic mass of 39.1.
B The Modern Periodic Law
What
was Mosley's contribution to the modern form of the Periodic Table?
In 1913, the English physicist
Mosley determined the atomic number of each of
the elements by analyzing their X-ray spectra. He observed that when each element
was
used
as
a
target in
an
tube, it gave out X-rays with
a
characteristic
wavelength. The wavelength depends on the number of protons in the nucleus of the
atom and was constant for a given element: By arranging the elements in order of
decreasing wavelength, Mosley was able to
atomic number to each element.
The atomic number of every element is fixed, and it clearly distinguishes one element
from another:
'No two elements can have the Same atomic number.' For
example,
atomic number & identifies the element oxygen. No other element can have atomic
number &

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
Therefore, the atomic number of
an  element is the fundamental property that
determines the chemical behavior of the element;
The discovery of atomic number led
to the development of the modern periodic law The modern periodic law states that:
) )
'the properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers.
This
means that when elements
are
arranged according to increasing atomic number,
elements with similar physical and chemical properties fall in the same group.
2.2.2
Characteristics of Groups and
Periods
Many different forms of the periodic table have been published since Mendeleev's
time. Today, the
form of the periodic table, which is called the modern periodic
table, is commonly in use. It is based o the modern periodic law. In the modern
periodic table, elements are arranged in periods ad groups
What are the basis for classifying the elements into groups and periods?
What
are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of S
and CI?
Periods:
The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods Or
series.
Elements in a
are
arranged in increasing order of their atomic numbers from left
to right
There are 7
periods in the modern periodic table, and each period is represented by
an Arabic numeral: 1, 2
and 7.
Elements in the same period have the same number of shells.
Periods 1, 2, and 3
are called short
periods while periods 4, 5, and
6
are
known as
periods
Period
1 contains only 2 elements, hydrogen and helium Period 2 and period 3
contain 8 elements each:
Period 4 and
period 5 contain 18 elements each: Period 6, the longest period,
has 32 elements. Period 7 , which is an incomplete period, contains more than
24 elements_Period 7 element is radioactive and/or an artificial element.
Except for the first period, all periods start with an alkali metal and ends with a
noble gas.

The position of an element in a
period can be determined by the number of
shells occupied with its electrons. Accordingly, the number of shell is equal to the
number of
'period to which the element belongs
Example
Electronic configuration of
23 Na
=
1s22s22p63s1 (2, 8, 1). Sodium has 3 main
11
shells Hence, sodium is found in period 3.
What are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of F
and CI?
Groups or families: are the vertical columns of elements in the periodic table:
There

Elements in a given group have the same number of outermost shell electrons
Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties:
For the main group elements the group number
the number of valence
electrons.

Periodic Properties within
a
Group
Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and also
exhibit Similar chemical properties.
For example, group IA elements have
1 valence
electron; those in Group IIA have 2 valence electrons, and so on. Generally it is
possible to conclude that the number of valence electrons determines the group
number of an element.

The periodic properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of nuclear
charge and effective nuclear charge.
Nuclear charge (Z): is the total positive charge in the nucleus of an atom
Effective Nuclear charge
eff
In
an atom; the
outermost  shell electrons
(or
valence electrons)
are attracted to the nucleus and simultaneously
repelled by the inner
shell electrons. The attraction of the nucleus for the valence electrons is also reduced
because inner electrons shield (or screen) the valence electrons. As a result; these
48
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
inner electrons reduce the attraction of the nuclear charge. The resulting net-positive
nuclear charge attracting the valence electrons is called effective nuclear charge, Zeff
Effective nuclear charge relates the nuclear charge to the number of shells (size) of the
atom
The effective nuclear charge is the difference between the nuclear charge
Z
and the
inner electrons
that shield the valence electrons The effective nuclear charge is
always less than the actual nuclear charge.
Z

Z _ S
eff
Let uS consider the sodium atom with its 11 electrons: 1s22s22p63s' (2, 8, 1).
The 10
inner electrons of sodium completely cancel the 10 units of nuclear charge o the
nucleus. In this way, the inner electrons shield the valence electrons from the full
attractive force of the nucleus and leave an effective nuclear charge of + 1 (Zefr=+ 1).
The fact that the inner electrons shield or screen the outer electrons from the full
charge of the nucleus is known as shielding or screening effect:
Activity 2.5
Form a group and perform the following task:
Draw Bohr's model for the following elements and indicate the shielding shells, shielding
electrons and effective nuclear charge:
a
beryllium, magnesium and calcium;
b
lithium, carbon and fluorine.
Present your
findings to the class.
The following properties of elements vary in
a
regular periodic manner:
1. Nuclear
Charge
On moving down a given group of the periodic table, nuclear charge progressively
increases, but effective nuclear charge remains nearly constant
2. Atomic Size/Atomic Radius
Where in
a group do you find atoms with the largest atomic radius? Why?
It is difficult to measure the Size of an atom directly: The electron cloud enveloping the
nucleus does not have a clear
boundary because its electrons do not have fixed
distances from the nucleus. Therefore, atoms do not have definite outer boundaries.
The size of an atom is defined in terms of its atomic radius. For metals, atomic radius
is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of the two adjacent atoms. For
49
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
elements that exist as diatomic molecules (such as chlorine), atomic radius is equal to
one-half of the distance between the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule. Figure 2.2
illustrates the atomic radius of chlorine in a chlorine molecule.

In

number of shells.

3. Ionization Energy
In which
region of the periodic table do you find elements with the:
0
lowest tendency to lose electrons, and
b highest tendency to lose electrons?
Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove the outermost shell
electron from an isolated gaseous atom or ion:
50
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
Ionization energy is represented by the following equation (where M denotes any
metal)_
M (g)
+ energy
Mt (g) + e
The electrons in an atom can be successively removed, one after another: Thus, the
first ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the first valence electron, the
second ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the second valence electron;
and so on.
M

+
energy
Mt (g) + e
First ionization energy
M+ (g
+

M2+
g
+ e
Second ionization energy
For a given element, the second ionization energy is higher than the first one.
Ionization energy is always a positive value (and therefore is an endothermic process)
because energy is required to remove an electron from an atom. Ionization energy is
measured in electron volts (eV
or
kiloJoules per mole (kJ/mol)
Ionization energy is a measure of the tendency of an atom to lose an electron Metals
easily lose electrons and thus have low ionization energy. Non-metals have high
ionization energy because they do not easily lose electrons
Activily 2.7
Form a group and
perform the following task Present your findings to the class
Rank each set of the following elements in order of decreasing ionization energy and
explain the trend in ionization energy of the elements down a group:
i)
Ca,
Sr;
Be
ii)
K
Li,
Rb,
Na
iii)
Cl,
F;
1,
Br
Generally, ionization energy is affected by the following factors:
1)
Atomic size: As atomic size increases, the valence electrons are less tightly
held by the nucleus Thus, less energy is required to remove these electrons.
For
example, the energy needed to remove an electron from a cesium atom is
lower than from a lithium atom
i)  Effective nuclear charge: The smaller the effective nuclear charge of an atom;
the lower is the energy needed to remove an electron from the atom:
iii)   Types of electrons: The closer an electron is to the nucleus; the more difficult
it is to remove the electron. In a
energy level, S-electrons are closer to
51
Mg,
given
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
the nucleus than p-electrons  Similarly, p-electrons are closer than d-electrons,
and   d-electrons
are   closer than f-electrons.
Hence, ionization   energy
decreases in the order of:
S
p
d > f.
iv) Screening effect by the inner electrons: As described earlier; inner shell
electrons shield the valence electrons from the nuclear charge. The more inner
electrons there are, the higher the screening effect; and therefore the easier it
is to remove the valence electrons. Screening decreases ionization energy:
Electron configuration (stability): It is easier to remove electrons from unstable
sublevels than from stable ones. Half-filled (p ,
d,f7) and completely-filled
p6, f14) sublevels
are
more   stable.
For  example,
more   energy is
required to remove a p' electron than a p' electron As a result of it,
the first
ionization energy of nitrogen is higher than that of oxygen.
Generally, with the increasing atomic number; the first ionization energy decreases
down the same group.
Activity 2.8
After studying the given information, identify the elements represented by X, M, and Y;
discuss the findings in your group, and then share your conclusion with the other groups

4. Electron

PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
Electron affinity is defined as the energy released in kilojoules/mole, when an electron
is added to an isolated gaseous atom to form a gaseous ion
It is a measure of the
attraction or *affinity' of the atom for the extra added electron:
X(g) + e

energy
Since energy is liberated during the process, electron affinity is expressed
as
a
negative value.
For example, when an electron is added to a fluorine

atom; 328

(F-), and E
is
5
328 kJlmol.
A
F(g) + e -F- (g) + E
=

328 kJlmol
A
Electron affinity is a
measure of the strength of an atom to attract an additional
electron: The smaller is the atomic size of an element; the stronger is the tendency to
form negative ions, and consequently the higher the electron affinity. Generally,
electron affinity depends o atomic size and effective nuclear charge of the elements
Aclivly 2.,9 "
Form a group and discuss the
following concepts.
1 _
Why does the electron affinity of Cl is higher than that of F?
2.
Explain why noble gases have extremely low (almost zero) electron affinities?
3
Explain why halogens have the highest electron affinities?
Present your findings to the class.
5. Electronegativity
Where d you find the most electronegative element in the periodic table?
Electronegativity is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract the shared electrons
in the chemical bond  The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901-1994) developed
the most widely used scale of electronegativity values based on bond strength: The
Pauling scale ranges from 0.7 to 4.0. Fluorine, the most electronegative element; is
assigned
a value of 4.0, and the least electronegative element; cesium, has
an
electronegativity value of 0.7 .
The electronegativity values for all the rest elements lie
between these extremes.
The electronegativity of an atom is related to its ionization energy and electron affinity
53
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
An atom with high ionization energy and high electron affinity also tends to have a high
electronegativity value because of its strong attraction for electrons in a chemical
bond.
Activily 2.70

Present your findings to the class
6. Metallic Character
In which region of the periodic table do you find metals and non-metals?
Metals have the tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions
As a result; metals
are called
electropositive elements:
In
moving down a group, atomic size increases progressively, and it becomes easier
for elements to lose their valence electrons and form positive
Therefore, metallic
character increases down
a
group.
In the periodic table, metals and non-metals are separated by a stair step diagonal
line, and elements near this border line are called metalloids. Metals are found on the
left side of the line and nonmetals on its right side.

As we move fiom left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons of the
elements increases.
But the number of energy levels or main shells remains the same
in a given period and electrons are filling the same energy level until stable noble gas

period from left to right; electron affinity increases due to an increase
in effective nuclear charge. The elements show a greater attraction for an extra
added electron.

Electronegativity: Across a period, a gradual change in nuclear charge and
atomic size determine the trends in the electronegativity of the elements.

Why d0
we need the classification of elements?
The main advantages of using the periodic table are:

The periodic table is useful for predicting the formulas of compounds. The

and

2
The periodic table is useful for predicting the physical and chemical properties
of elements. For example, radium is
a
rare and radioactive element and
therefore difficult to handle in many experiments. Since its properties can be
predicted from the general trends of group IIA elements, sometimes we do
not need to analyze it directly:

The periodic table is also
useful  for predicting the behaviour of many
compounds For example, oxides of the elements become more acidic across
a
period and more basic in character down a group. The trends in the oxides
of
'period-3 elements vary from strongly basic oxides to amphoteric and then
acidic oxides as

In addition to the group and period relationships, the elements of s and p block
also exhibit diagonal relationship. On moving diagonally across the periodic table, the
elements show certain similarities. Though clear upon examination; these diagonal
relationships are far less pronounced than the similarities within a group.
Diagonal relationship is particularly noticeable in the elements of second and third

Unit Summary
Early attempts of classification of the elements were made by Dobereiner and
Newlands.
Mendeleev's law states that properties of the elements are periodic functions of
their atomic masses.
Mendeleev arranged the elements based on increasing atomic mass.
Modern periodic law states that the properties of the elements are periodic
function of their atomic numbers.
Periods are horizontal rows, and groups are vertical columns of the elements in
the periodic table.
Elements in the same group show similar chemical properties.
Elements are classified as representative, transition, and rare-earth elements.
This classification is based on the type of sub-level ($, P, d,
or
being filled.
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost shell electron
from an isolated gaseous atom:
Electron affinity of an element is the energy released when an electron is added
to an isolated gaseous atom to form a gaseous ion.
Metallic character is the tendency to lose electrons and form positively charged
ions:
Electronegativity of an element is its ability to attract electrons
Trends in atomic size determine the trends in ionization energy, electron affinity,
electronegativity, and metallic character of the elements in the periodic table
Atomic Size itself is determined by the number of energy levels, nuclear
and effective nuclear charge.
Periodic properties of elements, such as ionization energy, electron affinity,
electronegativity, etc. show regular variation within a group O

Objective of the Activity
Scientists have identified different types of attractive forces between atoms in foring
bonds. The strength of the forces relies o the types of bonds. For instance, in
covalent bonds, the strength of the bonds depends
on whether the bonds
are
single, double or triple bonds
In this activity, you will use bundles of sticks to develop your ideas about strength
of bonds.

chemical bond is the attractive force that binds atoms together in a molecule, Or a
crystal lattice.
After the
periodic table and the concept of electron configuration were developed,
scientists began to develop ideas
about molecules
and  compounds
In
1916,
GN Lewis concluded that atoms combine in order to achieve a
more stable electron
configuration resulting in molecules o compounds
Historical Note
Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875
1946), introduced the theory of the
shared-electron-pair chemical-bond formation
in
a
paper
published in the journal of the American chemical society: In
honor of this contribution; we sometimes refer to "electron-dot"
structures as "Lewis structures"
G.N. Lewis

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
As independent particles, atoms are at relatively high potential energy:
Nature, favors
arrangements in which potential energy is minimized. Most individual atoms exist in a
less stable state than in their combined form:
When atoms form bonds with each other;
attain lower potential energy states
This decrease in atomic energy generally results in a more stable arrangement of matter:
When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, only their outer
are in contact.
In the process of the interaction, atoms achieve stable outermost shell configuration:
For this reason, when we study chemical bonding, we are concerned primarily with
the valence electrons. As described in Unit 2
valence electrons are electrons that exist
in the outermost shell of an atom:

Share your discussion with the rest of the class
Noble gas atoms with eight electrons (except
He) in the outermost shell are stable.
Thus, the ns2np6 electronic valence structure has maximum stability:
Atoms
containing
less than eight electrons in their outermost shell are unstable.
To attain stability, these
atoms tend to have eight electrons in their valence shells This leads to the
explanation
of the octet rule.
The rule states that atoms tend to gain; lose or share electrons until
there are eight electrons in their valence shell:
The type o characteristic of the resulting arrangement depends largely on the type of
chemical bonding that exists between the atoms These are ionic, covalent; and metallic
bonds.

cations and the negative ions called anions.
The chemical properties of metals differ from those of non-metals.

Ionic Bond formation
When two atoms combine, One of the atoms
electrons and becomes an anion
and the other loses electrons to form a cation  When a cation and an anion are brought
close to one another; an electrostatic force of attraction is set up between them: This
force of attraction between oppositely charged ions is called an ionic bond. It is also
called an electrovalent bond  The bond is produced when electrons are transferred
from the outermost shell of a metal atom to the outermost shell of a nonmetal atom:
To illustrate ionic bonding; let us consider the formation of the bond between sodium
and chlorine.
A sodium atom has
1 valence electron. In order to attain the electron
configuration of the nearest noble gas (Ne); it has to lose its valence electron and
form a sodium ion (Na+). Chlorine has 7 valence electrons.

The concept of Lewis formula representation can also be extended to covalent bonds.
The Lewis structure for a covalent compound shows the arrangement of atoms in
a
molecule and all the valence electrons for the atoms involved in the compound  It is
conventional to represent the non-bonding (lone pair) electrons by dots and the
of electrons that are shared between atoms by a dash: For example, consider the
hydrogen molecule:
The electron-dot formula of the hydrogen molecule is:
H' + HH
5 H:H
The covalent bond in hydrogen molecule is also written as H _ H
The formation of the covalent bond in hydrogen chloride is shown by the following
electron-dot formula. This formula must satisfy the octet rule (for chlorine) and the
doublet rule (for hydrogen) As shown in the illustration, these requirements are satisfied
The shared

Consider the fluorine molecule, Fz: The electron configuration of fluorine is 2, 7.
Thus
each fluorine atom has seven valence electrons.
Accordingly, there is only one

Note that only two valence electrons participate in the formation of fluorine molecule:

Thus each fluorine atom in fluorine
molecule has three lone-pairs of electrons. The resulting molecule is a diatomic molecule.
A diatomic molecule consists of two atoms. All the other members of the
halogen
family form diatomic molecules in the same way as fluorine does.
The maximum number of covalent bonds that an atom can form can be predicted
from the number of electrons needed to fill its valence shell For example, each member
of Group IVA elements has four electrons in its valence shell, and it needs four more
electrons to achieve stable noble-gas electron configuration: Thus, it forms four covalent
bonds for carbon in methane, CH4 as shown below:

In other words, a
non-polar bond is a covalent bond in which bonding electrons are
shared equally between identical atoms, resulting in a balanced distribution of electrical
charge.

CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
A
chemical bond in which shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of one
atom than the other is called a
covalent bond,
or
simply a
bond.
Polarity of bonds is caused by differences in the electronegativity of the two atoms
forming the bonds. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract the shared
electrons in a chemical bond toward itself
Elements with high electronegativity have a higher tendency to attract electrons than
elements with low electronegativity. For example, in the case of HCI, the electronegativity
of the chlorine atom is higher than that of the hydrogen atom: The shared
of
electrons is more strongly attracted to the nucleus of the chlorine atom: As a result;
the chlorine atom
acquires
a
partial negative charge (6
whereas the hydrogen atom
acquires
a
partial positive charge (8+). The delta is read as "partial'

b
How do you account for the properties of metals, such as conductivity, malleability, and
ductility in terms of the bonds in metals?
The highest energy orbitals of most metals are
occupied by very few electrons. In
s-block metals, for example, one o two valence electrons occupy $ orbitals in the
outermost levels (for example Na and
Furthermore, the p orbitals of the outer
most level are also
occupied partially in p-block metals (example Tl, Pb and Bi)
The d-block metals contain partially filled (n-1)d levels in their atomic states or principal
oxidation states The bonding in metals is different from that in other types of crystals.
The valence electrons of metals are not held by individual atoms. Rather;
are
delocalized and mobile (free to move throughout the structure _
The valence electrons form
a sea of electrons around the metal ions and these metal
ions are
organized as a crystal. Metallic bonding results from the attraction between
the metal ions and the surrounding sea of electrons
For example, as illustrated in Figure 3.8, a sodium metal crystal is a lattice-like
of Na+ ions surrounded by a sea of mobile
bonding valence electrons.

Properties of Metallic Bonding
Have you ever visited a goldsmith workshop? Why are metals easily shaped into
thin sheets and drawn
into wires?
The freedom of movement of bonding valence electrons is responsible for the high
electrical and thermal conductivity that characterizes the metals  Other properties of
metallic bonding contribute to unique properties of metals. For example, most metals
are easy to
shape due to their malleability and ductility.
Malleability allows a substance such as a metal to be reshaped: By hammering and
bending some metals, you can create thin sheets Ductility allows a substance to be
drawn or
pulled out into long thin pieces, such as wires
Metals are malleable and ductile because metallic bonding is the same in all directions
throughout the solid
When we apply a force to metal, its cations swim freely within the sea of electrons
without breaking the crystal structure. For example, when you hammer; bend, O1

Inter-molecular forces are
relatively weak forces of attraction that occur between
molecules. Inter-molecular forces vary in strength but are generally weaker than the
bonds that join atoms in molecules, ions in ionic compounds, and metal atoms in solid
metals Inter-molecular forces acting between molecules include: dipole-dipole forces,
London dispersion forces and hydrogen bonding: Dipole-dipole attractions and
London forces are collectively called Van der Waal's forces.
Dipole-Dipole Forces
Dipole-dipole forces are strong inter-molecular forces between
molecules. A dipole
is created by equal but opposite charges separated by a short distance. A
molecule
acts as a
tiny dipole because of its uneven charge distribution.
A
dipole is represented by an arrow with a head pointing toward the negative
and crossed tail situated at the positive

forces that exist between noble gas atoms and non-polar molecules. This fact is reflected
in the low boiling
of noble gases and non-polar molecules. Because dispersion
forces result from temporary redistribution of the electrons causing induced dipole-
dipole interactions, their strength increases with the number of electrons in the interacting
atoms or molecules. Hence, dispersion forces increase with atomic number or molar
mass. This trend can be seen by comparing the boiling points of gases (helium, He,

Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of intermolecular force arising when a hydrogen

Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of dipole-dipole interactions between
compounds In such compounds, large electronegativity differences between the hydrogen
and the fluorine, oxygen, O nitrogen atoms make the bonds connecting them highly
This polarity gives the hydrogen atom a positive charge. Moreover; the small
size of the hydrogen atom allows the atom to come very close to an unshared

Hydrogen bonds are usually represented by dotted lines connecting the hydrogen atom

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
Chemical reactions are the basis of chemistry. Chemical reactions occur around us all
the time. For
example, the burning of fuel, the souring of milk, metabolic processes of
our body and the decay of plants are some familiar chemical reactions in daily life.
A
chemical reaction is the process in which reacting substances, called reactants, are
converted to new substances, called
products. The characteristics of the products are
completely different from those of the reactants The conversion process is a chemical
change:
Reactants
Products
For example, if you burn magnesium with oxygen, the magnesium and oxygen are
completely  converted
to
magnesium  oxide
Magnesium  oxide is
a
soft; white,
crumbling powder: These characteristics of magnesium oxide are completely different
from the characteristics of the original substances, magnesium and oxygen. Magnesium
and oxygen are no longer present in the elemental form:
In summary, a chemical reaction has occurred in which the reactants, magnesium and
oxygen, underwent a complete chemical change, giving the product magnesium oxide.
All chemical reactions include three types of changes in the original substances These
are
changes in composition, properties and energy

change. For example
souring of milk" occurs due to the process of fermentation:

Present your conclusion to the class.
While investigating the quantitative relations between substances in chemical reactions,
scientists formulated the three basic laws of chemical combination These are:
The law of conservation of mass
ii)
The law of definite proportions
iii)
The law of multiple proportions
The Law of Conservation f Mass
In 1774, the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier performed an experiment in which he
heated a sealed glass container that held a sample of tin in air: He measured the mass of
the substances before and after heating and found them to be the same. This and other
similar
experimental observations became the basis of the law of conservation of mass
Historical Note
French chemist Antoine Lavoisier is considered the founder of
modern chemistry: He found that the amount of matter before
a
chemical reaction is equal to the amount of matter afterwards, even
though
the
matter
may change
in
its
form. Lavoisier also
experimented
with
the
role
of oxygen
in combustion
and
respiration in both plants and animals
Antoine Lavoisier
The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a
chemical reaction.
In other words, the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the
mass of the products, within the limits of experimental error: This law is also known as
the law of indestructibility of matter:
Mass of reactants
=
Mass of products
There is
no loss
or
of substances during a chemical reaction, and
mass is
conserved
For
example, consider the decomposition of mercury (II) oxide.
When 100 g of
mercury (II) oxide decomposes by heat, 92.6 g of mercury and 7.4 g of oxygen are
formed Note that the total mass of mercury and oxygen after decomposition is 100 g:

The Law of Definite Proportions
The law of definite proportions states that a compound always contains the same
elements in the same
proportion by mass.
This means that all pure samples of a
compound have the same composition regardless of the source of sample.
This law is
also known as the law of constant
composition. For example, sample of water could
be obtained from different sources, such as from a river; the ground, or the ocean.
But whatever the original source, all forms of pure water contains 11.2% hydrogen
and 88.8% oxygen by mass These percentages represent a ratio of 1.0 to 8.0 (1:8),
by mass, of hydrogen to oxygen:
This ratio is constant (fixed) for water: In other words, a
compound with a different
ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is not water:
Similarly, in forming the compound ZnO, 65.0 g of zinc combines with 16.0 g of
oxygen. This is 80.2% zinc and 19.8% oxygen, by mass.
As is the case for water;
the
composition of ZnO is constant: In forming ZnO, zinc combines with oxygen in a
definite proportion.
Experiment 4.2

The Law of Multiple Proportions
The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements combine to form more
than one compound, the masses of one element combined with a fixed mass of the
second element are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This law can be illustrated by
the two oxides of carbon: The two oxides of carbon are carbon monoxide (CO) and
carbon dioxide (CO2). In
1.0 g of carbon is combined with 2.67 g of oxygen;
whereas in CO, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 1.33 g of oxygen. By comparing
2.67 g of oxygen with 1.33 g of oxygen, it is found that the masses of oxygen in the
two
compounds that combine with the same mass of carbon are in the simple whole
number ratio, 2:1.

Present your conclusion to the class.
chemical equation is a shorthand representation of a chemical reaction in terms of
chemical symbols and formulas. In a chemical equation the starting substances are
called reactants; and the new substances produced are known as products.
Reactants are written on the left side and products on the right side of the equation:
An arrow
is placed between the two sides to indicate transformation of reactants
into products.

Generally, any chemical equation
must fulfil the following conditions:
1)
The equation must represent a true and possible chemical reaction:
ii)
The symbols and formulas must be written correctly: The elements _ hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine exist as diatomic
molecules These elements should be written as molecules in the equation:
iii
The equation must be balanced.
A chemical
equation has both qualitative and quantitative meanings
Qualitatively,
a
chemical equation indicates the types of the reactants and products
in the reaction:
Quantitatively,
a
chemical  equation
expresses   the relative number (amount)
of moles, molecules O masses of the reactants and products.
4.3.2
Balancing Chemical Equation
Which should be adjusted in balancing a chemical equation, the subscripts or
the coefficients?
According to the law of conservation of mass,
atoms
are  neither  created
nor
destroyed during a chemical reaction:
As
a
result; the number of atoms of each
element should remain the same before and after the reaction. Therefore, the main
reason why all chemical equations must be balanced is just to obey the law of
conservation of mass.
To balance a chemical
equation means to equalize the number of atoms o both sides
of the equation by putting appropriate coefficients in front of the formulas.
Only two methods of balancing chemical equations will be discussed under this topic.
These are the inspection and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) method
1.
The Inspection Method
Most simple chemical equations can be balanced using this method:
Balancing an
equation by inspection means to adjust coefficients by trial and error until the equation
is balanced.
Follow the
following four steps to balance the chemical equation:
Step 1:
Write the word equation.
Step 2:
Write the correct symbols 0 formulas for the reactants and products.
Step 3: Place the smallest whole number coefficients in front of the symbols or
formulas until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides
of the equation.
104
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
4:
Checking:  By counting the number of atoms o both sides of the equation;
make
sure that the
atoms
of all elements
are  balanced and also the
coefficients are expressed as the smallest whole number ratio.
Note:
When you balance an equation, do not change any
or formula of
compound
If you change a symbol or formula, it no longer represents the element O compound
required by the equation:
Example 1
Balance the equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to
produces magnesium oxide.
Solution:
1:  Magnesium + Oxygen

Step 2:

The LCM Method
In the LCM method, the coefficients for the balanced chemical equation are obtained
by taking the LCM of the total valency of reactants and products and then dividing it
by total valency of reactants and products.
All the necessary steps to balance
a
chemical equation by the LCM method, are shown by the following examples.
Example 2

the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

Exothermic and
Endothermic Reactions
Can heat energy be considered aS
4 reactant or
product?
Exothermic Reaction
chemical reaction that releases heat energy to the surroundings is known as an
exothermic reaction During an exothermic process, heat is given out from the system
to its
surroundings and this heat energy is written on the right side of the equation as
shown below.

Heat
For example, the burning of carbon with oxygen produces carbon dioxide and heat is
released during the reaction
Thus, the reaction is exothermic and written as:
C + 02
COz + Heat
Endothermic Reaction
chemical reaction which absorbs heat energy from the surroundings is known as an
endothermic reaction. During an endothermic process, heat flows into the system from
its surroundings and the heat is written on the left side of the equation:
Reactants
Heat
products
For example, the reaction between carbon and sulphur to form carbon disulphide is
an endothermic reaction because heat is absorbed in the reaction
C + 2S

The amount of heat energy liberated or absorbed by a chemical reaction is called heat
of reaction or change in enthalpy for the reaction: It is symbolized as AH:
Its unit is
expressed in kilojoules per mol

The change in enthalpy (AH) is the difference
between the energy of the products and the energy of the reactants.

For endothermic reactions, AH is positive because the energy of the product is higher

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced chemical
equation is known as stoichiometry: In other words, stoichiometry is the study of the
amount o ratio of moles, mass, energy and volumes (for gases) of reactants and
products. Stoichiometric calculations are based on the following two major principles.
1)
The
composition of any substance in the chemical equation should be expressed
by a definite formula:
ii)
The
of conservation of mass must be obeyed
(the mass of reactants equals
the mass of products).
4.6.1
Molar Ratios in Balanced Chemical Equation
From a balanced chemical equation, it is possible to determine the:
number of moles of each reactant and product; and
relative mass of each of the reactants and products
For
example, in the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water; 2 moles of
Hz combines with 1 mole of 0z to yield 2 moles of H,O. The equation also tells us
4 g of hydrogen reacts with 32 g of oxygen to produce 36 g of water: This can be
further interpreted as follows:

mass-mass
problems, the mass of one substance is given, and the mass of the
second substance is determined from the same reaction.
There are two methods for
solving such types of problems:

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
The mass-ratio method
In this type of stoichiometric calculation; the mass of one substance is determined
from the given mass of the other substance using the following
1: Write the balanced chemical equation:
2: Place the given mass above the corresponding formula, and x above the
formula of the substance whose mass is to be determined.
3: Write the total molar mass of the substances below the formula of each
substance.
(Total

mass
is
the

The mole-ratio method
The mole ratio is the ratio between the numbers of moles of any two substances in a
given reaction: In this method; the given mass is converted into moles, and the number
of moles for the
required substance is calculated. If needed, convert the obtained
moles back to mass.
Follow the steps given below to solve problems of mass-mass relationships by the
mole ratio method:
Step 1:
Write the balanced chemical equation:
Step 2:
Convert the given mass to moles and write the obtained moles and the
required quantity, x, above the formulas of the respective substances
Step 3: Place the coefficients as the number of moles under the formula of each
substance involved.

Set up the proportion.
Step 5:
Solve for the unknown value, x; and convert the moles obtained into mass.

Volume-Volume Relationships
In reactions
involving gases, the volume of gases can be determined on the principle
that
1
mole
of any gas  occupies
a
volume
of 22.4 litres
at STP (standard
temperature and pressure, STP; the temperature is 0PC and the pressure is
[
atm
It is also known that 22.4 L of any gas weighs exactly its molecular mass at STP This
volume, 22.4 litres, of a gas is known as the molar volume.
At STP
1 mole of any gas
22.4 L

volume mass of the gas
The
relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules
was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of different gases
under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain
number of
molecules This law can also be stated as the volume of a gas is
proportional to the
number of molecules (moles) of the gas at STP

Limiting and

Reactants
When all the reactants are completely consumed in a chemical reaction, then such
reactants are said to be in stoichiometric
proportions. But, practically these types of

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
reactants is encountered in the reaction and the other reactant is completely converted
into products. Thus, the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction is known
as the
limiting reactant; because it limits or determines the amount of products that can
be formed.
For example, consider the following reaction:
H
2HCL
1 mole
L
mole
2 moles
According to the equation;
1 mole of Hz reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2
mole of HCL Thus, all the reactants are completely consumed and only products
appear: However if 1 mole of H
reacts with 1.5 mole of Clz there is insufficient Hz
to react with all of the CLz: Therefore, Cl will be in excess and
will be the limiting
reactant: Only 2 moles of HCl are formed and at the end of the reaction 0.5 mole of
C1z remains unreacted

In our
to
activity, we are familiar with the chemical processes like rusting of
iron; burning of substances, breathing of air; digestion of food and so on. All such
types of processes
or
reactions
are known
as oxidation and reduction
or redox
reactions.
4.7.1
Oxidation-Reduction
Can oxidation take

Oxidation: is the process in which a substance loses electrons in a chemical reaction:
For example, in the reaction

Each sodium atom has lost one electron and has turned to a sodium ion.
Hence, sodium is oxidized

Reduction: is the process in which
a  substance

a
chemical
reaction.
For example, in the above reaction each chlorine atom has gained an
electron and has changed to chloride ion Thus, chlorine is reduced;
Clz
2e"
Cl
The processes of oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously because if one
substance loses electrons, the other substance must
these electrons. Since the
process of oxidation and reduction involves the transfer of electrons, it also results in
the changes of oxidation number: Thus, oxidation and reduction can also be defined in
terms of oxidation number. Oxidation is an increase in the oxidation number of an
element and reduction is a decrease in the oxidation number: For example, in the
reaction;
+1
=1
Na +
Clz
2NaCl
Reduced
Oxidized
The oxidation number of sodium is increased from 0 to
+1 and thus sodium is
oxidized. The oxidation number of chlorine is decreased from 0 to -1, and therefore
chlorine is reduced
4.7.2
Oxidation Number
or Oxidation State
Oxidation number or oxidation state is the number of electrons that an atom appears
to have gained or lost when it is combined with other atoms.
Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Rule 1:
The oxidation number of all elements in free state is zero. This rule is also
applied for diatomic O polyatomic elements

Example : OFz
Rule 4:
The oxidation number of hydrogen in its entire compounds is +l except
in metal  hydrides, (like NaH,
and
where its oxidation
number is -1.
Rule 5:
The sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a neutral compound is

Example: H,SO4
((+2) + (+6) + (28) = 0
Rule 6:
In a
polyatomic ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers of the constituent
atoms
equals the charge on the ion:
+6 -2
Example: (S 04)-2
((+6) + (28) =-2)
Rule 7:
Elements of group IA have +l and group IIA have +2 oxidation states in all
of their compounds.
Rule 8:
In a
compound, the more electronegative element is assigned a negative
oxidation number; and the less electronegative element is assigned a positive
oxidation number:

Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
In a redox
reaction; the substance that causes another substance to
oxidized, but
itself
reduced, is known as an
oxidizing agent; O oxidant: In the same manner;
the substance that causes another substance to get reduced, but itself oxidized, is
referred to as a reducing agent or reductant:
Oxidizing agents are substances that:
are reduced (gain electrons
contain elements whose oxidation number decreases
Reducing agents are substances that:
are oxidized (lose electrons_
contain elements whose oxidation number increases
Tests for an
oxidizing agent are accomplished by mixing it with a substance which is
easily oxidized to give a visible colour change when the reaction takes

Other common
oxidizing agents are chlorine, potassium chromate, sodium chlorate
and manganese (IV) oxide.
Similarly, certain reducing agents undergo a visible colour change with a substance
which is easily reduced
For example,
A moist starch solution changes potassium iodide paper to blue-black to show
that iodine is formed, 21
Iz: That is potassium iodide is a reducing agent:
ii)
Hydrogen sulphide bubbled through a solution of an oxidizing agent forms
a
yellow precipitate, S2
S. That is HzS is a reducing agent:
Other
common
reducing agents
are
carbon, carbon  monoxide,
sodium
thiosulphate, sodium sulphite and iron
(II) salts.
The oxidizing or reducing ability of substances depend on many factors. Some
of these are:
Electronegativity: Elements with high electronegativity such as Fz, 0z, Nz and
Clz are good oxidizing agents. Elements with
electronegativity for example,
metallic elements like Na, K,
and Al are
reducing agents.
Oxidation states: In a compound or ion, if one of its elements is in a higher
oxidation state, then it is an oxidizing agent: Similarly, if an element of a compound
or ion is in a lower oxidation state, then it is a reducing agent.

Non-redox Reactions
So far
we have discussed oxidation and reduction reaction
or redox reactions.
However; there are also reactions in which oxidation and reduction do not occur and
such types of reactions are known as non-redox reactions
In non-redox reactions, no electrons are exchanged between the reacting substances.
Therefore, the oxidation numbers of the atoms do not change in the reaction: Usually such
types of reactions involve the exchange of positive and negative ions Most of the double
displacement reactions and acid-base reactions are not oxidation-reduction reactions.

At what time does the reaction stop?
Every chemical reaction proceeds at different rates Or
Some reactions proceed
very slowly and may take a number of
to complete; while others are very rapid,
requiring oly a few seconds.
The rate of a chemical reaction measures the decrease in concentration of a reactant
Or the increase in concentration of a product per unit time. This means that the rate of
a
reaction determines how fast the concentration of a reactant O product changes
with time. The rate of a reaction is obtained by determining the concentration of
reactants or
products during the reaction: Methods for determining the concentration
of reactants or
products depend on the type of reactions. Some of the methods are:
a
Colour (changes in colour)
b
Pressure (increase or decrease in pressure, particularly in gases)
Volume (increase or decrease in size, particularly in gases)
Mass (gain or loss in weight)
Amount of precipitate formed
Generally, the rate of a reaction can be obtained by measuring either one of the above
changes in properties of substances and consequently relating to changes in their
concentrations during the course of the reaction:
Change in concentration of substance

Pre-conditions for a Chemical Reaction
Chemical reactions are usually explained by the collision theory: The assumption of the
collision theory is that chemical reactions take place due to the collision between
molecules:
1.
Collisions between reactants
The first precondition for a reaction to occur is the direct contact of the reacting
substance
with   each  other: However; all collisions  between  molecules
are
not
necessarily effective in bringing a reaction:
2.
Activation energy
If the collisions between the reactant molecules do not have sufficient energy, then no
reaction will occur: Therefore, for the reaction to take place collision must always
occur with sufficient energy to break the bonds in the reactants and form new bonds
in the product Thus, minimum amount of energy needed for the reaction is known as
activation energy:
3.
Proper Orientation
Collision of molecules with sufficient activation energy will not
a reaction if the
reacting molecules are poorly oriented  Thus, the collision between molecules should
have the proper orientation.

Consider the reaction between Hz and Clz molecules:

For the reaction to occur; first Hz and Clz molecules must collide with each other: For
the collision to be effective, these colliding molecules (Hz and Clz
must have sufficient
energy to break the H _ H and CL
Cl bonds and consequently to form new H
Cl
bonds.
Unless, the Hz and C1z molecules are oriented in proper positions, there is no product
formed. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4.13(c) the Hz and

Present your findings to the class
The rate of a chemical reaction depends on nature of reactants, temperature, and
concentration of reactants, surface area and catalysts.
The collision theory assumes that the rate of a reaction depends
on the number
(frequency) of collisions of particles and those factors which affect the frequency of
collisions will also affect the rate of a reaction. Now let us discuss each factor:
1.
Nature of the reactants
The rate of a reaction is influenced by the type and nature of the reacting substances.
For example, the following reactions have different rates due to the nature of the
reactants,
Fe and Cu.
+ 2HCI
MgClz + Hz
(very fast reaction _
Fe + 2HCI
FeClz
+
H2
(slow reaction)
Cu + HCI
No reaction
2
Temperature
An increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction. This is because as the
temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases which in
turn increases the number of effective collisions.
In general, for many chemical reactions, the rate of a reaction doubles for every 108C
rise in temperature.
3
Concentration of reactants
The number of collisions is
proportional to the concentration of reactants. The higher
the concentration of the reactants, the more collisions between the reacting particles
and thus the higher the rate of the reaction:
For
example, if you heat a piece of steel wool in air (21% oxygen by volume) it burns
slowly: But in pure oxygen (100% oxygen by volume) it bursts in to a dazzling white
flame. This indicates that the rate of burning increases as the concentration of oxygen
is higher:

Surface area
When the reactants are in different phases, be it solid, liquid 0r gas, then the surface
area of the substances affect the rate of the reaction: The higher the surface area of
reactants, the faster is the rate of the reaction. This is because more contact results in
more collisions between each small particle of reactants.

Catalysts
catalyst is a substance that changes the rate of a chemical reaction without itself
consumed in the reaction:
For
example, the decomposition of potassium
chlorate, KCIO3 into KCI and 0z is made faster in the presence of MnOz catalyst
2KCIO;
Meot
2KCI+ 302
catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction path
with lower activation energy: Lower activation energy for a reaction corresponds to
the higher reaction rate. Figure 4.16 illustrates how the presence of catalysts speeds

Chemical Equilibrium
In the
previous chapters, we came across chemical reactions in which all the reactants
are
completely
converted
to
products
Such types   of reactions
are  known
as
irreversible reactions. Irreversible reactions proceed only in one direction (forward
direction) and expressed by a single arrow (7)
Examples
2Na
+
Clz
2NaCl
2KCIO3
2KCI
+
302
However; there are many chemical reactions that do not proceed to
completion: The
products at the same time react to give (produce) the reactants
These are called
reversible reactions.
Reversible reactions take
in both the forward and backward directions under
the
same conditions.
A
double
arrow
or
pointing in pposite
directions is used in such reaction equations.
Example
Nz
+
3H2
The forward reaction proceeds from left to right and the reaction that goes from right
to left is the reverse reaction:
Does
a reaction stop if it attains
equilibrium?
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a chemical system in which the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions are equal. At the state of chemical equilibrium, there is
no net
change in the concentrations of reactants and products because the system is in
dynamic equilibrium: Dynamic equilibrium means the reaction does not
and both
the forward and the backward reactions continue at equal rates.
At equilibrium,
Rate of forward reaction
=
Rate of reverse reaction
The law of chemical equilibrium can be expressed mathematically using the molar
concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium: The concentration of species
is denoted by enclosing the formula in square bracket [ ]:
Thus, for the reversible reaction:

Rate of forward reaction

Factors that Affect Chemical Equilibrium
Adtivity 4.18
Form
a
group and try to explore at least two properties that can be utilize to determine
the state of chemical equilibrium in system:
Present your findings to the class
system remains at a state of chemical equilibrium if there is no change in the
external conditions that disturb the equilibrium But the
of equilibrium could be
affected due to any external factors like temperature, pressure, concentration and so
on. How a
system at equilibrium adjusts itself to any of these changes is stated by the
French chemist Henri Le Chatelier in 1888.
Le Chatelier states that if a stress is
to a
system in equilibrium, the system
will respond in such a way to counteract the stress The stress could be change in
temperature, concentration or pressure.
The factors affecting chemical equilibrium and their effects:
1
Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature changes o equilibrium depends on whether the reaction is
exothermic o endothermic. An increase in the temperature of a
will favour an
endothermic reaction and a decrease in temperature favors an exothermic reaction.
For example, consider the following reaction:
HzO(g)
+
CO(g)
Hz(g) + COz(g); AH
=
41 kJ
Since the reaction is exothermic,
1)
if temperature is increased, the system will shift to the left
ii)
if temperature is decreased, the
will shift to the right and a high yield of
products (Hz and CO2) is obtained.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
2.
Effect of Pressure or Volume
Pressure changes only affect equilibrium reaction involving gaseous reactants and
products. The effect of pressure on liquids and solids is negligible. An increase in
pressure (Or decrease in volume) on a gaseous
shifts the equilibrium in the
direction of forming smaller number of moles of gas. On the contrary, decreasing the
pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction of forming more number of moles of the
gas. For
example, in the reaction,
2CO(g) +02 (g)
2C0,(g
3 moles of gases
2 moles of gases
There are 3 moles of reactants and 2 moles of product
Therefore, increasing the pressure of the system shifts the equilibrium to the forward
direction: This results in a higher yield of CO_
Decreasing the pressure of the gaseous
mixture shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction
When the number of moles of reactants and products are equal, pressure has no
effect on the
equilibrium: For example, in the following reaction;
H
(g) + I,
g
2HI
g
2 moles of gases
2 molesof gases
the number of moles of reactants and products are equal (2 mol each) and hence no
effect of pressure on the equilibrium:

the temperature is increased;

Effect of Concentration
According to Le Chatelier'$ principle, any change in the concentration of a reactant Or
product will lead to a change in the concentration of the substances on the other side
of the equation.
If one of the reactants is added to the equilibrium mixture, the
shifts to the
forward direction and a high
of product is obtained. To the contrary, if more
product is added to the system, the equilibrium shifts to the reverse direction: For
example, in the reaction,
N2
+
If the concentration of Nz o Hz is increased (i.e,, if more Nz or Hz is added), the
equilibrium will shift to the right direction and more NH; will be produced
4.
Effect of catalysts
Catalysts  change the speed of both the forward and
reverse reactions equally:
However; catalysts do not affect the state of chemical equilibrium of a reaction This
means that the
position of equilibrium will not be shifted due to the presence of a
catalyst:
How can Le-Chatelier'$ principle help in maximizing the yields of products
in industrial production?
Many industrial reactions are reversible reactions The Haber and contact processes
provide excellent illustrations of the effects of temperature, pressure and catalyst o

What happens when you heat an ice cube?
You recall that all object around us is called matter: Matter is defined as anything that
occupies space and has mass. It can exist in the form of gas, liquid and solid. The
simplest example is the water we use in our daily life. The three physical states of
water are:
Steam; water in the form of gas
Water; in the form of liquid.
Ice, water in the form of solid
The changes of the states of matter are our every
experience. That is, ice melts
and water freezes; water boils and steam condenses.
The physical state of a given sample of matter depends
on the temperature and
pressure. Changing these conditions o variables may change the behaviour of the
substances as solids, liquids O gases.
Solid
solid has a definite shape and a definite volume. Solids are almost completely
incompressible and have very high average density: A high average density reflects the
fact that the particles within solids are usually
closer than those in liquids o
gases do. The tightly packed particles of solids are also highly organized
The particles of a solid, whether
are atoms, ions or molecules only vibrate about
a fixed point with respect to the neighboring particles. Because of these, the particles
maintain a fixed position; for example substances like metals, wood, coal and stone,
are solids.

Liquid
liquid has a definite volume, but does not have a definite shape. Liquids take the
shape of their container: This is explained in terms of arrangement of particles In the
liquid state, particles vibrate about a point; and constantly shift their positions relative
to their neighbours. At room temperature; water; ethanol, benzene and oil are liquids.
Gas
gas has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. This is because its particles
are
virtually independent of one another: For example, air; hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide and nitrogen are
Plasma
Besides, solid, liquid and gas, there exists
a fourth-state of matter at very high
temperature (million degrees Celsius). At such high temperatures molecules cannot
exist Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons. This state of matter; a
gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is called plasma. Because of the
extreme temperatures needed for fusion, no material can exist in the plasma state.

The Kinetic Theory of
Matter
The three states of matter in which substances are chemically the same but physically
different are explained by the kinetic theory of matter: The kinetic theory of matter gives
an
explanation of the nature of the motion and the heat energy. According to the kinetic
of matter; every substance consists of a very large number of very small particles
called ions, atoms and molecules. The particles are in a state of continuous and random
motion with all possible velocities. The motion of the particles increases with a rise in
temperature.
Generally, the kinetic theory of matter is based on the following three assumptions:
1.
All matter is
composed of particles which are in constant motion.
2.
The particles possess kinetic energy and potential energy
3.
The difference between the three states of matter is due to their energy contents
and the motion of the particles

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
As discussed earlier; matter exists as gas, liquid, and solid. Their properties are
explained in terms of the kinetic theory as follows:
Properties of Gases
From the kinetic molecular theory of gases, the following general properties of gases
can be summarized.
1.
Gases have no definite
and definite volume. This is because gases assume
the volume and shape of their containers
2
Gases can be easily compressed  By applying pressure to the walls of a flexible
container; gases can be compressed; the compression results in a decrease in
volume. This happens due to the large spaces between the particles of gases
3_
Gases have low densities compared with liquids and solids. This is due to the
fact that the particles of a gas are very far apart and the number of molecules
per unit volume is very small. A small mass of a gas in a large volume results in
a very low
density:
4
Gases exert pressure in all directions. Gases that are confined in a container
exert pressure 0n the walls of their container This pressure is due to collisions
between gas molecules and the walls of the container:
5 .
Gases easily flow and diffuse through one another:
A
gas moves freely and
randomly throughout in a given space.
Properties of Liquids
Liquids can be characterized by the following properties
1.
Liquids have a definite volume, but have no definite shape.
assume the
shapes of their container: Lack of a definite shape for liquid substances arises

2.
Liquids have higher densities than gases  Their density is a result of the close
arrangement of liquid particles Thus, the particles of liquids are closer than
those of gases This accounts for the higher densities of liquids as compared to
3.
Liquids are slightly compressible. With very little free spaces between their particles
liquids resist an
external force and thus are compressed very slightly:

Liquids are fluids. A fluid is a substance that can easily flow. Most liquids naturally
flow downhill because of gravity. Because liquids flow readily the molecules of
a
liquid can mix with each other:
flow much more slowly than gases.

Solids generally have higher densities than gases and liquids The particles of
solids are very close to each other: There is almost no empty space between
the particles of solids. This closeness of particles makes solids to have more

Solids are extremely difficult to compress This is because of the high interparticle
forces, and a very short distance between the particles

Solids are not fluids. That is

that solid particles are rigidly held in position by strong forces that cause the

Assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases
1.
The particles are in a state of constant, continuous, rapid, random motion and,
therefore, possess kinetic energy: The motion is constantly interrupted by collisions
with molecules or with the container: The pressure of a gas is the effect of these
molecular impacts.
2
The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the
gas. Gases are composed of separate, tiny invisible particles called molecules
Since these molecules are so far apart; the total volume of the molecules is
extremely small compared with the total volume of the gas Therefore, under
ordinary conditions, the gas consists chiefly of empty space. This assumption

The attractive forces between the particles are
negligible. There are no forces of
attraction or
repulsion between gas particles  You can think of an ideal gas
molecule as
behaving like small billiard balls  When they collide,
do not
stick together but immediately bounce apart:

The average kinetic energy of gas particles depends on the temperature of the
gas. At any
particular moment; the molecules in a gas have different velocities.
The mathematical formula for kinetic energy is KE. = 'Yz mv? _
where m is mass
and V is
velocity of gas molecules. Because the molecules have different velocities,
they have different kinetic energies. However; it is assumed that the average
kinetic energy of the molecules is directly proportional to the absolute (Kelvin)
temperature of the gas.

The first quantitative experiments o gases were performed by the Irish chemist;
Robert Boyle (1627-1691).
His
experiment helped to analyze the relationship
between the volume and pressure of a fixed amount of a gas at constant temperature.
Decreasing the external pressure, causes the gas to expand and to increase in volume.
Correspondingly, increasing the external pressure allows the gas to contract and
decrease in volume. This is shown in Figure 5.1.

was the first person to fill a

In 1787, Jacques Charles investigated quantitative relationship between the volume
and temperature of a fixed quantity of gas which is held at constant pressure.
This can be related to real life by using an empty balloon: Accordingly, if we take a
balloon filled with air and place it on boiling water; the volume of the balloon visibly
increases as shown in Figure 5.4(b). If we take the balloon and place it in the freezer

set up
absolute temperature scale, or the Kelvin temperature scale, with absolute
zero as the starting
on the Kelvin scale.
The  average kinetic  energy of gas   molecules is closely related
to the Kelvin
temperature. The volume of a gas and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional to
each other: For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature causes the volume of a gas
to double, and reducing the Kelvin temperature by half causes the volume of a gas to
decrease by half This relationship between Kelvin temperature and the volume of a
gas is known as Charles' law:
Charles' law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas

Thomas Graham (1805
1869)
an
English chemist; studied the rate of diffusion of
different gases. He found that gases having low densities diffuse faster than gases with
high densities. He
was able to describe quantitatively the relationship between the
density of a gas and its rate of diffusion: In 1829, he announced what is known as
Graham's law of diffusion
Graham's law of diffusion states that at constant temperature and pressure, the rate
of diffusion of a gas, r, is inversely proportional to the square root of its density;
d,
or molar mass; M.
Mathematically it can be expressed as:
or
d

What is the relationship between altitude and boiling point of a liquid?
You recall that liquids have a definite volume and an indefinite shape. They take the
shape of their containers to the level
fill. On the average, liquids are more dense
than gases, but less dense than solids.
As in a gas,
particles in a liquid are in constant motion. However; the particles in a
liquid are closer together than those in a gas. The attractive forces between particles
in a liquid are more effective than between particles in a gas This attraction between
liquid particles is caused by the intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole forces, London
dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonding)
Liquids are more ordered than gases because of the stronger intermolecular forces
and the lower mobility of liquid particles Accordingly, liquid particles are not bound
together in fixed positions

phase.
PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
In an open container, evaporation continues until all of the liquid enters the vapor
However; liquids in a closed container behave differently. The volume of the
liquid decreases for & period of time, and remains unchanged. In closed containers,
the vapor cannot escape.
As the vapor concentration increases, some of the vapor
molecules lose energy and return to the liquid state.
When
a vapor returns to the
liquid state, it is said to condense. The process is called condensation. Evaporation
and condensation are opposing processes.
Evaporation
Liquid
Gas
Condensation
The rate of evaporation of a liquid depends o three factors These are temperature,
intermolecular forces, and surface area of the liquid
An increase in temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the molecules and
this increases the tendency to change into the gaseous state. Some liquids evaporate
readily at room temperature. Such liquids are said to be volatile. The volatile liquids
have relatively weak forces of attraction between particles. Diethyl ether; ethyl alcohol,
benzene and acetone are volatile liquids
Non-volatile liquids have a little tendency to evaporate at a given temperature.
have relatively stronger attractive forces between their molecules, e.g , sulphuric acid,
water; and molten ionic compounds
Vapour pressure: The
pressure of the vapour above a liquid is called vapour
pressure. The vapour pressure of a liquid depends up on the temperature At a given
temperature, vapour pressure is constant: As the temperature increases, the vapour
pressure of a liquid also increases due to high rate of evaporation:
Vapour pressure depends also o the strength of the intermolecular forces between
the particles of the liquid The stronger the intermolecular forces, the lower the vapour
pressure will be, because
particles will have enough kinetic energy to overcome
the attractive force at a given temperature. For example, water and alcohol have
relatively low vapour pressure. On the contrary, liquids with low intermolecular forces
have high vapour pressures at room temperature. For example, diethyl ether; a non-
molecule with relatively weak dispersion forces, has a relatively higher vapour
pressure.

Boiling and Boiling Point

lower altitude than at a higher altitude?
2
Ice melts normally at 0'C. What happens to the melting
of ice in the presence of
impurities? Does it melt below 0PC, above 0C or exactly at OC? Explain.
What is the difference between evaporation and boiling? How does boiling
depend on the external pressure?
Boiling is the change of a liquid to bubbles of vapour that appear throughout the
liquids. It is the conversion of liquid to vapour within the liquid as well as at its
surface. It occurs when the
equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals the
atmospheric pressure. During evaporation only molecules at the surface escape into
the vapour phase, but at the boiling
the molecules within the liquid have sufficient
energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces of their neighbors, so bubbles
of vapour are released at the surface. It is the formation of vapour bubbles within the
liquid itself that characterizes boiling and distinguishes it from evaporation
If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the equilibrium vapour pressure also
increases Finally, the boiling point is reached  The boiling
of a
liquid is the
temperature
at which the equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals the
atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the
boiling
will be.
The boiling
of a
liquid can be reduced
as
lowering the external pressure,
because the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure at a lower
temperature.
If the external pressure is 1.0 atmosphere (760 mmHg), the boiling
is called
normal boiling
For instance water boils, at 100PC at 1.0 atmospheric pressure.
Thus, the normal boiling
of water is 100PC.

Boiling of a liquid requires a certain amount of heat energy to break the forces of
attraction that holds the molecules together: The amount of heat energy necessary to
about the vaporization of a fixed amount of a liquid at a fixed temperature to the

When a solid is continuously heated its ordered crystalline structure is disturbed The
particles attain their freedom of motion gradually and melting (Or fusion) takes place
where the solid is converted into the liquid state.
The temperature
at  which
a
crystalline solid is converted to a liquid is known as the melting
In contrast when a liquid is cooled, the molecules become closer and closer; and the
intermolecular forces of attraction become stronger and stronger: The particles arrange
themselves into
a
regular pattern in the liquid. This process is called freezing O
solidification: Note that the freezing
of a liquid is the same as the melting
of
a
crystalline solid This means that:
Both melting and freezing take place at the same temperature
Both liquid and solid phases coexist at equilibrium with each other at the melting
or
freezing
To clarify this, let us consider
which melts at 08C and water freezes at 0PC. Ice
and water coexist in equilibrium with each other at 08C as follows
melting,0*€
Ice
Liquid water
freezing,0'€
The amount of heat needed to convert one gram of a solid to a liquid at the melting
is called heat of fusion The molar heat of fusion O molar enthalpy of fusion
(AHfus
is the quantity of heat needed to convert oe mole of a solid at its melting
to the liquid state. For example, the molar heat of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ at
0PC. This is the amount of energy needed to break the attractive forces in the solid at
the melting
Melting requires the supply of energy; therefore, it is an endothermic
process.
During the process of solidification; an amount of heat equal to the heat of fusion must
be liberated: This quantity of heat liberated, which is exactly equal to the heat of
fusion, is called the heat of solidification or heat of crystallization:

vapour at the boiling
To understand state changes, we will consider the heating
curve for a substance given in Figure 5.10.
heating curve is a plot of temperature verses the uniform addition of heat: This can
be illustrated for a hypothetical substance, in which the temperature of the substance is
on the vertical axis and the passage of time during which heat is added to the
substance is on the horizontal axis. Figure 5.10 shows the changes in the temperature
and phases of a pure substance as it is heated, beginning with a solid and continuing

INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
History of Organic Chemistry
Before the beginning ofthe nineteenth century, chemists classified compounds into two
classes; organic and inorganic Those derived from living things (plants and animals;
were
classified as
organic compounds, while those that came from mineral constituents of the
earth or were found with non-living things are classified as inorganic compounds.
What was the basis of this classification? Early chemists believed that organic compounds
differed from inorganic compounds because
thingshada special *life force' within
them, which was invisible andhard to detect. According to the theory of *life force' , the
only source of organic compounds was nature itself (plants and animals). It was thought
impossible to synthesize them in the laboratory: This was because man could not add or
create the 'life force' within them.
The beliefin the *life force' theory continueduntil Friedrich Wohler synthesizedurea for
the first time in 1828.In attempting to prepare ammonium cyanate, NHLCNO, from the
reaction of silver cyanate, AgCNO,and ammonium chloride, NH,Cl, he accidentally
and surprisingly obtained urea, (NHJ)CO:

Urea
Urea was the first organic compound synthesized in the laboratory: The synthesis of
urea by Friedrich Wohler and subsequent synthesis of other organic compounds marked
the downfall of the 'life force' theory:
How do you
organic compounds at present and define organic chemistry?
Thecommon feature oforganic compounds is thatthey all contain the elementcarbon Organic
compounds are the compounds of carbon found in and derived from plants and animals.
They also include those substances synthesized in laboratories except the oxides of carbon;
carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, cyanides and cyanates
Besides carbon; these compounds contain a few other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, sulphur; halogens and phosphorus. The branch of chemistry that studies carbon
compounds is called organic chemistry This branch of chemistry was developed, starting
from the theory of 'life force' to the era in which synthetic organic compounds are used in
our
'daily lives. The number of inorganic compounds discovered and prepared may bein the
region of some hundred thousand.Atpresent, millions of organic compounds have been
discovered, synthesized, andused.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
The main reason for the presence of millions of carbon compounds is the unique property
of carbon called catenation. Catenation is the ability ofatoms ofthe same element to join
together forming short or
chains andrings.A few otherelements like sulphur; silicon
and boron show this behaviour; but to a much lesser extent:

do these compounds have different
properties? Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
Organic compounds are generally classified based on their functional group.
What are functional groups and what groups of organic compounds are known
on the basis of this classification?
The functional group is the part of a molecule or a compound that determines the chemical
properties of thatmolecule or compound. This group also determines some ofthe physical
properties of a compound. Based on the functional groups
possess, the most common
classification of organic compounds including alkanes,alkenes, alkynes,aromatics, alcohols,
aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters The common functional groups ofsome

What are hydrocarbons and on what basis do we categorize them?
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of the elements carbon and hydrogen
only. Hydrocarbons are subdivided into two groups, based on the type ofbonding between
carbon atoms, as saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Saturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon andhydrogen containing only
carbon-carbon single bonds. Methane, ethane, and propane are typical examples of this
group. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen possessing
one or more
multiple bonds (double or triple bonds) between carbon atoms. Alkenes,
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons are examples of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

Alkanes are saturatedhydrocarbons They contain chains of carbon atoms linked by single
bonds only. Every carbon atom in the molecule forms four single covalent bonds with other
atoms Alkanes have the general formula C,Hzn+z; where,n =1,2,3 _

Physical Properties of Alkanes
Doyou know which alkanes exist in the liquid, solid or gaseous state at room temperature?
What types ofintermolecular forces of attraction exist between the molecules ofalkanes?
Explain why the boiling points and melting points of alkanes increase with increasing
number of carbon atoms:
Atroom temperature, the first four alkanes, methane to butane, are gases; whereas pentane
(CSH,2) to heptadecane (C ,7H
are
liquids, and the alkanes containing eighteen and
more carbon atoms are solids.
Alkanes are
nonpolar organic compounds. Weak intermolecular forces called Van der
Waal's forces hold their molecules together: The strength of these forces increases with the
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
increasing surface area (molecular mass) of the alkanes. Since alkanes are non-polar;
are almost insoluble in
solvents like water; but;
are soluble in non-polar
solvents like benzene, toluene, ether and carbon tetrachloride.
The density, melting point,and boiling
of the homologous series of alkanes increase
as the carbon number increases. For alkanes ofthe same carbon number; branched-chain
isomers have lower boiling points than the straight-chain (normal) alkanes. The reason is,
as
branching increases, there is a decrease in surface area and the strength of the
intermolecular force, which, in turn, results in a decrease in
boiling point; e:g;, the boiling
points ofn-pentane, iso-pentane andneo-pentane are 36*C,28 Cand9.5*C,respectively:
Alkanes containing all the carbon atoms in one continuous chain are called normal o
straight-chain alkanes and those containing chains with branches areknown as branched-
chain alkanes.
Example
In alkanes (branched o1 straight-chain) each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to
four atoms with a bond angle of 109.59.

1.222.3
Nomenclature (naming) of
Alkanes
Organic chemistry uses a simplifiedand systematic way ofnaming organic compounds. The
names of alkanes and mostof the organic compounds are derived from:
a
'prefix- indicating the number of carbon atoms (listed in Table 1.3)and
ii) a-suffix
indicating the type of the functional group present in the molecule
The
following table introduces the prefixes that are used to indicate the presence of one to
ten carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain:

From Table 1.2,you can note that the names of all alkanes contain the suffix *-ane
which
indicates that their functional group is a carbon
carbon single bond  Thus, to name an

alkane, you shoulduse the
appropriate prefix that indicates the number of carbon atoms and
the suffix

For
example, to name the alkane CGH,4' use the _

the presence ofsix carbon atoms andadd the suffix
~ane
so that the name becomes hexane.

Common
Names   of Alkanes
Lower members of the alkane homologous series have common names. The prefixes used
in the common names are n- (normal), *is0-' and *neo-

INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
IUPAC System of Nomenclature   of Alkanes
Itis difficult to have common names for the more branched and complex alkanes. In
naming such alkanes, the more systematic, convenient and appropriate one is the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system: In order to apply
this system, itis very important to know the rules to be followed, what alkylradicals are,
and how
are named:
Alkyl radicals are obtained by removing one hydrogen atom from the corresponding
alkanes Their general formula is C,
where n = 1,2,3
The names of alkyl
radicals are derived from the names ofthe corresponding parent alkanes by changing the
suffix -ane to-yl.

Those alkanes containing four or more carbon
atoms have more than one structure. The existence oftwo or more chemical compounds
with the same molecular formula but different structures is calledisomerism
The compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures are
called isomers. Alkanes exhibit a type of structural isomerism called chain or skeletal
isomerism These structures differin the arrangement of the carbon atoms and hydrogen
atoms. To understand what isomers are, consider the isomers of butane

Alkanes are generally not considered to be very reactive organic compounds The name
paraffin for alkanes arose from two Latin words 'parum' meaning little and *affinis'
means
affinity. Thus, paraffin means little affinity This name was suggested because alkanes are
inert towards
reagents like acids, bases, oxidizing and reducing agents However;
undergo several reactions under suitable conditions.
The major reactions of alkanes are the following:
1.
Combustion Reactions: If alkanes are burned with limited supply of oxygen,
will form water and carbon monoxide and will liberate lesser amounts ofheat
energy Alkanes burn in excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water; liberating
a

Substitution Reaction: This is a reaction that involves the replacement of one
atom O a group of atoms by another atom Or group of atoms. Halogenation of
alkanes is a very
example of substitution reaction: This reaction involves
reacting alkanes with chlorine and bromine. The reaction of chlorine and bromine
with alkanes proceeds in presence of heat or sunlight: This type ofreaction is
called photochemical reaction The reaction ofalkanes with chlorine and bromine
proceeds in a sequence of steps. For example, let us consider the photochemical
reaction of methane with chlorine (chlorination):
1)
Chain Initiating Step: This step involves absorption of energy to generate
reactive particles known as free radicals.
free radical is an atom Or a
group ofatoms possessing unpaired electron A freeradical is electrically neutral.

Chain isomerism: This is due to the difference in the arrangement of the carbon
atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain:

Geometrical isomerism. This results from the difference in the relative spatial
arrangement ofatoms or groups about thedoublebond. This isomerism exists because
free rotation about the double bond is not possible To differentiate geometrical
isomers, we use the prefix *cis' iftwo Similar groups are 0n the same side of the

Addition ofhydrogen halides, HX (hydrohalogenation): Addition ofhydrogen
halide (HCI, HBr or HI) to alkenes leads to the formation of alkylhalides. The
product of the reaction can be predicted by Markovnikov's rule; which states
that
'when an alkene reacts with
ahydrogen halide to give an alkyl halide, the
hydrogen adds to the carbon atom of the double bond thathas the greaternumber
ofhydrogen atoms, and thehalogen to the carbon that has the fewer number of
hydrogen atoms'

Benzene
Benzene is the simplest aromatichydrocarbon: Its molecular formula is C,H
FriedrichA
Kekule, in 1865,suggested that the six carbon atoms ofbenzene are arranged in the shape
ofahexagon: He also suggested a resonance hybrid structure. He represented benzene by
the resonance structures (Figure 1.10) in which the two structures shown make equal
contribution for the resonance hybrid or actual structure.

Resonance structures of benzene:
The bonds in benzene are neither single nor double buthave an intermediate character
between those of single and double bonds. All the carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule
are same in length and nature. Since structure Ior II given above are not the true structures
of the benzene molecule, the benzene ring is written, in most cases, in its resonance hybrid
form as follows:

MI
The six electrons in thehexagonal ring are delocalized.
From structures I and II in Figure 1.10, one may think that benzene has three double
bonds and has the same chemistry as that of alkenes But; this is not true. Benzene and
other aromatic hydrocarbons are not as unsaturated as alkenes because the three double
bonds in benzene are delocalized due to resonance.
are more stable than alkenes.
undergo substitution reactions to afar greater extent than addition reactions, which is
a different characteristic compared to alkenes.
Physical Properties  of Benzene
Benzene is a flammable, colourless, and volatile liquid with a characteristic smell Itis
nonpolar and immiscible with water but miscible with non-polar solvents like ether and
carbon tetrachloride. It freezes at 5.4'Cand boilsat 80.4C. It is a carcinogenic (cancer
causing) substance. Benzene is a
solvent for fats, gums, rubber etc-, and is used in
the manufacture of dyes, drugs and explosives
Chemical Properties   of Benzene
Benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons are more stable than alkenes andalkynes due to
the stability ofthe aromatic ring: It neither decolorizes bromine water
in CCl,
noris
reactive towards cold potassium permanganate solution However; benzene undergoes
the

1.
What do you think is the major component of natural gas?
2
How can
petroleum be separated into different fractions?
3_
How are natural gas, petroleum and coal formed in nature? Can they be recycled?
A.
Natural Gas
The principal sources ofhydrocarbons are natural gas, crude oil and coal. Natural gas is
found in association with petroleum or alone. Itis found in underground deposits several
hundreds orthousands ofmetres below theearth's surface, whereitoriginated from the e
and decomposition of animal andplantremains millions of years ago. Natural gas mainly
contains methane (more than 90%), ethane, propane, butane and small quantities ofhigher
alkanes. Other gases such as, COz
Oz and H,S, may also be present in natural gas
The
composition ofnatural gas varies, depending on its place of origin. Natural gas is
widely usedas a fuel. Itis advantageous over liquid and solid fuels andalso other gases,
except Hz, due to its very high heat of combustion.
B.
Petroleum
The word petroleum is derived from two Latin words, *petra' meaning rock, and *oleum"
meaning oil. Thus, petroleum means rock oil. The term petroleum refers to a broad range
of fossil hydrocarbons that are found as gases, liquids or solids beneath the surface of the
earth:
The crude oil is generally found
with natural gas in the form of a dark-
coloured viscous liquid, which is a complex mixture ofhydrocarbons. Its composition
varies according to its place of origin. However; crude oil mainly contains alkanes,
cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It also contains organic compounds consisting
ofnitrogen; sulphur and oxygen in small amounts
Refining of Crude
Oil
Crude oil Or petroleum is obtained by drilling wells until the oil-bearing region is reached.
After the crude oil is brought to the surface of the earth; it must be refined before it
can be used.
Crude oil is refined or separated into several components by fractional distillation based
on the differences in boiling ranges of its fractions (Figure 1.11).

Mosthydrocarbons present in petroleum are long-chain hydrocarbons However; there is
a
very high demand forpetrol or gasoline, which contains hydrocarbons, composed offive
to ten carbon atoms Therefore, the amount of petrol obtained by fractional distillation of
crude oil does not satisfy the demand forit: To satisfy the demand and maximize the output
ofpetrol or gasoline, the process called cracking is carried out during fractional distillation
What does cracking mean? Cracking is thedecomposition of largehydrocarbon molecules
into smaller ones by the
application ofheat (thermal cracking O pyrolysis) or in the
presence of catalysts (catalytic cracking).

C
Coal
Coal is formed naturally by the decomposition of plant matter over several millions of
Itis nota pure form of carbon. Itis an important source of aromatic hydrocarbons.
Heating mineral coal in the absence ofair; or oxygen is called destructive distillation of coal
Or coking ofcoal. When coal is heated in the absence of air it gives volatile products and
coke. The volatile products separate into coal gas anda liquid, called coal tar when cooled
Aromatic hydrocarbons and many other substances are isolated from coal tarby fractional
distillation
Coke, which is a solid and relatively pure form of carbon, is usedas a fuel in the blast
furnace during the extraction of iron. It is also used to produce gaseous fuels, such as
water gas (mixture of H,and CO) and producer gas (mixture of N,andCO)

Nomenclature of Alcohols
An alcohol can be considered to be derived from ahydrocarbon by the replacement of at
least one Hatom by hydroxyl group. Hence, alcohols can be systematically named by
using the suffix -ol to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane name.

using different materials
Industrial preparation of Ethanol
Ethanol is manufactured industrially by:

proportions, non-poisonous and has an intoxicating effect Itisahypnotic (sleep producer).
Ethanol is a constituent of all alcoholic beverages Itis a
solvent for many organic
compounds that are insolublein water; such as paints, dyes, perfumes etc. Itisalso usedas
a fuel for cars and
spirit lamps, and to make denatured alcohol which is a mixture of
ethanol and other poisonous substance that has been added to make the alcohol unfit for
drinking Forexample, methylated spirit is a mixture of959 ethanol and 59 methanol.

indicates the functional group.
Unlike aldehydes, the

INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
Industrial application
Organic chemicals are used forthe manufacturing of a
number of industrialproducts
that have a variety of uses Some of these products include alcoholic beverages,
pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents etc.
A.
Alcoholic beverages
All alcoholic beverages commonly contain the alcohol known as ethanol The ethanol
content of all alcoholic beverages is not the same. Some beverages contain small
concentrations of ethanol while others contain higher concentrations These alcoholic
beverages can be eitherundistilled or distilled: The undistilled alcoholic beverages include
beer; wine, *Tella"
Tej' etc while ouzo, gin, brandy, whisky, 'Katikalla
and vodka are
among the distilled alcoholic beverages:
Beer:
Beer is one of the alcoholic beverages widely manufactured and consumed in
most parts of the world The common raw materials forits production are barley
andhops Although the types of beer produced in the world are very many, the
average beerhas alcohol content between 3-6 percent by volume.
Wine:
Wine is another undistilled alcoholic beverage. The mostcommon raw material for
producing wine are grapes In the production process, grapes are first crushedand
then steamed. The liquid derived from crushing is calledmust: It then goes to a
fermentation tank where fermentation takes place. Then itpasses to a settling tank,
where sediments are allowed to settle, and it proceeds from there to a filter The
clear liquid is cooledin arefrigerator and is pasteurizedas itpasses through aflash
pasteurizer Most wines have an alcohol content varying from 10-15% by volume.
Liquor: Compared with beer and wine, liquor containshigher concentrations ofethanol. It
is notpossible to obtain an alcoholic beverage ofmore than 159 alcoholby volume
through fermentations This is because the yeast cells are not able to stay alive in
alcohol ofhigherconcentration. To get alcoholic beverages with higherpercentages
ofalcohol, the alcohol mustbe separated from the solution by distillation:
The alcoholic beverages likeouzo, gin, cognac, whisky etc,are madeby distillation Different
types of liquors have different alcohol concentrations In most distilled alcoholic beverages
the percentage ranges between 30-45% alcohol by volume. However; some alcoholic
beverages like Araki are expected to have ahigher percentage of ethanol.
B.
Pharmaceuticals
Organic chemicals are used to manufacture
and medicines for various uses. These
drugs and medicines
are
collectively known
as
pharmaceuticals.
Some of the
pharmaceuticals are:
79
large
drugs
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
Analgesics:
These are substances that reduce
For example: aspirin and
paracetamol.
Antiseptics:
These are substances that help to prevent infections in wounds by
bacteria; for example, acriflavine.
Sedatives:
These are
'drugs that make a person go to
or make them feel calm
andrelaxed. Examples of such type of medicines are the barbiturates,
which include several important drugs.
Disinfectants:
These are substances used to disinfect something or to kill bacteria; for
example, Dettol.
Sulphonamides: These are medicines used as antibiotics.Forexample: penicillin.
C.
Soaps and Detergents
Organic chemicals are used for the synthesis ofsoaps and detergents. Forexample, animal
fatand vegetable oils are used for manufacturing soap. Fats andoils are naturally occurring
esters of glycerol and thehigher fatty acids Long open-chain alcohols and alkyl benzene
sulphonic acid can be used for the
production of detergents:
Soaps and detergents are substances used to remove dirt: They are also called surfactants
Or
surface active agents. This is because
reduce the surface tension of water and
change the surface properties
Soaps are either sodium or potassium salts ofhigher (long-chain) carboxylic acids Soaps
that are sodium salts are called hard soaps and those that are potassium salts are soft
soaps: Soaps are prepared by boiling animal fat O vegetable oil with a base. The reaction
thatproduces soap is called saponification.

Preparation of Soap
Objective:
To prepare soap from animal fat or vegetable oil.
Materials required: Animal fat or vegetable oil, NaOH, NaCl,measuring cylinder;
beaker; glass rod, Bunsen burner; filter paper; funnel, conical flask; and
test tube.
Procedure:
Measure 3 mL vegetable oil or 3 g animal fatandplace it in a 100 mL beaker; add
3 mL ofethanol and 3 mL of SM NaOH. Stir the mixture vigorously with a glass
rodand gently heat over a flame for 15 minutes or untilitturns in to apaste. When
the paste begins to form, stir very carefully to prevent frothing: After all the paste
has formed, set the beaker on the bench to cool. Add about 15 mL of saturated
NaCl solution to the paste mixture and stir thoroughly This process is called salting
out the soap. Filter off the soap mixture by suction filtration and wash the collected
soap precipitate with 15 mLof ice water:

Cleaning
The qualities of some clothes decrease when
are washed with water using ordinary
soap. In order to avoid this, other chemicals are used for
washing purposes that remove
dirt in the same manner as soaps.
cleaning refers to the use of different chemicals
that are capable of dissolving grease and other dirt stains in a similar manner as soaps
without the use of water: The most commonly used chemicals in dry cleaning are organic
chemicals such as tetrachloromethane, CCL
tetrachloroethylene; CLC= CCL;; benzene
and gasoline.
E.
Fuels
The term fuel refers to any material that is capable of burning to produce energy, heat and
light. Most fuels occurring in nature are organic compounds. However; some inorganic
substances like hydrogen, producer gas and water gas are also usedas gaseous fuels But,
the most widely used fuels atpresent are of organic origin. This includes petroleum which
chiefly contains alkanes Natural gas which is used as a fuel for stoves contains mainly
methane. Gasoline which is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines also contains
alkanes. Paraffin wax which is usedto make candles is anotherfuel to
light energy and
it is a mixture of alkanes
containing more than twenty carbon atoms Besides its use asa
constituent of all alcoholic beverages, ethanol can also be used as a fuel for internal
combustion
engines. At present,it is one of the substances that we can rely on foruse as a
fuel forautomobiles The use of ethanol asafuel is now practiced in our country by mixing
it with petrol. Ethanol and other plant seed oils can be classified as bio fuels:
Agricultural Applications
Organic compounds also play an important role in agriculture, specially to increase crop
productivity by controlling the damages caused by insects,rodents, fungi, birds and weeds.
So, organic chemicals can be used in the manufacture ofpesticides and herbicides.
What is the distinction between herbicides and pesticides?
Pesticides are the chemicals used for controlling the damage that can be caused by fungi,
insects and other pests that attack crops. Among the pesticides, Bordeaux mixture is used
as fungicide Other chemicals like DDT,aldrine, dieldrine, malathion are usedas insecticides
Herbicides are the chemicals that are applied on
agricultural lands to remove unwanted
plants or weeds. Some examples of compounds that are used asherbicides include paraquat;
diquat, ammonium sulphamate, ammonium glyphosinate, sodium chlorate etc.
Fertilizers: In order to increase crop productivity we use either synthetic O natural
fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers are grouped into three classes as nitrogen, potash and
phosphate fertilizers. Nitrogen is one of the essentialplant nutrients. Itis absorbed by
plants in the form ofnitrate ion, NO; . Nitrogen enables green plants to synthesize amino
acids and proteins, and itis also a constituent OfDNA molecules To provide nitrogen for

Unit Summary
The   "life force
theory states that
organisms (plants and animals)
have a
life force which helps them to synthesize organic compounds
and that organic compounds cannot be synthesized artificially by man in the
laboratory
Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds including natural and
synthetic ones:
Organic   compounds
are   classified based
on
the functional group they
contain in their molecules:
The functional group is a part of a molecule that determines the chemical
and physical properties of a compound.
Hydrocarbons
are
compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms
only:
Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds between carbon atoms
Unsaturated hydrocarbons are those containing one or more double or triple
bonds between carbon atoms:
A
homologous series is
a
group of compounds in which each member of
the group differs from the next member by
group.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons represented by the general formula Cn
Alkanes are named by
prefixes that indicate the number of carbon
atoms and the suffix
~ane
Isomerism
is the existence
of
two
or
more
compounds with
the
same
molecular formula but different structures: These compounds are called isomers:
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a carbon-carbon double
bond as their functional group.
Their general formula is CnHzn"
The suffix
'~ene' in their names indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.
Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a carbon
carbon triple
bond as their functional group. They are represented by the general formula
C
The suffix
indicates the carbon-carbon triple bond.
Alkenes  and alkynes undergo
mainly
addition
reactions
while   alkanes
undergo substitution reactions:
Aromatic hydrocarbons are compounds containing benzene
Benzene
is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon.
Benzene mainly undergoes substitution reactions.
The natural sources of hydrocarbons are crude oil, natural gas and coal.

their
functional group and represented by the general formula CH
Alcohols
are
classified depending
on the number of hydroxyl groups they
contain as monohydric, dihydric and trihydric alcohols:
Monohydric   alcohols
are
classified as primary (19), secondary (29) and
tertiary alcohols (39).
The names of alcohols contain the suffix
~ol
which indicates the presence
of _OH group in the molecule.
Primary alcohols oxidize to give aldehydes and then carboxylic acids, and
secondary alcohols yield ketones on oxidation.
Organic chemicals have industrial applications such as in the production
of alcoholic beverages and pharmaceuticals:
Organic chemicals are also used in the production of fertilizers, pesticides

Inorganic compounds are the compounds consisting of mineral constituents of the earth
or
generally found in non-living things The term inorganic compound refers to all
compounds that do not contain carbon: Although, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are carbon-containing compounds, which are
classified as inorganic compounds Inorganic compounds are mostly found in nature as
silicates, oxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, chlorides and nitrates, etc.

Oxygen reacts directly with almost all elements except the noble
and inactive metals like gold, platinum, and palladium Such compounds of oxygen
are called oxides. Oxides are binary compounds containing oxygen and any other
element (metal, non-metal or metalloid) Binary compounds are those consisting of

Acidic Oxides
Acidic oxides are the oxides formed by the chemical combination of oxygen with non-
metals. Thus, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. These oxides are also called acid

Generally speaking, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. Examples of acidic oxides
include carbon dioxide, COz' nitrogen dioxide, NOz' and sulphur dioxide, SOz:
However; it is very important to note that all non-metal oxides are not necessarily
acidic oxides. For example, carbon monoxide, CO, and di-nitrogen monoxide, NzO,
are non-metal oxides, but
are neutral oxides which will be discussed later;

Basic Oxides
Oxides that are composed of metals and oxygen are basic oxides But, all metal oxides
are not necessarily basic oxides; for example Al,O3 and ZnO are amphoteric oxides;
which will be discussed in part (C).
Oxides of metals that dissolve in water and react with it to form basic or alkaline solutions
are called basic anhydrides. There are metallic oxides which have basic properties but
are insoluble in water: These oxides react with acids to give salt and water:
Example
FeO
2HCI
HzO
The oxides of active metals, group IA and heavier members of group IIA, dissolve in
water and readily form bases. The term base is used to describe both soluble and
insoluble basic oxides. Some
examples of basic oxides are LizO, NazO, KzO, MgO,
CaO, BaO, and CuO.

There are oxides which exhibit both acidic and basic properties. These are known as
amphoteric oxides. In their reaction with acids, they behave as bases and, in their

Some other examples of amphoteric oxides are ZnO, PbO, PbOz, SnO, and SnOz:
It
is also important to realize that hydroxides which react with both acids and bases are
described as
amphoteric substances. For example, aluminium hydroxide, AI(OH)z; reacts
with both acids and bases to form salt and water So,
AI(OH)3, is amphoteric in nature.
What is the common characteristic f acidic, basic and
amphoteric oxides? Acidic
oxides form salts when reacted with basic oxides and bases. Basic oxides also produce
salts in their reactions with acidic oxides and acids. Amphoteric oxides form salts
when
react with acids and bases. Thus, acidic oxides; basic oxides and
amphoteric
oxides are
salt-forming oxides.

Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent: Its oxidizing power is responsible for
its effectiveness as an
antiseptic for mouthwash and cleansing wounds It is also used
as a
bleaching agent: When hydrogen peroxide is added to a coloured dye, the molecule
responsible for the colour will oxidize and s0 the colour will disappear: For example,
if hydrogen peroxide is added to a black dye (paint) that contains lead sulphide, PbS,
the black colour turns white.
This is due to the oxidation of PbS to

Phosphoric acid gives flavour to many carbonated beverages.
Definitions

Arrhenius Definition of Acids
The simplest definition of acids is suggested by Savante Arrhenius;
a Swedish Chemist
Arrhenius defined an acid as a substance that releases hydrogen ion Or proton; Ht
or
hydronium ion, H;Ot, in aqueous solution:
Example
HCIaq)
Htlaq)
Cl(aq)
O1,
HCI(aq)
HzO()
Hzot(aq)
C1(aq)
Some examples of Arrhenius acids are HCL,
HzSO_
45
HI, HBr; and HF For a
substance to be called an Arrhenius acid,
it should contain ionizable hydrogen.
Despite its early success and usefulness, the definition of an acid, first proposed by
Arrhenius has some limitations. The Arrhenius definition of acids
their behaviour
only in aqueous solution: In addition, it does not
why some substances show
acidic behaviour in the gaseous state and in non-aqueous solutions.
For example, when ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases are brought together;
react to form ammonium chloride as follows:
NH;
g)
HCI
g
NHACL
S
In this reaction, the hydrogen chloride provides hydrogen ion (O1 proton), Ht
which
reacts with NH} to form NH4
But, this happens in the gaseous state not in aqueous
solution. Due to the limitations of Arrhenius' definition, chemists tried to define acids in
a more
general way:
Bronsted-Lowry Definition of Acids
broader and more general definition of acids
was
provided independently in 1923,
by Johannes Bronsted and Thomas M. Lowry: According to Bronsted-Lowry definition;
an acid is a substance that donates protons, Ht
to some other substance.

In the above reactions, HCl in the first; HzO in the second and HzPO4 in the third
are
Bronsted-Lowry acids because
are
proton donors. Here it is very important
to realize that all Arrhenius acids are Bronsted-Lowry acids. However; the reverse
is not true because Bronsted-Lowry acids include substances that are not acids
according to Arrhenius.
Although the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid is more general than the definition
proposed by Arrhenius, it still depends o the transfer of protons However; the
presence of acids that are not proton-donors, initiated chemists to search for another
definition of acids.
b
Lewis Definition of Acids
In 1923, the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis produced a definition of acid
that extends the concept of acids even further than that of Bronsted-Lowry:
According to Lewis,
an acid is a substance that can form a coordinate covalent
bond by accepting an electron
from another substance.
In other words,
an
acid is an electron-pair acceptor: Consider the following reactions:
F_B +OF
F_B<_F
Lewis acid
In the above reaction, between BF; and F
BF3 acts as a Lewis acid since it
accepts
a
of electrons from F-.
The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Arrhenius concept of an acid.
This is because as the acid releases an hydrogen
H+
in aqueous solution; the
released proton or Ht accepts a
of electrons from
a
water molecule to form an
hydronium, H;Ot ion:

Hydronium ion
The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Bronsted-Lowry concept of
acids. Since Bronsted-Lowry defined an acid as a
donor; the donated proton
can be
accepted by a molecule or species that has lone
of electrons. So the
proton, Ht
is an electron
acceptor and hence
a Lewis acid. Consider the
following reaction
(g)
HzO (1)
NH4 (aq)
OH- (aq)
In this reaction, H,O is a proton donor and hence a Bronsted-Lowry acid  The donated
proton from water to ammonia, accepts a
of electrons from the nitrogen atom in
NH; to form NH4
as shown below:
H

H_NO + H

The Lewis concept of acids not only includes
Ht as an acid, but also ions or molecules
capable of accepting an electron
that neither release Ht in aqueous solution nor
donate a
proton:
Classification of Acids
Activity 2.6
Phosphoric acid, H}PO4 has three hydrogen atoms and it is a triprotic acid. Acetic acid,
CH;COOH, has four hydrogen atoms and is classified as
a
monoprotic acid. Discuss the
reason in your group and present it to the class
There are different ways of classifying acids;
can be classified depending on the
number of replaceable (ionizable) hydrogen atom(s)
contain per molecule as
monoprotic or polyprotic acids.
Monoprotic  acids
are the acids containing only
one ionizable (replaceable)

Acids generally have the following properties:
1.
Acids have a sour taste
Aqueous solutions of acids have a sour taste: Lemon juice and orange juice taste
sour due to the presence of citric acid. Citric acid is harmless However; most
concentrated acids are corrosive and poisonous. So it is strictly forbidden to attempt
to identify such acids by tasting them:

What is the reason?
Discuss your findings
in your group and present to the class
Acids can be classified as strong acids and weak acids depending on their degree of
ionization in aqueous solution, i.e., the extent to which the acids dissociate to form
hydrogen or hydronium ions when
dissolve in water
A
strong acid is one that
ionizes almost completely in aqueous solution: Examples of strong acids are HCIO4
HI, HBr; HCL;
and HzSO4: These acids dissociate to a very high extent as
shown below:

H+ (aq)
CL- (aq)
HNOz (aq)

An acid that releases few hydrogen ions in aqueous solution is a weak acid. The
aqueous solution of a weak acid contains hydronium ions, anions and dissolved
molecules of the acid
Organic acids which contain the acidic carboxyl group ~COOH, are generally weak
acids For example, CH;COOH, ionizes slightly in water to give hydronium ions and

In a car
battery, the electrolyte used is 35% of HzSO_
How many percent of it is water?
What do you think about the concentration of the electrolyte?
<Concentrated"' and
dilute"' are terms used t0 describe the relative amount of acid in
a
given acid solution:
A
concentrated acid contains a relatively large amount (percentage) of acid and a
small amount of water: For example, concentrated sulphuric acid is 98% H2SO4 and
2% water: Concentrated acetic acid is 99% acetic acid and 1% water: But, HSO4 is
a
strong acid and
COOH
a
weak acid.
A dilute acid contains a relatively small amount of acid dissolved in large amount of
water For
example, a diluted solution of sulphuric acid may contain 10% HzSO4 and
90% HzO.
The concentration of an acid is the measure of the number f moles of the acid in one
litre of acid solution and is expressed in mol/L. This unit of concentration is called
Molarity, denoted by M. Mathematically,
Number of moles of the substance dissolved
Molarity (M)
=
Volume of solution in litres
Mass of the substance dissolved in grams
Number of moles of the substance
=
Molar mass of the substance
For example, the concentration of 98% H,SO4 is about 18 mol/L. If one litre of this
acid is added to 2 litres of water to make 3 litres of solution; the concentration will
1151
CH;C
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
become 6 mol/L.
The new solution obtained is a dilute solution of
HzSO4: Thus,
concentrated acids contains a greater number of moles of acid while dilute acids contain
less number of moles of the acid per litre of the acid solution:
Example
How many moles of HCl are present in 0.8 L of a 0.5 M HCL solution?
Solution:

=
MV
=
0.5
M * 0.8 L
=

mol HCL, where
M is the
molarity, n, the number of moles and V; volume of solution in litre.
An important aspect of the property of acids is that
conduct electricity in aqueous
solutions, ie,, the acids are electrolytes The extent of conduction of electricity depends
on the amount of ions present in the solution: Thus, aqueous solutions of strong acids
are better conductors of electricity than the same concentrations of weak acid solutions.
The conduction of electricity through acid solution is also used as one
means of
identification between weak and strong acids.

and
scale
Expressing acidity as the concentration of H;Ot can be cumbersome because the
values tend to be very small:
A
more convenient quantity called pH is used to indicate
the concentration of H;Ot_
The letter pH stands for the French words pouvoir
hydrogene, meaning "hydrogen power" .
pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (hydronium
ion concentration
The mathematical expression is:
pH

The square bracket [ ] means concentration in mol/L.
To calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution from its pH we can proceed
as follows.

The pH of a solution can be measured using universal indicator solution, pH indicator
paper or a
pH-meter: When universal indicator solution O
indicator papers are
added to an acid solution,
develop different colours depending on the pH of the
solution. So, to identify the pH, we need to compare the colour developed with the
standard colour chart.

As the pH value decreases the acidity of the solution increases. For example,

that solution

Solution:
HCl is a strong acid and dissociates almost completely:

Hydrochloric Acid, HCI is present naturally in the gastric juice of our body and
helps in the digestion of food. Industrially, hydrochloric acid is important for pickling
of iron and steel (to remove surface impurities) before galvanizing and tin plating; It
is also used to produce aniline dyes, drugs, photographic films, plastics like polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), and to recover magnesium from sea water:
Nitric Acid, HNOz is used industrially in the manufacture of explosives such
as
trinitrotoluene (TNT) and trinitroglycerine, fertilizers such as
and NHANO3,
rubber; chemicals, plastics, dyes and drugs
Sulphuric acid, HzSO4 is the leading industrial chemical. It is widely used in the
production of sulphate and phosphate fertilizers  synthetic fibres, paints, drugs,
detergents, paper and dyes. It is also used in petroleum refining, production of metals
and as electrolyte in car batteries.

Arrhenius definition of bases:
A base is any substance that ionizes (dissociates) in
aqueous solution to release hydroxide, OH- ions. Arrhenius bases are mostly ionic
metal hydroxides such as, LiOH, NaOH, KOH and
Ba(OH)z: The dissociation of a
few bases is shown by the following equations:
NaOH (aq)
Nat (aq)
OH- (aq)
Ba(OH)2 (aq)
Ba2+ (aq)
2OH- (aq)
Bronsted-Lowry definition of bases:
A base is
a substance that is
capable of
accepting proton(s), H+_
Thus;
a base is a proton, Ht acceptor.
Note:
Note that not all Bronsted-Lowry bases are Arrhenius bases, but all Arrhenius
bases contain the hydroxide ion which is a Bronsted-Lowry base. This is because
OH- can accept a proton, Ht
to form water:
According to the Bronsted-Lowry definition, an acid-base reaction is the transfer of a
proton from
an acid to a base.

The Lewis definition is a more general definition than the Arrhenius and Bronsted-
Lowry definitions. According to Lewis,
a base is a substance that is
capable of
donating
C
of electrons:
In other words, a base is an electron-pair donor.
Bronsted-Lowry bases
are also bases according to the Lewis concept: This is
because for Bronsted-Lowry bases to accept a proton, Ht
should have a
lone
However; Lewis base include other species that can form a coordinate
covalent bond by sharing their lone
with substances other than a proton, Ht_
It is important to note that Lewis acid-base reactions include many reactions that
do not involve protons:

readily soluble in water; while others such as
Mg(OH)z are slightly soluble. Bases that are soluble in water are also called alkalis:
Bases
or alkalis show the following properties:
1.
Bases are slippery to the touch and have a bitter taste: Bases have a bitter
taste; feel slippery to the skin in dilute aqueous solutions   Strong bases such as
NaOH and KOH are very corrosive and poisonous. So
should be neither
brought in to contact with the skin nor tasted:

Both acids and bases are classified as strong and weak depending on their degree of
ionization (dissociation_
in aqueous solution:
Strong bases are those which ionize (dissociate) completely or almost completely in
water solutions. Examples of strong bases include hydroxides of alkali (Group IA)
metals and lower members of alkaline earth metals such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and

Weak bases are those bases which ionize (dissociate) only partially or slightly in aqueous

The double arrow shows that the dissociation of a weak base does not proceed to
completion. This means an aqueous solution of a weak base contains oly a small
amount of ions derived from the dissociation of the base and a large amount of the
non-ionized base. For example, a solution of ammonia containing 0.1 mole NH; per
litre of solution ionizes only to the extent of 1.3%.
Concentrated
and Dilute
Bases
Concentrated and dilute solutions are terms used to describe the amount of a substance
present in a given volume of solution  The amount can be described in terms of either
percentage or number of moles Concentrated bases contain relatively large amounts
of a base in a given volume of solution while dilute base solutions contain only a small
amount of base. The concentration of a base is the measure of the number of moles
of the alkali (base) dissolved in one litre of solution:
The concentration is expressed
in terms of mole per litre (Molarity).
number of moles of the base
Molarity of the base
volume of solution in litres
The greater the number of moles of the base per litre of the solution the
more
concentrated is the solution. For example, a solution containing ten moles of NaOH
per litre is more concentrated than the solution containing two moles of NaOH per
litre. The latter solution is more dilute than the former: Thus, both a strong base and a
weak base may be concentrated or dilute depending o the number of moles of the
base present per litre.
Precautions
when
Handling Bases
Strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide can attack human
skin, and even damage animal and plant tissues. That is why NaOH and KOH are

named caustic soda and caustic potash respectively: The word
"caustic  refers to
a
substance that can cause burning: Thus, it is very important to avoid the contact of
bases with any part of our body O clothing: Not oly strong bases but weak bases

in some
cells and to make soft soap.
Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)z: It is also called slaked lime or lime water when it is
dissolved in water: It is a weaker base than NaOH and KOH, and is widely used to
remove soil
acidity, to make mortar (mixture of lime, sand and water) which serves
as
binding material for bricks and plastering walls, to remove temporary hardness of
water and in
manufacturing bleaching powder: Its aqueous solution is also used to test
for carbon dioxide gas.

Since, the reactions of metals of

vigorous, it is advisable not to use the metals of Group IA for the preparation
of salts by this method:
Sometimes, the reaction of active metals with dilute acids to prepare salts may
not be as successful as
expected. For example, calcium sulphate is only sparingly
soluble in water: So in the reaction with dilute sulphuric acid, calcium tends to
become coated with calcium sulphate which inhibits the reaction from proceeding:

Depending on their tendency to absorb water from O release water to the
atmosphere,
salts
can
be   classified
as
hygroscopic,
deliquescent and
efflorescent.
Hygroscopic salts are those which absorb water from the atmosphere but remain
solid
Deliquescent salts absorb water from the atmosphere to form a solution. The
process of absorbing water from the atmosphere by a solid to form a solution
is called deliquescence.
Efflorescent salts lose their water of crystallization to the atmosphere. The
loss of water of crystallization by solid crystals to the atmosphere is known as
efflorescence.
It is very important to note that all deliquescent substances are hygroscopic,
but all hygroscopic substances are not necessarily deliquescent

The growth and development of plants is determined by various factors of soil, climate,
and by factors inherent in the plants themselves Minerals required by plants for their
growth and development
are called
plant nutrients.
For
a
soil to produce crops
successfully, it must have an adequate supply of all the necessary nutrients that plants
take from the soil. The required nutrient elements must be present in the soil in fors
that plants can use and also there should be a rough balance among them in accordance
with the amounts needed by plants  When any one of these elements is lacking or is in
excess of the
required proportion, the normal plant growth will not take
Elements required by plants for their growth and development are called essential
nutrients The elements considered as essential nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen;
sulphur; nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, boron,
copper; zinc, molybdenum; cobalt and chlorine. All these seventeen elements have
their own roles in the growth and development of plants. Depending o the amount

are said to be primary mineral nutrients  The roles of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
in the plant growth are discussed below:
Nitrogen is a very important plant nutrient: It is absorbed by plants in the form of
nitrate ions (NOz ). In the growth and development of plants, nitrogen is utilized in the
synthesis of amino acids, proteins, coenzymes and nucleic acids. The proteins formed
control the metabolic processes that occur in plant cells. Nitrogen is also involved in
the synthesis of chlorophyll to produce a deep
colour:
Phosphorus is an important element without which the growth of plants is impossible
It facilitates early growth and root formation;
maturity and promotes seed O1
fruit production Phosphorus is absorbed by plants mainly in the form of H,POA
and
HPO;2 - in small amounts Phosphorus has a role in the formation of some amino
acids and proteins, coenzymes, nucleic acids and high energy phosphate compounds
like Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)
Potassium is absorbed by plants in the form of the Kt ion: It is a component of
enzymes that facilitate the process of photosynthesis and protein synthesis It also adjusts
stomata movement: It is the most important ion in controlling the turgidity of plant
cells. It increases in the solute potential (sap concentration) within the cells which
leads to an increase in the amount of water that enters the cells osmotically.

Fertilizers
During the growth and development of plants, the plants consume the essential nutrients
from the soil. The concentration of these nutrients will decrease in the soil. If the
plants are specially food crops, the nutrients can be lost from the soil when the plants
are
removed on harvest: So for the soil to be suitable for the growth of plants in the
next round; the nutrients lost must be replaced.
How

What are fertilizers? Fertilizers are materials that are added to soils to increase the
growth;
or nutrient value of crops. Fertilizers are usually classified as
(natural) fertilizers and synthetic or artificial fertilizers.
Organic (natural) fertilizers are those derived from animals and plants. This includes
animal dung, urine and substances obtained from the decay and decomposition of
plants. These fertilizers provide readily available nutrients to plants after some
of decay and decomposition  These fertilizers can supply the elements nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium and various trace elements to the soil.
Synthetic or artificial fertilizers contain all three major plant nutrients i.e,, nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium, and are known as complete fertilizers.
A mixed artificial fertilizer may contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Such a
type of fertiliser is called
a
complete fertiliser: The term NPK is used to describe
fertilizers containing the elements nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
Examples of artificial fertilizers are ammonium sulphate, (NH4)SO4 potassium nitrate
(KNO3
ammonium nitrate (NHANO3), and diammonium hydrogen phosphate, DAP
((NH
HPO
The most important mineral nutrients that need to be added to the soil are usually
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. All the three elements are needed in
quantities
Commercial fertilizers are normally given a
'grade" , which reflects the percentages
contain of N, P and K by
weight  For example, a NPK fertilizer may be
described as 10.10.10 indicating that there is 10% of each element in the fertilizer: The
suitable proportions are best determined in relation to the tested fertility of the soil and
the requirements of the particular crop that is
grown on it: This means fertilizers
of the same
composition are not used for different purposes In nitrogen deficient soil,
a
fertilizer containing a higher percentage of nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium
must be used. In addition to this, all fertilizers are not used for treatment of all kinds
of soil. For example, ammonium sulphate is more suitable for use in basic soils than in
acidic or neutral soils.

Electrochemistry is
a field of
chemistry that deals with the relationship between
electrical energy and chemical energy It is
a field of
chemistry concerned with
processes that bring about chemical reactions (changes) using electricity o generating
electrical energy from chemical reactions Thus, electrical energy and chemical energy
are
inter-convertible.
The devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy or electrical energy to
chemical energy are called electrochemical cells These cells
can be classified as
electrolytic cells and galvanic or voltaic cells. Electrolytic cells use electrical energy to
bring about chemical changes that produce many desirable substances in our daily
lives. Galvanic or voltaic cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy: The cells
we use in flashlight batteries; wrist watches, cameras and car batteries are examples
of Galvanic cells. The reactions between the chemicals in these cells are responsible
for the generation of electricity:
Electrochemistry has practical applications in our modern world and in everyday life.
Electrolysis is used to manufacture metals like sodium; aluminium; non-metals like
chlorine, hydrogen and compounds like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite.

conductors.

Why do metals transmit electric current? What are the charge carriers in metals?
Metallic conductivity refers to the transmission of electric current through metals. This
transmission is directly related to the structure of metals. In atoms of metals, the
valence electrons are bounded very loosely to their respective nuclei and move very
easily throughout the metal. This means metals contain electrons that do not have fixed
positions and are relatively free to move. These electrons are called free electrons or
mobile electrons or delocalized electrons. Thus, the structure of the metals can be
regarded as a series of positively charged metal ions, O cations, in
a sea of
negatively
charged electrons

ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
The electrons entering the metal displace (repel) the freely moving electrons at the
of entry: The displaced electrons occupy new positions by pushing neighbouring
electrons ahead. This will continue until electrons are forced out of the wire at the
opposite end
metallic conductivity is caused by the flow of mobile electrons due
to
repulsion exerted on them from the electrons entering the metal from the source of
electricity: The charge carriers in metallic conduction are electrons. Hence, metallic
conductivity is also called electronic conductivity:
Non-metals are generally non-conductors of electricity, because they do nothave freely
moving electrons Graphite is a form ofcarbon in which the carbon atoms are bonded in
trigonalplanar fashion to the three other carbon atoms, to form inter-connectedhexagonal
as shown in Figure3.3. Electrons move freely through thehexagonal layers, making

called non-electrolytes. Ionic compounds are non-conductors of electricity in the solid

Electrolysis is a process in which electrical energy is used to produce chemical
changes.
This process is carried out in
an  electrochemical cell known
as
an
electrolytic or electrolysis cell.
A
typical electrolysis cell contains a source of direct
electric current; an electrolyte and connecting wires that join the source to the
electrodes.
Electrodes are strips of metal or
that allow electrons to leave or enter the
electrolytes.

chemically active or inert: Active electrodes directly take
part in reactions. Examples include zinc and magnesium. Inert electrodes do not
directly take part in  chemical reactions.
only
serve
to transfer electrons.
Examples include platinum and graphite.
The electrode connected to the positive terminal of the source is positively charged
and is called the anode. It is the electrode through which electrons leave the cell The
electrode connected to the negative terminal of the source is negatively charged and is
called the cathode. It is the electrode through which electrons enter the cell.
During electrolysis, the ions of the electrolyte migrate to the electrodes of the opposite
charge. The positive ions are attracted to the cathode and are called cations Since
the cathode has excess electrons, the cations will discharge by gaining electrons This
process of gaining electrons is called reduction.
The negative ions are attracted by the
positive electrode (anode) and are called anions. These ions are discharged by losing
electrons at the anode. This process of losing electrons is called oxidation:
Thus, the cathode is the electrode at which reduction occurs and the anode is the
electrode at which oxidation takes place.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
The reaction that takes place at each electrode is known as a half-cell reaction: Oxidation
half-reactions occur at the anode and reduction half reaction at the cathode. The net
reaction that takes place in the electrolytic cell is known as a cell reaction: This overall
reaction is also referred t0 as
an oxidation-reduction reaction or redox reaction.
So
electrolysis is a process in which electric energy is used to bring about an oxidation-
reduction reaction. It is also defined as the decomposition of an electrolyte, using electricity
The process of electrolysis includes electrolyzing aqueous solutions of electrolytes
However; at this level, electrolysis of molten electrolytes will be discussed
Electrolysis of Molten (Fused) Electrolytes

Here, it is very important to realize that the number of electrons gained by the cations

This   is
true
for any oxidation-reduction

Moreover; oxidation and reduction reactions proceed simultaneously: Reduction and

external influence. This reaction enables
a
galvanic cell to generate electricity:
Therefore, Galvanic cells
are electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox
reactions generate electricity:
convert chemical energy into electrical energy:
Galvanic o voltaic cells are classified into primary cells, secondary cells, and fuel
cells For this level, only primary and secondary cells will be discussed:
Primary
Cells
Primary galvanic cells are those cells that are not rechargeable. This is because the
electrode reaction as well as the entire cell reaction cannot be reversed on recharging:
Once the chemicals in the cells that serve as reactants are completely used up, it is
not
possible to recover them by charging the cells Examples of primary cells include
Daniel's cell and zinc-carbon (Leclanche)
cells.
The common feature of all
Galvanic cells is that
contain two electrodes in contact with an
electrolyte. The
electrolyte in a Galvanic cell can be in the form of a solution o a paste. The cells
containing electrolytes in the form of solution are called wet cells, and those containing
electrolytes in the form of paste are called
cells.
An example of a wet primary cell is the Daniell cell: It consists of a zinc strip placed
in ZnSO4 solution in one compartment and a copper strip placed in copper sulphate,
CuSO4, solution in another compartment. Each compartment is called a half-cell, and
the reactions occurring in each compartment
are called half-cell reactions.
The
solutions in the two compartments are linked by a salt
as shown in Figure 3.7.
The salt bridge consists of
a
delivery tube filled with warm mixture of conc. KCL
solution and agar solution, which is then allowed to cool s0 that it sets in the form of
a
Alternately, a porous barrier is used to separate the solutions. The zinc atoms from the
zinc electrode lose two electrons each and become zinc ions, Zn2t_
The ions enter
into the solution, and the electrons remain on the electrode and flow through the
external wire to the copper electrode. This situation causes the zinc electrode to be
negative and the solution to have an overall positive charge.
On the other hand, in the compartment containing the copper electrode, copper ions,
Cu2t, from the solution move to the cathode and
two electrons each; to become
copper atoms and deposit on the surface of the copper electrode. This condition
causes the electrode to be positive and the solution to have a negative charge.

What is the purpose of the salt
in Figure 3.72
From the preceding discussion, it is clear that the solution in which the zinc electrode
is placed has an overall positive charge while the solution in the copper compartment
has a
negative charge. Unless the two solutions are neutral, the cell cannot produce
electricity: Thus, the purpose of the salt bridge is to:
a
maintain electrical neutrality between the two solutions. In this process the anions
(negative ions) from the salt bridge diffuse into the solution containing the zinc
electrodes; and the cations (positive ions) diffuse into the solution containing
the copper electrode to compensate for the excess positive and negative charges,
respectively;

Another important application of electrolysis is the purification of metals like copper:
When first separated from its ore, copper metal is about 99% pure with nickel, silver;
and platinum as major impurities. In the refining process, the impure copper is
used as the anode, copper metal of high purity used as cathode, and copper sulphate,
CuSO4 solution and aqueous HzSO4 as the electrolyte.
When electrolysis is carried out, copper and impurities that are more easily oxidized
than copper; such
as
nickel, will go into the solution: Copper passes through the
solution and deposits on the cathode; while the impurities remain in solution Impurities
like silver and
are less easily oxidized and do not dissolve but fall away from the
anode as *sludge'_
The electrode reaction in the purification of copper is the following:
Anode reaction: Cu(s) _ Cu?+(aq)+2e-
Cathode reaction: Cu2t (aq)+2e-
Cu (s)
During the process, the size of the impure copper anode decreases and that of the
pure copper cathode increases.

considered as electroplating? Explain. Discuss in groups and present
opinion to the
class.
What is the purpose of electroplating?
Electroplating is a process of covering the surface of a metal (metal article) with a
thin layer of another metal. Using this process, metals that easily corrode can be
protected by a thin coating of another metal that resists corrosion. For example, tin
cans are steel cans with a thin
coating of
and chrome-plated bumpers are used for
automobiles Thus, the main objective of electroplating is to protect an article from
corrosion and to give articles a beautiful appearance. In the process of electroplating;
the pure plating metal should be used as the anode, the article (metal) to be plated
the as cathode and a solution
containing ions of the plating metal as the electrolyte
For example, to produce a silver-plated copper article, say a medal, one should
use silver as the anode, the copper medal as the cathode and silver nitrate solution as
the electrolyte (Figure 3.12).

Unit Summary
Electrochemistry is a field of chemistry that studies how chemical reactions
produce electricity and how electricity is
used
to
about   chemical
reactions in electrochemical cells.
Electrochemistry deals with the relationship that exists between chemical
energy and electrical energy:
Electrochemical cells include electrolytic cells and Galvanic (voltaic) cells.
Electrical conductivity is the ability of substances to conduct electricity
Metallic  conductivity is the flow of electricity through
metals;
and the
conduction of electricity through metals is due
to
the presence of freely
moving (delocalized) valence electrons.
Electrolytes
are substances that conduct electricity, either in
an
aqueous
solution
or in
a molten state.
The conduction of electricity through electrolytes is due to the movement
of anions and cations towards electrodes of opposite
and the charge-
carriers in electrolytic conduction are ions:

ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
Electrodes are either metal strips or
graphite rods.
An
anode
is the electrode  attached
to
the positive terminal of a direct
current source,
at which oxidation (loss of electrons) by anions occurs, and
electrons leave the cell.
A cathode is the electrode attached to the negative terminal of a dc source,
the negative  electrode
at which reduction (gain  of electrons) of cations
occurs and electrons enter the cell (electric current enters the electrolyte).
During electrolysis,
anions
move
to the anode and cations
move
to the
cathode.
The reaction taking place at each electrode (cathode
or
anode)
is said to
be a half-cell reaction.
Cell reaction is the reaction that takes place in the entire
Voltaic (Galvanic) cells are electrochemical cells in which a spontaneous
redox reaction generates  electricity:
convert  chemical energy
into
electrical energy
Primary cells are voltaic cells that are not rechargeable, and the reactions
taking place in them
are irreversible.
Secondary cells are voltaic cells that are rechargeable since the reactions
taking
in them
are
reversible.
Unlike electrolytic cells, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive
in voltaic cells
Electrolysis has important industrial applications such as in the production
of chemicals like NaOH, in the production of non-metals like Clz and
metals like Na, Al and in purification of metals and electroplating:

Aluminium
Occurrence
and
extraction
Aluminium is the most abundant metal and the thirdmostplentiful element after oxygen and
silicon in the earth'$ crust. About seven percent of the earth's crust is aluminium. Itis the
second-most important metal, after iron, in terms of consumption. Aluminium does not
occur aS a free metal in nature. Its
'principal ore is bauxite (AL,O;*2H,0) Other minerals
containing aluminium are orthoclase
(KAISi,O
AIF .) , corundum
(AL,0,),
beryl
ALSi;o
and china
(Al,Si,0j2H,O)
Aluminium is extracted industrially principally, from bauxite,Al,0,*2H,O,by the Hall
Heroult process or Simply the Hall process. In this process, first the bauxite needs to be
purified sinceitis frequently contaminated with silica (SiO,), iron oxides and titanium (IV)
oxide. To isolate pure Al,O, from bauxite, the powdered ore is first heated with sodium
hydroxide solution to convert silica into a soluble silicate.

Iron
Occurrence
and
Extraction
Iron is the second-most abundant metal next to aluminium, in the earth's crust andit is the
fourth most abundant element. It constitutes about 4.7%/ ofthe earth's crust by weight: It
is never foundas a free metal in nature. It occurs in nature only in the form of compounds,
such as oxides, carbonates and sulphides. The chief ores ofiron are hematite
limonite (Fe,O,-H,O) magnetite (Fe;0), and siderite (FeCO,) Itis also found in the
form ofiron pyrites (FeS,) which is commonly called fool*s
Iron is generally extracted from hematite
magnetite (Fe;O_
and siderite (FeCOs-
The extraction ofiron from its ores is carriedout in a blast furnace. The raw materials for
the extraction ofiron are iron ore, coke, limestone and hotair The furnace is charged with
a mixture ofiron ore, limestone and cokeat the top anda blast ofhotair is blown in at the
bottom. The coke burns to form carbon dioxide and the temperature approaches 2000
near the bottom. As the carbon dioxide rises up, the coke reduces it to carbon monoxide.
The carbon monoxide then reduces the iron oxide to iron metal. The overall reactions in
the blast furnace can be summarized as follows:

The iron obtained directly from the blast furace is calledpig iron. Itis impure and contains
about 2% silicon, up to 1% phosphorus and manganese, and traces of sulphur: These
impurities make pig iron brittle. When pig iron is re-melted with scrap iron and cast into
moulds, it forms cast iron
Wroughtiron: is the purest form of commercial iron. It is obtained by removing most of
the impurities from pig iron Itis manufactured by heating impure iron with hematite and
limestone in a furnace.
This increases the purity of the iron to 99.5%.
Wrought iron is a
tough, malleable and ductile form of iron:

Conversion of Pig
Iron
to  Steel
The relatively high carbon-content ofthe iron recovered from the blast furnace (pig iron
makes it very hard and brittle. The conversion ofpig iron to steel is essentially apurification
process in which impurities are removed by oxidation: This purification process is carried
out in a furnace at high temperatures. In the conversion ofpig iron to steel, three different
methods are used.
These are the Bessemer Converter; Open-hearth Furnace and the
Basic Oxygen Process
a
The Bessemer Converter: In the process of converting pig iron to steel, molten
pig iron from the blast furnace is transferred to a
cylindrical vessel containinga
refractory lining of MgCO, and CaCO,A blast ofhot air is blown through the
molten metal from a set of small holes at the bottom of the vessel The oxygen
passing through the molten metal converts silicon, phosphorus and sulphur to their
oxides, which then react with the lining to form a slag: The carbon in the pig iron is
also oxidized to carbon monoxide, So its concentration is also reduced. The
conversion ofthepig iron to steel by this process requires only 15 minutes However;
the reaction is difficult to control and the quality ofthe steelproduced can be
variable.
b
The Open-hearth Furnace: It has a large, shallow hearth, which is usually lined
with a basic oxiderefractory (MgO and CaO) The furnace is charged with a mixture
ofpig iron, Fe,O; scrap iron and limestone. A blast ofhotair and burning fuel is
directed over the surface ofthe charge to maintain it in the molten state. Impurities in
the pig iron are oxidized by theFe,O, and air: Carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide
formed by the oxidation ofthe carbon and sulphur; respectively, in the pig iron
bubble out of the mixture as waste gases.

Basic Oxygen Process: This newer procedure has largely replaced the open
hearth, because of its high speed. It involves forcing a mixture of powdered
calcium oxide, CaO, and oxygen gas directly into the surface of the molten
pig iron.
The oxygen reacts exothermically with carbon, sulphur; silicon,
phosphorus and impurity metals. Carbon and sulphur are oxidized to CO

SOz, respectively, and are released as exhaust gases. The oxides of silicon

used as a structural metal in the construction ofbuildings and bridges In the form ofpig
iron, itis used to make domestic boilers, hot-waterradiators, railings, waterpipes, castings,
and
mouldings As wroughtiron, itis used in making nails,sheets, horseshoes, ornamental
gates, doorknockers, farm machinery etc. Iron is also used in the manufacture ofalloys
such as carbon steels and alloy steels Carbon steels can be classifiedas mild steel,medium
steel and high-carbon steel, based on the amount of carbon:
Mild Steel: contains up to 0.2% carbon and is used in making screws,motors, car batteries,
railway lines, ships, bridges, nuts and bolts
Medium Steel: contains 0.3-0.6% carbon and is used to make springs and chains.
High-Carbon Steel: contains 0.6-1.5% carbon and is used to make drill bits, knives,
hammers and chisels.
Alloy Steel: contains iron and arelatively higher percentage of other metals. For example,
stainless steel contains chromium (14-1 8%) andnickel (7_9%/): Tool steels include tungsten
steel and manganese steel. These metals give the alloy hardness, toughness and heat
resistance. They are used in rock drills, cutting edges andparts of machinery that are
subjected to heavy wear:

exists as malachite
(CuCO; Cu(OH)))
Copper is principally extracted from chalcopyrite. Since the amountof copperin the ore is
very small, the crushedand ground sulphide ore is first concentrated by froth flotation: This
treatment changes the concentration ofthe ore from 2 % copper to ashigh as 30% copper:
The concentrated ore is then roasted with a limited supply ofair (oxygen).

about 80% by volume of the atmosphere. In the form of compounds, it exists as sodium
nitrate (Chile salt peter, NaNO
and potassium nitrate (KNO,) also called saltpetre. It is
also found in DNA molecules and proteins ofall

temperatures compared to nitrogen and oxygen. As the temperature continues to decrease,
the air
containingmainly nitrogen and oxygen condenses to give apale-blue liquid Nitrogen
is thus separated on an industrial scale by fractional distillation ofliquid air: When liquid air
is fractionally distilled, nitrogen is collected and stored in steel cylinders under pressure.
The second fraction consists ofargon, which distils off the mixture at-1869C,leaving
behind a blue liquid of oxygen that boils at-183*€.

Phosphorus
Occurrence
and Extraction
Does phosphorus exist in the pure form (elemental state) as does nitrogen?   If not,
why? Phosphorus is a relatively abundant element, ranking 12th in the earth's crust. It
exists naturally oly in the combined state, such as in rock phosphate,
(PO4)2
fluoroapatite,
(POA)GFz or
(PO4z CaFz-
It is also found in teeth; bones and
DNA
What is allotropy? What are the two common allotropes of phosphorus?
Allotropes are different forms of the same element with the same physical state but with
different physical properties This is due to the difference in the arrangement ofatoms.
The two common allotropic forms ofphosphorusare white phosphorus andred phosphorus:
White phosphorus is a very poisonous, white waxy-looking substance thatmeltsat 44.18C

Oxygen
Occurrence and Production
Oxygen is the mostabundantelement on earth. It constitutes about 46.6% by weight ofthe
earth's crust in the form of compounds such as oxides, silicates, carbonates, phosphates
etc. It exists in nature in the elemental state in atmospheric air constituting about 20% by
volume. Oxygen is manufactured industrially by the fractional distillation ofliquidairin a
way similar to that ofnitrogen.
Chemical Properties  of Oxygen
Oxygen is relatively reactive and combines directly with most elements to form oxides
Oxygen combines with metal to form metal oxides (basic oxides). For example,

Sulphur
Occurrence
and
Extraction
Sulphur is found in nature and in the form of compounds such as galena (PbS) pyrites
(FeSz) (fool s
), cinnabar (HgS), sphalerite (ZnS) , gypsum (CaSO4 2H,O), barite
(BaSO4), and as hydrogen sulphide (H,S) in natural gas and crude oil.
Sulphuris extracted from underground deposits of elemental sulphurby the Frasch process
(Figure 4.6). In this process, three concentric pipes are sent down to the sulphur deposit:
Superheated water at about 170*C is pumped through the outermost pipes Hot air is
compressed in the innermost tube. A froth of sulphur, airand water come out to the surface
ofthe earth forced by hot compressed air in the middle tube. The molten sulphur is then
cooled and solidified.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
Uses: Nearly one-half ofthe sulphur needed by chemical industries is obtainedasa waste
product of other industrial processes For example, sulphur can be obtained in the form of
hydrogen sulphide (H,S) from natural gas and during the purification of crude oil. Itcan
also be obtainedin the form ofsulphur dioxide from theroasting ofsulphide ores during the
manufacture ofmetals. The use ofsulphur obtained from waste products ofother industries
reduces the demand for the element from natural deposits. This also reduces the pollution
ofatmospheric air and the formation ofacidrain.
Sulphur exhibits allotropy: The most important allotropes ofsulphur are rhombic and
monoclinic sulphur: Rhombic sulphur is the moststable form ofsulphur consisting ofS:
molecules.

Occurrence
and Extraction
Chlorine belongs to group VIIA, known as thehalogens It is the most abundant element
among the halogens  Itis found in nature in the form ofcompounds only. Chlorine is found
in nature chiefly in the form of chlorides ofsodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.
Sodium chloride is the chief source of chlorine, and it is obtained from seawater Or aS
deposits ofrock salt:
Commercially, chlorine is manufacturedby the electrolysis ofa concentrated aqueous solution
ofsodium chloride. During electrolysis ofthe concentrated solution, chlorine is formedat
the anode and the reduction of water occurs at the cathode, producing hydrogen gas and
hydroxide ions (OH- ) The electrode and the overall cell reactions are as follows:

Can glass be recycled; how?
Submit your findings to your teacher:
Glass
Glass is an amorphous or non-crystalline solid material. Almostall glass contains silica as
the main component: Quartz glass is made by melting pure silica, SiO_ ata temperature of
about 2300PCand then pouring the molten viscous liquid into moulds Itis ofhigh strength,
low thermal expansion and highly transparent;
Soda-lime glass is ordinary glass which is amixture ofsodium silicate and calcium silicate.
It is made by heating a mixture ofsilica sand, sodium carbonate O1 sodium sulphate and
limestone. The reactions that take place in forming soda-lime glass are the following:
NazCO3
Si02
NazSiO3
CaCO3
Si0z
CaSiO3
Soda-lime glass accounts for about 90% ofmanufactured glass This type ofglass is widely
used for window panes, bottles, dishes etc.
Borosilicate glass is commonly known as Pyrex. It is manufactured using boron
III)
oxide, B,O, instead oflimestoneor calcium oxide This glasshashigh resistance to chemical
corrosion and temperature changes and is widely used to make ovenware and laboratory
equipment such as flasks, beakers, and test tubes.
Steps in glass production
1)
Batch preparation: refers to the preparation ofthe raw materials according to the
appropriate combinations The raw materials are mixed in a proportion of 60%
sand,21% sodium carbonate and 19% limestone.
ii)
Glass melting: The raw materials and recycled glass (according to their colour)
are fed into a glass-melting furnace. The materials are then heated to a temperature
ofabout 1600*C to form a molten viscous liquid. Why are glasses is separated
according to the colour?
The furnace operates continuously, producing glass 24 hours a day: Substances that
give the glass different colours or improved chemical and physical properties such
as transparency; thermal and chemical
stability and mechanical strength are added

Ceramics
Activity 4.16

Are you familiar with the pottery industry? Do you know any ceramic factories in
Ethiopia?
3. Prepare a list of ceramic products used in daily life:
Discuss in groups and give presentation to the class
Ceramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solidprepared by the action ofheat and subsequent
cooling: Traditional ceramics, such as porcelain, tiles andpottery are formed from minerals
such as clay, talc and feldspar: Most industrial ceramics, however; are formed from
extremely pure powders of specialty chemicals, such as silicon carbide, alumina, barium
titanate, and titanium carbide.
Manufacturing of ceramics
The minerals used to make ceramics are
out ofthe earth and are then crushed and
ground into a fine powder: Manufacturers often purify this powderby mixingit in a solution
and
allowing a chemical precipitate (a uniform solid that forms within a solution) to
form. The precipitate is then separated from the solution: The powder is heated to drive off
impurities including water:
The processes of manufacturing ceramics include:
Moulding: After purification, small amounts ofwax are often addedto bind the ceramic
powder and make it more workable. Plastics may also be added to the powder to
give the desired pliability and softness The powder can then be shaped into different
objects by various moulding processes.
B
Densification: The process of densification uses intenseheat to condense a ceramic
object into a strong, dense product. After being moulded, the ceramic object is
heated in an electric furnace to temperatures between 1000PC and 1700PC. As the
2151
cycle
dug
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
ceramic heats, the powder particles coalesce, much as water droplets join at room
temperature. As the ceramic particles merge, the object becomes increasingly dense;
shrinking by up to 20 percent ofits originalsize. The
ofthis
heating process is
to maximize the strength ofceramicby obtainingan internal structure that is compact
and extremely dense.
In general, most ceramics are hard and wear-resistant; brittle, refractory, thermal and
electrical insulators, non-magnetic, oxidation-resistant,and chemically stable.
Due to the wide range of
'properties of ceramic materials,
are used for a multitude of
applications
Well-known uses of ceramics: They are commonly found in art sculptures, dishes,
platters and otherkitchenware, kitchen tiles and bath room structures.
Lesser-known uses for ceramics:
are used as electrical insulators,
computers parts, tools, dental replacements,engine parts,and tiles on space shuttles
and to replace bones such as the bones in hips, knees and shoulders
Future uses of ceramics: In future, the ceramics might be used to remove impurities
from the drinking water, and to replace diseasedheart valves

Sugarcane is aperennial herb belonging to the grass family Native to tropical andsubtropical
regions ofthe world, this tropical grass is about 3 metres tall.
Planting: Sugarcane is planted in fields by workers or mechanical planters Typical cane
soil is made from the mixture of silts, clay particles and organic matter: Fertilizers are
applied from the time ofplanting up until thebeginning ofthe ripeningperiod, dependingon
the region where the crop is planted. Cane seasons last from 8-22 months.
1.
Collecting the Harvest: Mature canes are gathered by a combination ofmanual
and mechanical methods. The cane is cut at ground level, the leaves are removed,
the top is trimmed off (by cutting off the last mature joint) the canes and transported
to a sugar factory:
2
Cleansing and Grinding: The stalks are thoroughly washed and cut at the sugar
mill. After the
'cleaning process,a machine led by a series ofrotating knives,shreds
6
the cane into pieces This is known as "grinding
During grinding, hot water is
sprayed onto the sugarcane to dissolve the remaining hard sugar: The shredded
cane is then spread out on a conveyer belt;
3.
Juicing: The shredded sugarcane travels on the conveyor belt through a series of
heavy-duty rollers, whichextractjuice fiomthepulp Thepulpthatremains,or "bagasse "
is dried and usedas a fuel The raw juice moves on through the mill to beclarified
4.
Clarifying: Carbon dioxide and milk oflime are added to theliquid sugar mixture,
which is heated until boiling: The process ofclarifying begins at this stage.As the
carbon dioxide moves through the liquid, it forms calcium carbonate, which attracts
non-sugar debris (fats, gums and waxes) from the juice, andpulls them away from
the sugar juice. The juice is then pushed through a series of filters to remove any
remaining impurities
5.
Evaporation: The clearjuice thatresults from the clarifying process is put under a
vacuum, where the juice boils at a low temperature and the water in it begins to
evaporate. It is heateduntil it forms into thick, brown syrup.
6.
Crystallization: Crystallization is the process of evaporating the water from the
sugar syrup. Pulverized sugar is fed into a sterilized vacuum pan. As the liquid
evaporates, crystals form: The remaining mixture is a thick mass oflarge crystals
These crystals are sent to a centrifuge that spins and dries them. The dried product
is raw sugar , which is edible.
7.
Refinery: Raw sugar is transported to a cane sugar refinery for the removal of
molasses, minerals and othernon-sugars that contaminate it: This is known as the
purification process. Raw sugaris mixed with a solution ofsugarand water to loosen
the molasses from the outside ofthe raw sugar crystals, producing a thick matter
known as "magma" . Large machines then spin the magma, separating the molasses
from the crystals. The crystals are promptly washed, dissolvedand filtered to remove
impurities. The golden syrup that is produced is then sent through filters, and SO_is

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
passed through itto remove the colour and water: The process ofremoving colour
is known as bleaching What is left is concentrated, clear syrup which is again fed
into a vacuum pan for evaporation.
8.
Separation and packaging: Once the final evaporation and drying process is done,
screens separate the different- sized sugar crystals Large and small crystals are

Wasting paper is like chopping down trees Comment:
2_
Some papers are relatively cheap: The paper used for this
10 text book, for
example,
is expensive.
Are different types of paper manufactured by different
processes?
Wood is the raw material for
making wood pulp and paper: Wood pulp is a dry fibrous
material used for making paper: The timberresources used to make woodpulp are referred
to as
pulp wood. Woodpulp is made from soft-wood trees, such as spruce, pine, fir, larch
and hemlock, and from hard woods, such as eucalyptus, aspen and birch.
Wood is composed of cellulose, lignin, oils and resins. Lignin is used to bind fibres of
cellulose together: Toprovide wood pulp, the cellulose must be separated from the lignin.
Manufacturing Of pulp and paper involves the following steps:
1.
Harvesting trees involves the cutting down of trees from their growing areas and
transporting the timber to the paper and pulp industry:
2 .
Preparation for pulping is a step in which the bark ofthe tree is removed and then
the wood is chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips (pieces)
3.
Pulping isa step used to make wood pulp from the chipped wood pieces. This can
beaccomplished by either mechanical or chemical means depending on the strength
and
of paper to be manufactured:
a
Mechanical pulping: It utilizes steam, pressure andhigh temperatures instead
of chemicals to tear the fibres. The fibre quality is greatly reduced because
mechanical pulping creates short, weak fibres that still contain the lignin that bonds
the fibres together: Paper used for newspapers are a typical product of
mechanical pulping:
b Chemicalpulping: Chemical pulp is produced by combining wood chips and
chemicals in
vessels called digesters. Heat and the chemicals break down
the lignin which binds the cellulose fibres together without seriously degrading
the cellulose fibres. Chemicalpulp is manufactured
the Kraft process or
the Sulphite Process.
i)
TheKraft Process is the dominant chemical pulping method. It is the most
widely usedmethod for making pulp from all types oftrees The process uses

using
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
aqueous sodium hydroxideand sodium sulphide as a digestion solution.After
digestion for about fourhours ata temperature of 170*C, the pulp is separated
by filtration This process uses a basic digestion medium:
i) The Sulphite Process uses a
cooking liquor (digestion) solution ofsodium
bisulphate o magnesium bisulphate digester at pH of about 3 in a pulp.
The action ofthe hydrogen sulphide ions at 60'C over 6 to 12 hours dissolves
the lignin and separates it from the cellulose. After the process is complete,
the pulp is recovered by filtration:
The wood pulp achieved from the Sulphite or Kraft processes is washedto
remove chemicals and passed through a series ofscreens to remove foreign
materials.
4.
Bleaching: It is the process ofremoving colouring matter from wood pulp and
increasing its brightness The most common bleaching agents are strong oxidizing
agents such as chlorine, chlorine oxide, ozone and hydrogen peroxide.
5.
Making paper from pulp: After bleaching, the pulp is processed into liquid stock
that can be transferredto a paper mill: The
suspension is poured onto a continuously
moving screen belt and the liquor is allowed to seep away by gravity to produce
paper sheet: The continuous sheet then moves through additional rollers that compress
the fibres and remove the residual water to produce fine paper:

Tanning isaprocess ofconvertingraw animalhides and skin to leather; using tannin Leather
is a durable and flexible material created by the tanning ofanimal hides and skin. Tannin is
an acidic chemical thatpermanently alters the protein structure ofa skin so that it can never
return to rawhide or skin again.
Leather production involves various preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting
1.
Preparatory stages are those in which the hide or skin is prepared for tanning:
This stage includes curing, soaking, flesh removal, hairremoval, scudding, and
deliming;
2221
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
a
Curing: This process involves salting or drying thehide once ithas been removed
from the animal. Curing is employed to prevent putrefaction ofthe protein
substance, collagen, from bacterial infection. Curing also removes excess water
from thehide and skin. Brine curing is the simplest and fastest method:
b
Soaking: In this process, curedhides are soaked in water for several hours to
several days to remove salt, dirt; debris, blood and excess animal fat from the
skin:
Flesh removal: In this process, animal hides are moved through a machine
that strips the flesh from the surface ofthe hide.
Hair removal: In this
the soaked hides and skins are transported to
vats where
are immersed in a mixture oflime and water: This process is
called liming: It loosens the hair from the skin and makes hair-removal easier:
After 1-10
soaking, the hair is mechanically removed from the hide by a
hair-removing machine.
Scudding: This is the process in which hair and fat missed by the machines are
removed from the hide with a plastic tool or dullknife.
f
Deliming: This process involves the removal oflime from the skin or hide in a
vat of acid.After this preparatory process, the skin orhide is ready fortanning:
23
Tanning is a process that converts the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable
material: There are two main types of tanning:
a
Vegetable or natural tanning: The skin is placed in a solution oftannin Tannins
occur naturally in the barks and leaves ofmany plants The primary barks
in
modern times are chestnut, oak tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove,
wattle (acacia) and myrobalan. Naturally tanned hide is flexible and is used
formaking shoes, luggage and furniture.
b
Mineral tanning: In this process, the skin is placed in solutions of chemicals
such as chromium sulphate and other salts of chromium. Chrome tanning is faster
than natural (vegetable) tanningandrequires only twenty four hours. The leather
is greenish-blue in colour derived from the chromium: This process produces
stretchable leather that is used for making garments and handbags

Food preservation is the process oftreating and handling foodto stop or greatly reduce
spoilage, loss of quality, edibility or nutritive value caused or accelerated by micro-
organisms
Preservation usually involves preventing the growth ofbacteria, fungi and other micro-
organisms, as well as reducing the oxidation of fats, which causes rancidity

What modern methods of food preserving and processing do we use in Ethiopia?
Discuss in groups and give a presentation to the class.
Modern methods of food preservation are:
a
Freezing: This is one ofthe most commonly used processes, commercially and
domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods such as potatoes, as well as
prepared foodstuffs that wouldnot require freezing in their normal state:
b
Freeze-drying: Water vapourhas easier access through the cell structure of =
product compared to water-penetrating the productand evaporating from the surface
of the product as is the case of other drying methods The gentle escape of water
vapour in the freeze-drying process leaves the product close to its original
taste, and colour and there is no loss ofaroma or flavour:
For
example, liquids such as coffee, tea, juices and other extracts, vegetables,
segments of fish and meatproducts Freeze-drying is a superiorpreservation method
for a
variety of foodproducts and food ingredients
Vacuum-packing: Stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tightbag
or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria ofthe oxygen needed for survival,
slowing down the rate ofspoiling: Vacuum-packing is commonly used for
nuts to reduce loss of flavour from oxidation:

Pollution is any discharge ofa solid, liquid or gaseous substance or radiation (energy) into
an environment that causes unwanted changes Pollution causes short-term or long-term
harm that affects the earth's ecological balance and lowers the quality of life in the
environment. A
pollutant is any substance that changes air; water or any other natural
resource in a way that impairs the use ofthe resource.
Pollutants are discharged into the environment asa result ofnatural events (like a volcanic
eruption) and as a result ofhuman activities (such as the operation of chemical industries,
agriculture, etc ) Pollutants can be classifiedby thetype ofpollution-

2
Give your suggestions on the statement;'Air pollution any where is a potential threat
elsewhere.'
Airpollution is causedby the presence of contaminant gaseous substances in the air that
affect the lives ofplants and animals on earth. Some common air pollutants are sulphur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide,
ozone,
hydrocarbons, particulates,
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and lead compounds.
Sulphur dioxide (SO,): This enters the atmospheric air from the combustion of coal and
petroleum, and during extraction of metals from their sulphide ores. It causes coughing;
chest pains and shortness ofbreath: It is thought to be a cause for bronchitis and
diseases. Itslowly oxidizes to SO; by reacting with the oxygen in the air:
Oxides of nitrogen: These can be formed in the atmosphere by natural processes like
thunderstorms Combustion offossil fuel containing nitrogen compounds as impurities and
exhaust gases from furnaces and engines increase the amount ofnitric oxide, NO,and
nitrogen dioxide, NOz in the atmosphere. Nitric oxide, NO, catalyzes the decomposition
ofozone in the upper layer ofthe atmosphere to oxygen, thus decreasing the ozone layer:

and NOz react with rainwater and form sulphurous acid (H,SO,), sulphuric

and
nitric acid (HNO,) respectively and cause acidrain Acidrain accelerates
corrosion and the deterioration of metals, buildings, statues and also causes tree defoliation,
release ofheavy metal ions from soil into water courses and drop in the pH ofwater in
rivers and lakes.
Hydrocarbons and ozone are responsible forphotochemical smog: It is characterized by
a
reddish-brown haze containing substances irritating to the eye, nose, and
and
causes extensive damage to vegetation: Considerable amounts ofhydrocarbons are released
into the atmosphere by theevaporation of gasoline as unburnthydrocarbons inauto exhaust
These substances react with ozone to give compounds that contribute to the oxidizing
nature of photochemical smog:
Carbon monoxide: Most of the carbon monoxide escapes into the atmosphere due to
the incomplete combustion of fuel Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide impairs vision,
produces headaches, and exerts strain on the heart. Italso reduces the oxygen-carrying
capacity ofthebloodby reacting with haemoglobin.
Particulates: Dust storms, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and human activities such as
miningand burning coaland oil increase theamount ofsolidparticles in theair: Industrial
areas contain particles of limestone, fertilizers, coal, stones, cement and silica. These
particulates irritate the lungs and deleteriously affect breathing
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigerants, solvents
andplastic foam-blowingagents When entering the atmosphere,
penetrate into the
upper layers and interact with ultraviolet radiation as follows
UV

CL
CFCl:
~Cl
The free chlorine, CL,reacts with ozone to form chlorine monoxide and oxygen:
'Cl
CIO:
+
These reactions result in the conversion of ozone to molecular oxygen and contribute to
depletion of the ozone layer: This situation in the upper atmosphere allows dangerous
ultravioletradiationto reachtheearth's surface. This radiation causes skin cancerinhuman
Excess carbon dioxide: The combustion ofcoal and petroleum to generate electricity,
move our vehicles, heat our homes and supply power to our industrial machinery causes a
significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Combustion
of these fuels releases about 20 billion tonnes of COz annually: The increase in the
concentration of COz in the atmosphere has resulted in a rise in the average global
temperature, owing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide and water vapour absorb
infrared radiation, re-radiated from the earth, behaving like the glass in a green house.
Since COz and water vapour absorb heat-
are called green-house gases Due to the

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
absorption ofheatby the green house gases in the atmosphere, the overall effect is global
warming (an increase in the average temperature of our planet): This rise in global
temperature causes melting ofpolar ice and thus additional water flowing into the oceans.
This situation; in turn, results in the
rising ofthe levels ofseas and oceans, flooding of
coastlines and lowland areas, which can submerge these areas.
Heavy metals: Lead contamination in the atmosphere is a result of vehicle engines that
use fuels
containing tetraethyl lead which is added to the fuel to reduce engine knocking:
The use ofleadpaints also contributes towards lead contamination: High levels oflead
cause
damage to the brain, kidneys and liver:

CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
Water pollution is the degradation ofthe quality of water broughtabout by the discharge
into it ofuntreated sewage, industrial and agricultural waste, and oil spillage. In general,
water is said to be polluted ifit contains matter that affects the health ofliving things O
causes
damage to property The major water pollutants are nitrate and phosphate fertilisers
washed out ofthe soil, phosphate detergents, untreated sewage, insecticides and herbicides;
and the heavy metal ion, acidic and/or basic residues released by industrial processes.
Phosphate and nitrate fertilisers washed out ofthe soil andphosphate detergents from
untreated water; enter natural water systems, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and seas.
These dissolved minerals are valuable nutrients for plants, and their discharge into the
water systems accelerates the growth ofsurface-waterplants, such as algae. As a result,
less light reaches the bottom-living plants, which reduces the photosynthesis
needto
live, and they die. When these aquatic plants die,
rot under the action ofbacteria
which multiply greatly and consume the oxygen dissolved in the water ata rate faster than
natural aeration orphotosynthesis can replenish: Thus, the amount of oxygen in the water
decreases. This depletion ofoxygen kills aquatic animals like fish: This sequence of events
is called eutrophication
Insecticides (pesticides) and herbicides
in
agriculture may also be washed into
lakes, rivers, streams and seas. Some ofthe insecticides and herbicides do not decompose
easily andare persistent in the environment. Residues ofthese insecticides and herbicides
may enter the food chains andaccumulate in an
organism that is consumed by the next
organism: The increasing amount of insecticide and herbicide residue in the bodies of
animals causes health and behavioural problems
The release ofheavy metal ions, acidic and/or basic residues from industrialprocesses into
natural water systems, such as lakes and rivers, causes pH changes in the water: Water
organisms need specific ranges of water pH to survive, so these changes in pH can kill
them. In the same way, increasing concentrations oftoxic metal
kills some aquatic
organisms
The release ofuntreated sewage to natural water systems can spread water-borne diseases
such as cholera;
typhoid, hepatitis,and

Factors involved in land pollution include:
Spillages ofoil from leaking pipelines
Harmful heavy metal ions from buried waste leaching into water systems.
Leaching ofharmful chemicals from corroded metal drums which have been buried
underground.
Dumping of non-biodegradable (do not decompose by the action of bacteria)
wastes like plastics which remain unchanged in the soil for decades or hundreds of
years Their accumulation in the soil hinders air and water movement and affects the
growth ofplants.

Unit Summary
A chemical industry is any institution involved in the production of chemicals:
Achemical industry is characterized by using raw materials available in nature
and transforming them into desired products by chemical means.
Most of the materials used by the industries are present in nature.
Natural resources are classified aS renewable and non-renewable:
Aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth $ crust. It is manufactured
by the electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide mixed with cryolite
the
Hallprocess:
Aluminium is used to make light-weight alloys that can be used for aircraft
and similar constructions.
Aluminium resists corrosion due to the formation of a thin film of an oxide on
its surface.
Iron is the second-most abundant metal in the earth $ crust.
Iron is extracted in a blast furnace. The furnace is charged with iron ore, coke
and limestone, and hot air is blown up from the bottom.
Limestone is used in the blast furnace to remove impurities like sand (silica) in
the form of slag:
The type of iron obtained directly from the blast furnace is called pig iron and
it is impure.
Wrought iron is the purest form of iron obtained from pig-iron by removing
most of the impurities.

Steel is an alloy ofiron containing definite amounts of carbon and other metals
like chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium, manganese etc:
Steel is manufactured by the Bessemer Converter; Open-Hearth Furnace and
Basic
Oxygen Processes.
Copper is extracted by roasting chalcopyrites (CuFeS))
Copper that is obtained by roasting chalcopyrites is called blister copper: It is
impure, and it is refined further by electrolysis:
Copper is malleable and ductile, a
conductor of heat and electricity and
is used to make electric wires and in the manufacture of alloys.
Nitrogen constitutes about 80% by volume of atmospheric air:
Nitrogen is manufactured by the fractional distillation of liquefied air:
Nitrogen is relatively inert However; its reactivity increases when heated and
combined with metals of group IA and IIA to form nitrides and with oxygen to
form oxides like NO and NOz
Phosphorus is manufactured by heating a mixture of rock phosphate, coke
(carbon) and silica in an electric furnace.
Phosphorus has two common
allotropes, white and red phosphorus:
White
phosphorus is highly reactive, while red phosphorous is relatively stable.
White phosphorus is stored under water:
Phosphorus reacts with oxygen and chlorine.
Oxygen makes up about 20% by volume of air: It is manufactured by the
fractional distillation of liquid air:
Oxygen is the most abundant element in the earth $ crust.
Sulphur exists in the elemental state in underground deposits from which it is
extracted by the Frasch process:
Sulphur reacts with oxygen to form sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide:
Sulphur is used for the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the Contact Process:
Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine.
Chlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent and reacts with heated metals to form
chlorides
Chlorine and chlorine water are used to bleach coloured materials and as
disinfectant:
Glass is a mixture Of two or more silicates:

Ceramics are materials that are baked or fired at very high temperatures:
Cement is made by heating a ground mixture of sand and clay. It contains calcium
oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide, iron (III) oxide, and magnesium oxide.
Sugar is manufactured from sugarcane in a series of steps:
Paper and pulp are manufactured from trees in a series of steps Bleaching
agents such aS chlorine, chlorine oxide, ozone or hydrogen peroxide are used
in paper and pulp production.
Tanning is a process of converting skin to leather:
The methods used in food processing and preservation are salting, pickling,
sugaring, smoking, drying, canning etc.
Pollution is the
discharge of harmful waste material into the environment.
The three types of pollution are air; land and water pollution.
Air
pollution is caused by the release of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, particulates, CFCs, and lead compounds
etc. into the
atmosphere.
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated sewage, industrial and
agricultural waste and oil spillage.
Land pollution results from the spillage of oil, leaching of harmful chemicals

Molecular Shape and Polarity
The three-dimensional shape of a molecule is particularly important when
the molecule contains
covalent bonds.
As you may recall from your
previous chemistry course, a
covalent bond is a covalent bond
between two atoms with different electronegativities.
Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts
electrons in a chemical bond. The electrons in a
covalent bond are
attracted more strongly to the atom with the higher electronegativity This
atom has a
partial negative charge, while the other atom has a partial
tive charge. Thus, every
bond has a bond dipole: a partial negative
charge and a partial positive charge, separated by the length of the bond.
Figure 1.4 illustrates the polarity of a double carbon-oxygen bond. Oxygen
has a
higher electronegativity than carbon. Therefore, the oxygen atom in
a
carbon-oxygen bond has a partial negative charge, and the carbon atom
has a
partial positive charge.

Predicting Molecular Polarity
A molecule is considered to be polar, or to have a molecular polarity,
when the molecule has an overall imbalance of charge. That

molecule has a region with a
partial positive charge, and a region with a
partial negative charge. Surprisingly, not all molecules with

water molecule has two

H bonds, and it is a

How do you predict whether O not a molecule that contains
bonds
has an overall molecular polarity? To determine molecular polarity, you
must consider the
of the molecule and the bond dipoles within the
molecule_
If equal bond dipoles act in opposite directions in three-dimensional
space, they counteract each other:

General Rules for Naming Organic Compounds
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has set
standard rules for naming organic compounds. The systematic (or IUPAC)
names of alkanes and most other organic compounds follow the same
pattern, shown below.
prefix

suffix
The Root: How Long Is the Main Chain?
The root of a
compound'$ name indicates the number of carbon atoms in
the main (parent) chain or
Table 1.2 gives the roots for hydrocarbon
chains that are up to ten carbons
To determine which root to use,
count the carbons in the main chain, Or main

The Suffix: What Family Does the Compound Belong To?
The suffix indicates the type of compound, according to the functional
groups present: (See Table 1.4 on page 22.) As you progress through this
chapter; you will learn the suffixes for different chemical families. In your
previous chemistry course, you learned the suffixes -ane for alkanes, -ene
for alkenes, and ~yne for alkynes. Thus, an alkane composed of six carbon
atoms in a chain is called hexane.
An alkene with three carbons is called
propene.

The Prefix: What Is Attached to the Main Chain?
The prefix indicates the name and location of each branch and functional
group
the main carbon chain
Most
organic compounds have branches,
called alkyl groups, attached to the main chain: An alkyl group is obtained
by removing one hydrogen atom from an alkane. To name an alkyl group,
change the -ane suffix to -yl. For
example,
CH3 is the alkyl group that is
derived from methane, CH4 _
It is called the methyl group, taken from the
root meth-. Table 1.3 gives the names of the most common alkyl groups

Read the steps below to review how to name hydrocarbons. Then examine
the two Sample Problems that follow.
How to Name Hydrocarbons
Step 1
Find the root: Identify the longest chain
Or
in the hydrocarbon:
If the hydrocarbon is an alkene Or an
make sure that you
include any multiple bonds in the main chain. Remember that the
chain does not have to be in a straight line. Count the number of
carbon atoms in the main chain to obtain the root; If it is a
compound, add the prefix
before the root_
2 Find the suffix: If the hydrocarbon is an alkane, use the suffix -ane.
Use ~ene if the hydrocarbon is an alkene. Use ~yne if the hydrocarbon
is an
alkyne. If more than one double o triple bond is present; use
the prefix di- (2) or tri- (3) before the suffix to indicate the number
of multiple bonds.
3 Give a
position number to every carbon atom in the main chain.
Start from the end that gives you the lowest possible position
number for the double or triple bond, if there is one. If there is no
double or triple bond, number the compound s0 that the branches
have the lowest possible position numbers.
4
Find the prefix: Name each branch as an alkyl group, and give it
a
position number: If more than one branch is present, write the
names of the branches in alphabetical order Put the position
number of any double or triple bonds after the position numbers
and names of the branches, just before the root: This is the
Note: Use the carbon atom with the lowest
position number to give
the location of a double o triple bond:

possible structure for benzene. For many years, scientists could not
determine the structure of benzene. From its molecular formula, CsH6_
scientists reasoned that it should contain two double bonds and one triple
bond, Or even two
triple bonds. Benzene, however; does not undergo the
same reactions as other
compounds with double or triple bonds.
We know today that benzene is a
compound with the equivalent
of three double bonds and three single bonds,
as
shown in Figure 1.9(A).
However; the electrons that form the double bonds in benzene are spread
out and shared over the whole molecule. Thus, benzene actually has six
identical bonds, each one half-way between a single and a double bond:

Physical Properties and Forces Between Molecules
Organic compounds that have the same functional group often have
similar physical properties, such as boiling points, melting points, and
solubilities. Physical properties are largely determined by intermolecular
forces, the forces of attraction and repulsion between particles. Three
types of intermolecular forces are introduced below. You will examine
these forces further in Chapter 4_
Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular attraction between the
hydrogen atom from
N--H, 0--H, or F-~H group on
one
molecule,
and a
nitrogen, oxygen, Or fluorine atom on another molecule
The attractive forces between
molecules are called dipole-dipole
interactions. These forces cause
molecules to
to each other:
Dispersion forces are attractive forces that occur between all covalent
molecules. These forces are usually very weak for small molecules, but
strengthen as the size of the molecule increases.
The process that is outlined on the next page will help you to predict the
physical properties of organic compounds by examining the intermolecular
forces between molecules. As you progress through the chapter; referring
back to this process will enable you to understand the reasons behind
trends in physical properties.

Molecules that can form

than similar molecules that cannot form

Table 1.6 lists some common physical properties of alcohols.
As
you learned earlier in this chapter, alcohols are
molecules that
experience hydrogen bonding: The physical properties of alcohols
depend on these characteristics.
Table 1.6 Physical Properties of Alcohols
Polarity of functional group
The 0--Hbond is very polar: As the number of carbon
atoms in an alcohol becomes
the alkyl group's
non-polar nature becomes more important than the
0--H bond, Therefore small alcohols are more
than alcohols with
hydrocarbon portions.
Hydrogen bonding
Alcohols experience hydrogen bonding with other
alcohol molecules and with water:
Solubility in water
The capacity of alcohols for hydrogen bonding makes
them extremely soluble in water Methanol and ethanol
are miscible (infinitely soluble) with water: The
solubility of an alcohol decreases as the number of
carbon atoms increases_
Melting and boiling points
Due to the strength of the hydrogen bonding, most
alcohols have higher melting and boiling
than
alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. Most
alcohols are liquids at room temperature.
Additional Characteristics of Alcohols
Alcohols are extremely flammable, and should be treated with caution.
Most alcohols are
poisonous. Methanol can cause blindness Or death
when consumed. Ethanol is consumed widely in moderate quantities,
but it causes impairment and/or death when consumed in excess_

Alkyl Halides
An alkyl halide (also known as a haloalkane) is an alkane in which one
or more
hydrogen atoms have been replaced with halogen atoms, such
as F; Cl, Br; or I The functional group of alkyl halides is R-~X, where X
represents a
halogen atom
Alkyl halides are similar in structure, polarity,
and reactivity to alcohols.
To name
an
alkyl halide, first name the parent
hydrocarbon: Then use the prefix fluoro-,
chloro-, bromo-
or iodo-, with a
position number; to indicate the presence of a fluorine atom, chlorine
atom, bromine atom, Or iodine atom.
The
following Sample Problem
shows how to name an alkyl halide.
Sample Problem

Problem
Name the following compound
Br

CH:
Solution
The parent hydrocarbon of this compound is cyclohexane: There are two
bromine atoms attached at position numbers 1 and 3. Therefore, part
of the prefix is 1,3-dibromo-.
There is also a methyl group at
position
number 4_
Because the groups are
in alphabetical order; the full
prefix is 1,3-dibromo-4-methyl-. (The
is numbered s0 that the
two
bromine atoms have the lowest possible position numbers. See
the Problem Tip on page 18.) The full name of the compound is
1,3-dibromo-4-methylcyclohexane.

Table 1.7 Physical Properties of Ethers
Polarity of functional group
The bent
around the oxygen atom in an ether
means that the two €_0 dipoles do not counteract each
other: Because a C_~O bond is less
than an O--H
bond, an ether is less
than an alcohol.
Hydrogen bonding
Because there is no 0--H bond in an ether; hydrogen
bonding does not occur between ether molecules. Ethers
can accept hydrogen bonding from water molecules.
Solubility in water
Ethers are usually soluble in water: The solubility of an
ether decreases as the size of the alkyl groups increases _

The

(See Figure 1.20.) Aldehydes and ketones are often used to make
perfumes. The rose ketones (shown in Figure 1.21) provide up to 90%
of the characteristic rose odour Perfumers mix organic compounds,
such as the rose ketones, to obtain distinctive and attractive scents.
Since aldehydes and ketones are polar;,
can act as
solvents.
Because of the non-polar hydrocarbon part of their molecules, aldehydes
and ketones can also act as solvents for
non-polar compounds. For
example, 2-propanone (common name: acetone) is an important organic
solvent in the chemical industry:

Solubility in water
Carboxylic acids with low molecular masses are very
soluble in water_
The first four simple carboxylic acids
(methanoic acid, ethanoic acid, propanoic acid, and
butanoic acid) are miscible with water:
Like alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes, the solubility
of  carboxylic acids in water decreases as the number of
carbon atoms increases.
Melting and boiling points
Because of the strong hydrogen bonds between
molecules, the melting and boiling points of carboxylic
acids are very high:

Additional Characteristics of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids often have unpleasant odours. For example, butanoic
acid has the odour of stale sweat.
The
OH group in a carboxylic acid does not behave like the basic
hydroxide ion, OH . Oxygen has a high electronegativity (attraction
to electrons) and there are two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid
functional group. These electronegative oxygen atoms help to carry the
extra negative charge that is caused when & positive hydrogen atom
dissociates.
This is why the hydrogen atom in & carboxylic acid is able
to dissociate, and the carboxylic acid behaves like an acid:

Figure 1.25 compares the melting and boiling points of a carboxylic
acid with the melting and boiling

As you can see, the

of the carboxylic acid
are much
higher than the melting and boiling
of the other
compounds This is due to the exceptionally strong hydrogen bonding
between carboxylic acid molecules.

group of a carboxylic acid with a different group, it is called a derivative
of a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have several important derivatives.
In this section, you will study two of these derivatives: esters and amides.

When heated, butanoic acid reacts with ethanol to produce an ester called
ethyl butanoate:
To name an ester; you must
recognize that an ester can be thought of as
having two distinct parts. The main part of the ester contains the
COO
group. This part comes from the parent acid.
When numbering the main
chain of a carboxylic acid, the carbon atom in the carboxyl group is always
given position number 1_
The second part of an ester is the alkyl group.
To name an ester; follow the steps below.
How to Name an Ester
1
Identify the main part of the ester; which contains the C==0 group.
This part comes from the parent acid. Begin by naming the parent
acid.
Step 2 Replace the -oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with
-oate.
Step 3
The second part of an ester is the alkyl group that is attached to the
oxygen atom. Name this as you would name any other alkyl group.
Put the two names
together: Note that esters are named as two
words. (See Figure 1.27.)

each other:

Table 1.13 Physical Properties of Esters
Polarity of functional group
Like carboxylic acids, esters are usually
molecules.
Hydrogen bonding
Esters do not have an 0-H bond. Therefore, they cannot
form hydrogen bonds with other ester molecules.
Solubility in water
Esters can accept hydrogen bonds from water: Therefore,
esters with very low molecular masses are soluble in
water: Esters with carbon chains that are longer than
three or four carbons are not soluble in water_
Melting and boiling points

Additional Characteristics 0f Esters
Esters often have pleasant odours and tastes, s0
are used to
produce perfumes and artificial flavours. In fact, the characteristic tastes
and smells of many fruits come from esters. (See Figure 1.28.)
Amides
An ester can be thought of as the combination of a carboxylic acid and
an alcohol. Similarly;
can think of an amide as the combination of
a
carboxylic acid and ammonia O an amine.
An amide is an organic
compound that has a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and
single-bonded to a nitrogen atom.
Amides have the functional group below:
~N
The general formula for an amide is R-_CO--NRz. R can stand for a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group. Figure 1.29 gives some

How to Name an Amide
1
Locate the part of the amide that contains the C==0 group. Name
the parent carboxylic acid that this part derives from. Note: The
carbon in the €=0 group is always given position number 1_
Step 2 Replace the -oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with the
suffix -amide
Step 3
Decide whether the compound is a primary, secondary, O tertiary
amide:
If there are two
hydrogen atoms (and no alkyl groups) attached
to the nitrogen atom, the compound is a primary amide and
needs no other
prefixes.
If there is one alkyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, the
compound is a secondary amide. Name the alkyl group, and
give it location letter N- to indicate that it is bonded to the
nitrogen atom.
If there are two alkyl groups, the compound is a tertiary amide.
Place the alkyl groups in alphabetical order: Use location letter
N- before each group to indicate that it is bonded to the nitrogen
atom. If the two groups are identical, use N,N-.

Addition, Substitution, and Elimination Reactions
Addition reactions, substitution reactions, and elimination reactions are

classified as one of these three types.
Addition Reactions
In an addition reaction, atoms are added to a double or triple bond: One
bond of the multiple bond breaks so that two new bonds can form-

Oxidation and Reduction
An important type of organic reaction occurs when there is a change in
the number of hydrogen Or oxygen atoms that are bonded to carbon. In
Unit 5, you will take a close look at oxidation-reduction reactions in terms
of the transfer of electrons. As you will learn, oxidation and reduction
always occur together: One reactant is oxidized while the other reactant
is reduced. In this unit, however; you will focus on the organic reactant
only. Therefore, you will deal with oxidation and reduction separately, as
apply to organic compounds. In organic chemistry, oxidation and
reduction are defined by the changes of the bonds to carbon atoms in the
organic reactant:
Chapter 2
Reactions of Organic Compounds
MHR
59

they
Oxidation
In organic chemistry, oxidation is defined as a reaction in which a carbon
atom forms more bonds to oxygen, 0, or less bonds to hydrogen, H; An
oxidation that involves the formation of double C==0 bonds may also be
classified as an elimination reaction.
For example, alcohols can be oxidized to produce aldehydes and
ketones. Oxidation occurs when an organic compound reacts with
an
oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents include acidified potassium
permanganate, KMnO4, acidified potassium dichromate, KzCrzOz , and
ozone, 03
The symbol [O] is used to symbolize an oxidizing agent, as
shown below. Note that equations for the oxidation of organic compounds
are often left unbalanced. The purpose of the equation is to show the
changes in the organic reactant only:
OH

To identify an oxidation, count and compare the number of C_H

product: Try it for the
following example.

Reduction
In organic chemistry, reduction is defined as
a reaction in which a
carbon atom forms fewer bonds to oxygen, 0, Or more bonds to hydrogen,
H: Often, a €C=0 bond o C-C bond is reduced to a single bond by
reduction. A reduction that transforms double C==C or C=0 bonds to
single bonds may also be classified as an addition reaction. Aldehydes,
ketones, and carboxylic acids can be reduced to become alcohols.
Alkenes
and alkynes can be reduced by the addition of Hz to become alkanes.
Reduction occurs when an
organic compound reacts with a reducing
agent. Common reducing agents are lithium aluminum hydride, LiAIH4
and
hydrogen gas over a platinum catalyst, Hz/Pt.
The
symbol [H] is used
to
symbolize
a

showing the reduction of organic compounds are often left unbalanced

Solution
(a)
A double bond is formed. One reactant becomes two products.
The organic product has fewer atoms bonded to carbon. Thus,
this reaction is an elimination reaction.
(b)
A
double bond becomes a single bond. Two reactants become one
product: The organic product has more atoms bonded to carbon:
Thus, this reaction is an addition reaction.
(c) No double bond is broken or formed. Two reactants form two
products.
An atom in the organic reactant (Br) is replaced by a
different group of atoms (OH). Thus, this is a substitution reaction.

The product has gained a €_~H bond and lost a €_0 bond. Thus,
this is
a

(b) Count the number of C-H bonds and C~0 bonds in the reactant
and in the product: Although the C__H bonds are not shown, you
know that a carbon atom forms a total of four bonds.
Reactant: 11 C__H bonds, 1 C 0 bond
Product: 10 €__H bonds, 2 C__0 bonds (or 1 C ==0 bond)
The product has lost a €__H bond and gained a C_0 bond:

In this section, you will learn how to predict the reactions of different
functional groups. You studied the most common reaction of alkanes,
combustion, in your previous chemistry course_
For this reason, the
reactions of alkanes will not be considered here.
The reactions of amines
and ethers will be left for a later chemistry course.
Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
Because alkenes and alkynes have reactive double o triple bonds,
undergo addition reactions. Some common atoms and groups of atoms
that can be added to a double or triple bond include
Hand OH (from HzO)
Hand X (from HX), where X = Cl, Br; or I
X and X (from X2), where X = Cl, Br; Or I
H and H (from Hz)
Depending on which atoms are added to the multiple bond, the product
may be an alcohol, alkyl halide, alkane, or alkene (if atoms are added to a
triple bond).

Addition to Alkenes
The
product of an addition reaction depends on the symmetry of the
reactants.
A
symmetrical alkene has identical groups on either side of the
double bond. Ethene, CHz
CHz, is an example of a symmetrical alkene.
An alkene that has different groups on either side of the double bond is
called an
asymmetrical alkene. Propene, CH;CH -= CHz , is an example of
an
asymmetrical alkene.
The molecules that are added to a multiple bond can also be classified
as
symmetrical Or asymmetrical. For example, chlorine, Clz, breaks into
two identical parts when it adds to a multiple bond: Therefore, it is a
symmetrical reactant: Water; HOH, breaks into two different groups (H and
OH) when it adds to a multiple bond, s0 it is an asymmetrical reactant
In Figures 2.3 and 2.4, at least one of the reactants is
symmetrical:
When one

product is possible.

Reactions of Alcohols
Alcohols can react in several ways, depending on the reactants and on the
conditions of the reaction.
For
example, alcohols can undergo substitution
with halogen acids, elimination to form alkenes, and oxidation to form
aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids.
Substitution Reactions of Alcohols
When a
halogen acid, such as HCl, HBr; or HI, reacts with an alcohol,
the
halogen atom is substituted for the OH group of the alcohol. This is
shown in Figure 2.7(A). The reverse reaction takes place when an alkyl
halide reacts with OH- in a basic solution_
See Figure 2.7(B).

Elimination Reactions of Alcohols
When an alcohol is heated in the presence of the strong acid and
dehydrating agent, HzSO4, an elimination reaction takes place. This type
of reaction is shown in Figure 2.8, on the next page. The OH group and
one H atom leave the molecule, and water is produced. As a result, the
molecule forms a double bond. Because water is
produced, this type of
reaction is also called a dehydration (meaning "loss of water") reaction

Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones
As you observed in the investigation, different alcohols react differently
with an
oxidizing agent: In the same way, aldehydes and ketones react
differently with oxidizing and reducing agents, even though aldehydes
and ketones have similar structures.
Oxidation of Aldehydes
In the presence of an oxidizing agent, an aldehyde is oxidized to produce
a
carboxylic acid. The hydrogen atom that is bonded to the carbon atom
of the C=0 bond is

The reaction of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol to form an ester is
called an esterification reaction. An esterification reaction is one type of
condensation reaction. In a similar type of condensation reaction, an
amide can be formed from a carboxylic acid and an amine, but this
process is slightly longer and will not be discussed here.
Carboxylic acids can be reduced to form aldehydes and alcohols.
Reactions of Esters and Amides
Both esters and amides undergo hydrolysis reactions. In a hydrolysis
reaction, the ester Or amide bond is cleaved, Or split in two, to form two
products. As mentioned earlier; the hydrolysis of an ester produces a
carboxylic acid and an alcohol. The hydrolysis of an amide produces a
carboxylic acid and an amine. There are two methods of hydrolysis: acidic
hydrolysis and basic hydrolysis. Both methods are shown in Figure 2.9.
Hydrolysis usually requires heat. In acidic hydrolysis, the ester or amide
reacts with water in the presence of an acid, such as H2SO4. In basic
hydrolysis, the ester or amide reacts with the OH- ion, from NaOH O

Risks of the Polymer Industry
In the 1970s, workers at an American plastics manufacturing plant
began to experience serious illnesses. Several workers died of liver
cancer before the
problem
was traced to its source: prolonged exposure
to vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride (or chloroethene, CzHzCl) is used to
make polyvinylchloride (PVC). Unfortunately, vinyl chloride is a
powerful carcinogen. Government regulations have now restricted
workers' exposure to vinyl chloride.
Trace amounts of this dangerous
chemical are still present, however; as pollution in the environment.
The manufacture and disposal of PVC creates another serious
problem: Dioxin, shown in Figure 2.14, is a highly toxic chemical. It is
produced during the manufacture and burning of PVC plastics.
Cl
Cl
Figure 2.14
Dioxin has been shown to be extremely carcinogenic to some animals. As
well, it is suspected of disrupting hormone activity in the body, leading to reduced fertility
and birth defects.
Many synthetic polymers, including most plastics, do not degrade in the
environment; What can be done with plastic and other
ymer waste?
One solution may be the development and use of degradable plastics.
These are polymers that break down over time when exposed to
environmental conditions, such as light and bacteria.
The
Chemistry
Bulletin on the next page gives more information about degradable plastics.
Natural Polymers
Much of our
technology has been developed by observing and imitating
the natural world. Synthetic polymers, such as those you just encoun-
tered, were developed by imitating natural polymers. For example, the
natural polymer cellulose provides most of the structure of

initiatives are helping to reduce plastic waste
Another solution to this problem may involve the
technology of degradable plastics.
AII plastics are polymers, long molecules
made of repeating units. Because polymers
are extremely stable, they resist reaction.
Most
conventional plastics require hundreds or even
thousands of years to break down:
Degradable plastics are an important step
forward in technology: These new plastics can
break down in a relatively short time-_within six
months to

degradable plastics: biodegradable plastics and

Amino Acids and Proteins
protein is a natural polymer that is composed of monomers called
amino acids. Proteins are found in meat; milk, eggs, and legumes.
Wool, leather; and silk are natural materials that are made of proteins.
Your fingernails, hair; and skin are composed of different proteins.
Proteins carry out many important functions in your body, such as
speeding up chemical reactions (enzymes), transporting oxygen in your
blood (hemoglobin), and regulating your body responses (hormones).
There are 20 common amino acids in the human body All amino
acids contain a carboxylic acid group and an amino group. Amino acids
can be linked by amide bonds to form proteins. Each amino acid has a
different side chain, which is attached to the centre carbon atom: Figure
2.16, below, shows the structure of an amino acid. The letter G represents
the side chain of the amino acid. Examples of side chains include
CH:
(for the amino acid alanine),
CHzCONHz (for glutamine), and
CHzOH (for serine).

Lipids carry out many important functions in the body. Their most
important function is the long-term storage of energy. One
of fat con-
tains two-and-a-quarter times more energy than & gram of carbohydrate o
protein. When an animal consumes more carbohydrates than are needed
at the time, the body converts the excess carbohydrates to fat: Later; when
insufficient carbohydrates are available for energy, the body may break
down some of these fats to use for energy. Carbohydrates are still needed
in your diet; however; for the proper functioning of your cells.

organic compounds.
Risk-Benefit Analysis
How can you make the most informed decision possible when analyzing
the risks or benefits of a
product
Or issue? The
following steps are one
way to carry out a risk-benefit analysis for the manufacture and
use of an
organic compound
Step 1 Identify possible risks and benefits of the organic product: Ask
questions such as these:
What are the direct uses of this
product? (For example, is it used
as &
pharmaceutical
for a
specific disease or condition? Is it
an insecticide for a
specific insect
'pest"?)
What are the indirect uses of this product? (For
example, is it used
in the manufacture of a different organic Or inorganic product?)
What are the direct risks of making O using this product?
(For
example, is the product an environmental pollutant, or does
it contain
compounds that may be harmful to the environment?
Can the workers who manufacture this product be harmed by
exposure to it?)

example,
are harmful by-products produced in the manufacture
of this product? How much energy does the manufacture of this
product require, and where does the energy come from? What, if
any, side effects does this product cause?)

Research the answers to your questions from step 1. Ensure that
your information comes from reliable sources If there is controversy
on the isks and benefits of the product; find information that covers
both sides of the issue.
Step 3 Decide on your own
of view. In your opinion, are the benefits
greater than the risks? Do the risks outweigh the benefits?
Step 4
Consider possible alternatives that may lessen the risks. Ask
questions such as the following:
Does & similar; less harmful,
product exist?
Is there a better way to manufacture Or
dispose of this product?
What safety precautions can be taken to reduce the risks?

The First Step Toward the Modern Atomic Model
Chemists needed Dalton's atomic theory to advance their understanding
of matter and its behaviour
during chemical reactions. His atomic model,
however;, was inadequate for explaining the behaviour of substances.
For example, Dalton designed a system of symbols to show how atoms
combine to form other substances. Figure 3.2 on the next page shows
several of these symbols. As you will no doubt notice, Dalton correctly
predicted the formulas for carbon dioxide and sulfur trioxide, but ran into
serious trouble with water; ammonia, and methane. Dalton's attempt at
molecular modelling highlights a crucial limitation with his atomic
model. Chemists could not use it to

The Discovery of the Electron Requires a New Atomic Model
In 1897
Dalton's idea of an indivisible atom
was shattered with a
startling
announcement. A British scientist, Joseph John Thomson, had discovered
the existence of a negatively charged particle with mass less than
1000
that of a hydrogen atom. This particle was, of course, the electron.
1
(Later calculations showed that the mass of an electron is
that
1837
of a hydrogen atom.) It took several years for chemists to consider the
consequences of this discovery:
realized that if atoms contain
electrons, atoms must also contain a positive charge of some kind to
balance the negative charge. The atomic model that Thomson eventually
proposed is shown in Figure 3.3. Keep in mind that scientists had not
discovered the proton. Therefore, in this model, the entire sphere

In 1909, two of Rutherford's students reported observations that cast
doubts on Thomson's atomic model. As part of ongoing investigations into
the nature and properties of radioactive emissions,
aimed alpha (0)
particles at extremely thin metal foils.
A small number of the alpha
cles, about one in every 8000, were deflected significantly by the atoms
that made up the metal foils. These observations were inconsistent with
Thomson's atomic model. The researchers expected the alpha particles
to pass through the metal atoms with, at most, deflections averaging 200
of a
degree. Therefore, deflections of 90=
and more strained the credibility
of Thomson's model: Rutherford encouraged further investigation: Either
the observations and data were flawed, or Thomson's atomic model was_

model. In 1911, Rutherford published the results of the now-famous
gold-foil experiment, shown in Figure 3.4. On the basis of this experi-
ment, Rutherford suggested that the deflections he and his students
observed were caused by an encounter between an alpha particle and
an intense electric field at the centre of the atom.

The hypothesis, experiment; and results of Rutherfords gold foil experiment.
The experimental hypothesis and design owed much to the contributions of Rutherford's
students, Hans Geiger (of Geiger-counter fame) and Ernest Marsden.
Rutherford performed several calculations that led him to an inescapable
conclusion: the atom is made up mainly of empty space, with a small,
massive
of concentrated charge at the centre. Soon afterward, the
charge on this central region was determined to be positive, and was
named the atomic nucleus. Because Rutherford's atomic model, shown
in Figure 3.5 on the next page, pictures electrons in motion around an
atomic nucleus, chemists often call this the nuclear model of the atom.
You may also see it referred to as a planetary model because the electrons

Contrary to common belief,
Rutherford's 1911 paper on the
discovery of the nucleus does
not associate the nucleus with
a
positive charge. In fact;
Rutherford acknowledged that
the results of his experiment
were independent of the sign
of the charge. He suggested
that the charge of the nucleus,
as well as other questions
raised by his paper; were sub-
jects for later investigation:
Sometime between 1911 and
1913, someone identified the
charge on the nucleus as
positive. Whether or not this
person was Rutherford is

The atomic model in 1911. A Japanese scientist; Hantaro Nagaoka, proposed a

similar; disk-shaped model with electrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus, in 1904.
Rutherford notes in his 1911 paper that his results would be the same if Nagaoka's model
were correct.
Prelude to a New Atomic Model
Rutherford's atomic model solved problems inherent in Thomson'$
atomic model, but it also raised others. For example, an atomic nucleus
composed entirely of positive charges should fly apart due to electrostatic
forces of

Look again at the line spectrum for hydrogen shown in Figure 3.7 .
The energy that is associated with the coloured lines in this spectrum
corresponds to the change in energy of an electron as it moves to higher
Or lower energy levels. For example,
when a
hydrogen atom is exposed
to electrical current, or to another form of electromagnetic energy, its
electron absorbs photons of energy The atom is now said to be in an
excited state.
Another common way for atoms to become excited is
through atomic collisions. For
example, when two hydrogen atoms
collide, some of the kinetic energy from one atom is transferred to the
other atom. The electron of the second hydrogen atom absorbs this energy
and is excited to a higher energy level:
When the electron of a hydrogen atom that has been excited to the
third energy level falls to the second energy level, it emits light of certain
energy. Specifically, an electron that makes a transition from the third
energy level to the second energy level emits a photon of red light with
a
wavelength of 656 nm. Because line spectra result when atoms in an
excited state emit

spectra are also called emission spectra:

n =

Section Summary
You have seen how scientists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century developed and modified the atomic model. Changes in this model
resulted from both experimental evidence and new ideas about the nature
of matter and energy By 1913, chemists and physicists had a working
model that pointed tantalizingly in a promising direction. During the
third decade of the twentieth century, the promise was fulfilled. In the
next section, you will learn how physicists extended the ideas of Planck,
Einstein, and Bohr to develop an entirely new branch of physics, and a
new model of the atom.

It was fairly
straightforward to modify Bohr's model to include the idea
of energy sublevels for the hydrogen spectrum and for atoms O ions with
only one electron_
There was a
more fundamental problem, however: The
model still could not explain the spectra produced by many-electron
atoms. Therefore, a simple modification of Bohr's atomic model
was not
enough: The many-electron problem called for a new model to
spectra of all types of atoms. However; this was not possible until another
important property of matter
was
discovered:
The Discovery of Matter Waves
By the early 1920s, it was standard knowledge that energy had matter-like
properties. In 1924, a young physics student named Louis de Broglie
stated a hypothesis that followed from this idea. What if, de Broglie
wondered, matter has wave-like properties?
He developed an equation that enabled him to calculate the wave-
length associated with any object
small, Or microscopic. For
example,
a baseball with a mass of 142 g and
moving with a
of
25.0 m/s has a wavelength of 2 X
m
Objects that you can
see and
interact with, such as a baseball, have wavelengths s0 small that
do not have any significant observable effect on the object's motion.
However; for microscopic objects, such as electrons, the effect of wave-
length on motion becomes very
significant. For example, an electron
moving at a speed of 5.9 X 106 m/s has a wavelength of 1 x
m
The
size of this wavelength is greater than the size of the hydrogen atom to
which it belongs. (The calculated atomic radius of hydrogen is
5.3 X
m.)

De Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves received experimental
support in 1927. Researchers observed that streams of moving electrons
produced diffraction patterns similar to those that are produced by waves
of electromagnetic radiation. Since diffraction involves the transmission
of waves through a material, the observation seemed to support the idea
that electrons had wave-like properties.
The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom
In 1926, an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger; used mathematics and
statistics to combine de Broglie's idea of matter waves and Einstein's idea
of quantized energy particles (photons). Schrodinger's mathematical
equations and their interpretations, together with another idea called
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (discussed below), resulted in the birth
of the field of quantum mechanics. This is a branch of physics that uses
mathematical equations to describe the wave properties of sub-microscopic
particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. Schrodinger used
concepts from quantum mechanics to propose a new atomic model: the
quantum mechanical model of the atom
This model describes atoms as
having certain allowed quantities of energy because of the wave-like
properties of their electrons.

property given by its mass multiplied by its velocity) According to this
principle, if you can know an electron's
precise position and
around
the nucleus, as you would by defining its orbit, you cannot know with
certainty its velocity Similarly, if you know its precise velocity, you
cannot know with certainty its position. Based on the uncertainty
principle, Bohr's atomic model is flawed because you cannot assign
fixed
(orbits) to the motion of electrons.
Clearly, however; electrons exist: And
must exist somewhere.
To
describe where that
somewhere
is, scientists used an idea from a branch
of mathematics called statistics. Although you cannot talk about electrons
in terms of certainties, you can talk about them in terms of
probabilities.
Schrodinger used a type of equation called a wave equation to define the
probability of finding
atom's electrons at a

hydrogen, and is called the ground state.
The quantum number; n, for a

of names for the second quantum number: For example, you may see it
referred to as the

Regardless of its name, the second quantum number refers to the
energy sublevels within each principal energy level The name that this
book uses for the second quantum number is orbital-shape quantum

1 may be either 0 or 1. If n = 3, 1may be either 0, 1, or 2_
Notice that the
number of possible values for I in & given energy level is the same as the
value of n. In other words, if n = 2, then there are only two possible sub-
levels (two types of orbital shapes) at this energy level.
Each value for 1 is given a letter: $, p, d, or f
The 1 = 0 orbital has the letter s
The 1 = 1 orbital has the letter p.
The 1 = 2 orbital has the letter d.
The 1 = 3 orbital has the letter f.
To identify an energy sublevel (type of orbital), you combine the value
of n with the letter of the orbital
For
example, the sublevel with
n = 3 and 1 = 0 is called the 3s sublevel. The sublevel with n = 2 and 1 = 1

Solution
(a) The allowed values for ] are integers ranging from 0 to (n
1). The
allowed values for mp are integers ranging from -l to +l including 0.
Since each orbital has a single mp value, the total number of values
for mi gives the number of orbitals.
To find / from n:
If n = 3, 1 may be either 0, 1, or 2_
To find mp from 1:
If l =0, mp = 0
If ]= 1, m] may be -1, 0, +1
If ] = 2
m] may be -2
-1, 0, +1, +2
Since there are a total of 9
possible values for mz there are 9 orbitals
when n = 3.
(b) You determine the type of orbital by combining the value for n with
the letter used to identify 1. You can find possible values for mp from
1, and the total of the mp values gives the number of orbitals.
To name the type of orbital:
1 = 1, which describes a p orbital
Since n = 5, the
quantum numbers represent a Sp orbital:
To find mp from 1:
If ]=1,

Therefore, there are 3 possible Sp orbitals.

(a) Since the total number of orbitals for any given n is n?

the number of orbitals must be 9 (that is, 32).
(b) The number m values is

Since low energy usually means stability, it is reasonable that the
most stable energy state (ground state) for any atom is one in which its
electrons are in the lowest possible energy level. As
know, this is the

experimental evidence shows that only two atoms
have all their electrons in the 1s orbital: hydrogen and helium:

this is the case, you must consider another property of the

The Fourth Quantum Number: A Property of the Electron
As you learned from the previous section, three quantum numbers-_n, 1,
and mp
describe the energy, size,
and spatial orientation of an
orbital: A fourth quantum number describes a property of the electron that
results from its
particle-like nature. Experimental evidence suggests that
electrons spin about their axes as
move
throughout the volume of
their atoms. Like a
top, an electron can spin in one of two directions,
each direction generating a magnetic field. The spin quantum number
(ms) specifies the direction in which the electron is spinning: This
quantum number has only two possible values: +2
or

In 1925, an Austrian
physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, proposed that only two
electrons of opposite spin could occupy an orbital. This proposal became
known as the Pauli exclusion principle.
What the exclusion principle
does is place a limit on the total number of electrons that may occupy any
orbital. That is, an orbital may have a maximum of two electrons only,
each of which must have the opposite spin direction of the other: It may
also have only one electron of either
direction.
An orbital may also
have no electrons at all.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle and Quantum Numbers
Another way of stating the exclusion principle is that no two electrons
in an atom have the same four quantum numbers This important idea
means that each electron in an atom has its own
unique set of four
quantum numbers. For example, compare the quantum numbers
that distinguish a ground state hydrogen atom from a helium atom. (Recall
that a helium atom has two electrons. Note also that ms quantum number

Consider the significance of lithium's quantum numbers. The first two
electrons occupy the 1s orbital, and have the same sets of quantum
numbers as helium's two electrons.
According to the Pauli exclusion
principle, the 1s orbital (n
=
1) is now

full:
because it contains the
maximum number of electrons: two. For lithium's third electron, n
cannot equal 1. Therefore, the next principal energy level for the electron
is n = 2. If n = 2, I may have a value of 0 Or 1
Remember that an atom's
ground state represents its lowest energy state. Because an orbital with
1 = 0 (an $ orbital) has a lower energy than an orbital with 1 = 1
(a p orbital), you would expect a high probability of finding lithium's
third electron in the s orbital given by n = 2, 1 = 0. In fact,
experimental
evidence supports this expectation. You know that if 1 = 0 ,
m has only
one
possible value: 0. Finally by convention, ms is +2
It is
possible to distinguish atoms by writing sets of quantum numbers
for each of their electrons. However; writing quantum numbers for an
atom such as uranium, which has 92 electrons, would be mind-bogglingly

tedious. Fortunately, chemists have developed a

An atom's electron configuration is & shorthand notation that shows
the number and arrangement of electrons in its orbitals. Because the
value of n ranges to infinity, there are an infinite number of electron

to Figure 3.19 a8 you work your way through the information that follows.
Guidelines for "Filling"
Orbitals
1. Place electrons into the orbitals in order of
increasing energy level.
2. Each set of orbitals of the same energy level must be completely
filled before proceeding to the next orbital or series of orbitals.
3. Whenever electrons are added to orbitals of the same energy sub-
level,
orbital receives one electron before any pairing occurs_
4
When electrons are added singly to separate orbitals of the same
energy, the electrons must all have the same spin.
Guidelines 3 and 4 together comprise what is known as Hund's rule.
If you
obey" Hund's rule, no two electrons can have the same set of
quantum numbers Thus, this rule follows from Pauli's exclusion principle.

Writing Electron Configurations for Periods 1 and 2
Below are the electron configurations for atoms of the first ten elements,
along with their orbital diagrams.
Figure 3.20 presents the same basic information about the first ten
elements, arranged in the form of the periodic table. Using these electron
configurations, orbital diagrams, and Figure 3.20, you can probably follow
the logic that leads to the electronic structure of each atom.
As you
examine and compare this information, note the following:
The energy of each orbital (or each group of orbitals) increases as you
move
from left to right:
Boron 's fifth electron must go into the 2p energy sublevel. Since 1 = 1,
m] may be -1, 0, Or +1
The fifth electron can go into any of these
orbitals, because
all have the same energy: When you draw orbital
diagrams, it is customary to place the electron in the first available box,
from left to right:
With carbon, you must apply Hund's rule: In other words, carbon's sixth
electron must go into the next
unoccupied 2p orbital. (Experimental
evidence confirms that the
of this sixth electron

same direction as the fifth electron.)
With oxygen, as with helium's 1s orbital and beryllium's 28 orbital, the
last-added (eighth) electron is paired with a 2p electron of opposite

Electron Configurations and Orbital Diagrams for Period 3
To write the electron configurations and draw the orbital diagrams for
atoms of Period 3 elements, you follow the same process as for Period 2_
The practice problems below give you the chance to write and draw these
representations. In

pattern that enables you to

in
writing electron configurations. As the atomic number
increases, electron configurations become longer and longer: You know
that chemical reactivity depends mainly on an atom's valence electrons:
the electrons in the outermost-occupied principle energy level. To
highlight these electrons, you can
use &
simplified notation called a
condensed electron configuration. This notation places the electron
configuration of the noble gas of the previous period in square brackets,
its atomic
symbol only. Then
continue with the configuration of
the next energy level that is
filled.
The condensed electron configuration for a nitrogen atom, for
example, is [He]2s"2p?.
The notation [He] is used to represent 1s2
For a

Here, [Ne] represents, 1s22822p6

energy sublevel  However; when

equal 0, 1, and 2. Perhaps
you wondered what happened to the 3d orbitals (1 = 2).
Electrons do not start occupying 3d orbitals until the 4s orbital is
filled. Therefore, the 3d orbitals are filled starting in period 4.
The reason
for this change in the expected orbital filling order is that the 4s orbital
has a lower energy than the 3d orbitals. Remember that usually you fill
orbitals in order of increasing energy: (If necessary, refer to the Guidelines
for
Filling" Orbitals and Figure 3.19 to refresh your memory)
The chart below shows electron configurations and partial orbital
diagrams for the 18 elements of

You would expect the
pattern shown for potassium (Z
=
19) through vanadium (Z = 23).
However; an unexpected deviation from the pattern occurs with chromi-
um (Z = 24).
The same thing happens with copper (Z = 29). All other
configurations for
4 conform to the aufbau principle.
Why do Cr and Cu have electron configurations that are different from
what you would predict? The guidelines that you have been using state
that you fill orbitals according to increasing energy: In most cases, this
results in the most stable ground state configuration for the atom.
Experimental evidence indicates, however; that some atoms achieve
greater stability with electron configurations that do not conform to
predicted patterns. For chromium, the greatest ground state stability
results from a configuration in which its 4s and 3d orbitals are half-filled.
For copper; a half-filled 4s orbital and a completely filled set of 3d orbitals
gives the most stable configuration_
Similar situations arise for a number
of atoms in the
remaining periods.

Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table
So far; you have "built up
atoms of the first 36 elements of the periodic
table_
There are more than 80 elements still
remaining: You do not,
however; have to build up atoms of these elements to write their electron
configurations You can do it simply by consulting the periodic table!
All you need is to recognize the significance of several patterns. You have
already observed
of these.
In the process of examining the patterns outlined below; you will
learn the filling order for atoms of elements in periods 5, 6, and 7_
You
will also see why the shape and organization of the periodic table is a
direct consequence of the electronic structure of the atoms.
Arranging Elements by Electron Configurations
Figure 3.21 on the next page shows the entire periodic table, with certain
segments colour-coded and labelled according to the type of orbital that
is
being filled. If you built up an atom of every element,
orbitals in
order of increasing energy, YoU would construct a chart with precisely this
shape and organization. Figure 3.22 highlights the filling order, and there-
fore the energy order; of the orbitals when you read the periodic table
from left to right:
Elements that appear in the s block and the p block are called either
the main group elements or the representative elements. Chemists give
them these names because, collectively, these elements are representative
of a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Among the main
group elements, for example, you will find metals, non-metals, metalloids,

Patterns Involving Group Numbers and Period Numbers
Elements in a group have similar chemical properties because
have
similar outer electron configurations. That is,
have the same number
of valence electrons. This observation gives rise to three patterns that you
can deduce from the
periodic table.
For main group elements, the last numeral of the group number is the

same as the number of valence electrons.
For
example, phosphorus in

Atoms of elements that have electrons with n = 6 appear in
energy order of the atomic orbitals.
6.
The square of the n value (n2) equals the total number of orbitals in
that energy level. Furthermore, since each orbital may have a maximum
of two electrons, the maximum number of electrons in any principle
energy level is 2n2 . For example, with n = 2, there are four orbitals: one
2s orbital and three
orbitals. Squaring the n value gives 22 = 4.
The
total number of electrons in this energy level is eight, given by 2n2 .
Notice that there are eight elements in period 2_
This is no coincidence.
Compare this result with the next period. Does the pattern hold? For
period 3 elements, n = 3. The number of orbitals is n2 = 9. (Verify that
for yourself:) The number of electrons is
=
18. However, there are
only eight elements in period 3. Why? The 48 orbital has a lower energy
than the 3p orbitals, and thus fills first: The 3d orbitals fill after the 4s
orbitals. Therefore, there are 18 elements in

Recall that the 4f
orbitals do not fill until after the 6s orbital fills.

Periodic Trends in Atomic Radius
As you know, atoms are not solid
spheres. Their volumes (the extent of
their orbitals) are described in terms of probabilities. Nevertheless, the
size of an atom
its atomic radius
is a measurable property Chemists
can determine it by measuring the distance between the nuclei of bonded,
neighbouring atoms For example, for metals, atomic radius is half the
distance between neighbouring nuclei in a crystal of the metal element.
For elements that occur as molecules, which is the case for many non-
metals, atomic radius is half the distance between nuclei of identical
atoms that bonded together with a single covalent bond. In Figure 3.23,
the radii of metallic elements represent the radius of an atom in a metallic
crystal. The radii of all other elements represent the radius of an atom of
the element participating in a single covalent bond with one additional,
like atom_

Unit 2  Structure and Properties
Figure 3.23 shows the periodic trends associated with the atomic
radius.
You can see that atomic radii generally decrease across
a
Furthermore, atomic radii generally increase down a group. Two factors
affect differences in atomic radii.
One factor
affecting atomic radii is changing n. As n increases, there
is a
higher probability of finding electrons farther from their nucleus.
Therefore, the atomic volume is larger: In other words, atomic radius
tends to increase with
increasing
n, and decrease with decreasing n_
The other factor that affects atomic radii is changing nuclear
specifically, the effective nuclear charge. Effective nuclear charge is the
net force of attraction between electrons and the nucleus
surround:
Only hydrogen's single electron experiences the full positive charge of
its nucleus_
For hydrogen, the nuclear charge experienced by the electron
is Z, its atomic number: For all other atoms, the nuclear charge that any
given electron experiences is offset to some degree by other electrons
Depending on the electron density between the nucleus and any
particular electron, the net force of attraction -the effective nuclear
charge , Zeff
may be large o small.
As
increases, electrons are attracted more strongly to the nucleus,
and the size of the atom decreases.
As Zeff decreases, electrons experience
a
reduced force of attraction, and the size of the atom increases.
Valence
electrons, especially, experience a smaller Zeff than inner electrons
because the inner electrons shield or screen them from the attractive force
of the nucleus_
For the main group elements, the combined influences of n, Zeff, and
this
shielding effect have the following outcomes.
n governs the trend of increasing atomic radius down a group. Down a
group, atoms of each subsequent element have one more level of inner
electrons, increasing the shielding effect. Because of the additional
shielding, Zetr for the valence electrons changes only slightly The
increase in atomic size, therefore, results from the increasing value of n.
Zeff governs the trend of decreasing atomic radius across
a
period.
Across a
period, atoms of each element have one more electron added
to the same outer energy level
n
does not change.
The
shielding effect
changes only slightly However; Zeff changes considerably The decrease
in atomic size across &
period, therefore, results from increasing Zeff:
The atoms of transition elements do not display the same general trend as
the main group elements.
A
reason for this is that electrons are added
to inner energy levels
the d orbitals
rather than to the outer energy
levels.
As a result, Zeff changes relatively little, so atomic size remains
fairly constant. In later chemistry courses, you will learn a more complete
explanation for the atomic radii of transition-element atoms.
Periodic Trends in lonization Energy
For the hydrogen atom,
the difference in energy between n
= 1
and n =
represents the energy change associated with the complete removal of its
electron. (By convention, when n =
O .
an electron is considered to be
completely removed from its atom.) The energy needed to completely
remove one electron from a ground state gaseous atom is called the
ionization energy. Energy must be added to the atom to remove an
electron in order to overcome the force of attraction exerted on the
electron by the nucleus. Since multi-electron atoms have two Or more
electrons,

gaseous atom's first ionization energy is the least energy required to
remove an electron from the outermost
occupied energy level: The second
ionization energy is always greater than the first ionization energy,
because the electron must be removed from a positively charged ion.
The
same
reasoning applies for successive ionization energies.
First ionization energy (IE1) is closely linked to an atom's chemical
reactivity Atoms with a low

tions_

involving first ionization energy
Atomic number
Figure 3.24 illustrates several trends associated with ionization energy:
Ionization energy generally decreases down a group. Notice that this
trend is the inverse of the trend for atomic radius. The two trends are,
in fact, linked. As atomic radius increases, the distance of valence
electrons from the nucleus also increases. There is a decrease, therefore,
in the force of attraction exerted by the nucleus on the valence
electrons. Thus, less energy is needed to remove one such electron.
Ionization energy generally increases across a
Again, this trend
is linked to the atomic radius.
Across a
period, the atomic radius
decreases because Zeff increases. The force of attraction between the
nucleus and valence electrons is subsequently increased. Therefore,
more energy is needed to remove one such electron.
Several minor variations in these trends occur: The variations involve
boron and aluminum in group 13 (IIIA) and oxygen and sulfur in group 16
(VIA): The
in
with group 13 occurs because electrons start to fill
the np orbitals.
These orbitals are higher in energy than the ns orbital, so
the additional electron is more easily removed. Group 16 marks the first
pairing of the p orbital electrons. The np? configuration of nitrogen is
more stable than the npt configuration of oxygen. Electron repulsions

increase the orbital energy in oxygen. Therefore, less energy is required to
remove the fourth p sublevel electron in oxygen.
Periodic trends in ionization energy are linked to trends involving the
reactivity of metals. In general, the chemical reactivity of metals increases
down a group and decreases across a
These trends, as well as a
further trend from metallic to non-metallic properties across a period, and
increasing metallic properties down a group, are shown in Table 3.1.

Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity
Electron
affinity is the change in energy that occurs when an electron is
added to a gaseous atom.
As was the case with ionization energy, there is
more than one value for electron affinity. The first electron affinity results
in the formation of an anion with a
charge of 1--
For example, when a
neutral fluorine atom acquires an electron, as in a bonding situation,
the
resulting electron configuration of the fluoride ion is the same as that
of the noble gas, neon:

Figure 3.25
Electron affinities for the main group elements. Negative values mean that
anions form with the release of energy Positive values mean that energy is absorbed in order
to form the anion. The positive values are estimated, because the anions formed for atoms of
groups 2 and 18 are unstable.
Figure 3.25 shows electron affinities for atoms of the main group ele-
ments. Positive values mean that energy is
required to add an electron.
Negative values mean that energy is given off when an electron is added.
High negative numbers mean a high electron affinity Low negative num-
bers and positive numbers mean a low electron affinity:
Trends for electron affinity are more irregular than those for atomic
radius and ionization energy because factors other than atomic size and
Zeff are involved. In future chemistry courses, you will learn about these
factors and how
explain the irregularities. However; the property of
electron affinity is still significant when
consider it in combination
with ionization energy: The trends that result from this combination are
important for chemical bonding:
Atoms of elements in group 17 (VIIA), and to a lesser degree group 16
(VIA), have high ionization energies and high electron affinities. As
a
result, it takes a great deal of energy to remove electrons from these
atoms. However; these atoms attract electrons strongly, and form
negative ions in ionic compounds.

Section Summary
In this section, you have seen how a theoretical idea, the quantum
mechanical model of the atom,
explains the experimentally determined
structure of the periodic table, and the properties of its elements. Your
understanding of the four quantum numbers enabled you to write electron
configurations and draw orbital diagrams for atoms of the elements
You
also learned how to sread" the
periodic table to deduce the electron con-
figuration of any element:
Since the start of high school science courses,
have used the
periodic table to help you investigate the composition and behaviour of
the elements. Your early experiences with the periodic table were limited
largely to the first 20 elements, because you could
explain their electron
structure without the concepts of orbitals and electron configurations.
The modern, quantum mechanical model of the atom has broadened
your understanding of the elements, the composition of their atoms,
and their chemical and physical behaviour in the world around you.
You will draw upon these concepts in the next chapter; a8 you expand
your
understanding of the forces that are responsible for the millions of
kinds of matter in the universe: chemical bonds.

Properties of Ionic Solids
Magnesium fluoride has many properties that are characteristic of ionic
solids. In general, ionic solids have the following properties:

Many ionic solids are also soluble in water: Magnesium fluoride, however;
is an
exception. It has & very low solubility in water:

The amount of energy
off when an ionic crystal forms from the
gaseous ions of its elements is called the lattice energy. Thus, the lattice
energy of MgFz is 2957 kJImol. The same amount of energy must be
added to break the ionic crystal back into its gaseous ions. What is the
relationship between lattice energy and the formation of an ionic bond?
For
example, when solid magnesium and gaseous fluorine react to form
magnesium fluoride, the energy change is 1123 kJ/mol. How does this
energy change relate to magnesium fluoride's lattice energy of 2957 k)Imol?

mainly by its large lattice energy: The lattice energies
of the magnesium halides decrease from fluoride to iodide:

A covalent bond involves

the formation of a new orbital, caused by the overlapping of atomic
orbitals. The new orbital has energy levels that are lower than those of
the original atomic orbitals. Since electrons tend to occupy the lowest
available energy level, the new orbitals provide a more energetically

Bond energy is the energy required to break the force of attraction
between two atoms in a bond and to separate them. Thus, bond energy
is a measure of the strength of a bond. You might expect that the bond
energy would increase if more electrons were shared between two atoms
because there would be an increase in charge density between the nuclei
of the bonded atoms In other words, you might predict that double bonds
are
stronger than single bonds, and that triple bonds are stronger than
double bonds. The data in Table 4.1 support this prediction.

being composed of a densely packed core of metallic cations, within a

of valence
electrons that moves among them constitutes a metallic bond.
Properties Explained by the Free-Electron Model

The free-electron model explains many properties of metals. For example:
Conductivity: Metals are
conductors of electricity and heat because
electrons can move freely throughout the metallic structure. This freedom
of movement is not
possible in solid ionic compounds, because the
valence electrons are held within the individual ionic bonds in the lattice.
Malleability and Ductility: The malleability of metals can be explained

stronger metallic bonding forces. This trend is also consistent with the
fact that Group 2 metals are smaller in size than Group 1 metals. Trends
involving the transition metals are more
complex, in part because
have a greater number of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. Because
these d electrons and those of the valence energy level have similar
magnitudes, the d electrons can participate in metallic bonding: In
general, however; transition elements have very high melting and
boiling

How To Draw Lewis Structures for Simple Molecules and Ions with
a
Central Atom
Step 1
Position the least electronegative atom in the centre of the
molecule or polyatomic ion. Write the other atoms around this
central atom, with each atom bonded to the central atom by a
single bond. Always place a hydrogen atom or a fluorine atom
at an end
position in the structure.
Step 2 (a) Determine the total number of valence electrons in the
molecule Or ion. For
polyatomic ions, pay close attention
to the
charge. For example, if you are drawing a polyatomic
anion such as CO32 -
add two electrons to the total number
of valence electrons calculated for the structure CO3 . For a
polyatomic cation such as NH4+
subtract one electron from
the total number of valence electrons calculated for the
structure NH4.
(b) Once you have the total number of valence electrons,
determine the total number of electrons needed for each
atom to achieve a noble gas electron configuration.

obey
(c) Subtract the first total (number of valence electrons) from the
second total (number of electrons needed to satisfy the octet
rule) to
the number of shared electrons. Then divide this
number by 2 to give the number of bonds. Double o triple
bonds may be needed to account for this number of bonds.
Double bonds count as two bonds. Triple bonds count as
three bonds.
Step 3  Subtract the number of shared electrons from the number of
valence electrons to
the number of non-bonding electrons.
Add these electrons as lone
to the atoms
surrounding
the central atom so that you achieve a noble gas electron
configuration for each atom
Sample Problem
Drawing the Lewis Structure of a Molecule
Problem
Draw the Lewis structure for formaldehyde (methanal), CHzO _
Solution
The molecular formula, CHzO , tells you the number of each kind
of atom in the molecule. Following steps 1 to 3 from the procedure
outlined above:
1
Since H is always
at the end
position and C is less
electronegative than 0, C should be the central atom_
Place
the other atoms around C, attached by single bonds.
HC-H
Step 2
Determine the total number of valence electrons:
(1 C atom X 4 e /C atom) + (1 0 atom X 6 e /0 atom)
+
(2 H atoms X 1 e /H atom)
=4 e + 6 e
+ 2 e
=
12 e
Then, determine the total number of electrons
required for each
atom in the structure to achieve a noble gas configuration
This
would be 8 e  for C and 8 e  for 0 (to fill their respective valence
energy levels) and 2 e
for each H (to fill its 1s orbital):
So the total
number for CHzO is:
(2 atoms X 8 e-/atom) + (2 atoms X 2 e-/atom) = 20 e
To find the number of shared electrons, subtract the first total
from the second_
20 e
12 e = 8 e
Now divide the number of shared electrons by two to obtain the
number of bonds.
20 e
12 e = 8 e + 2 = 4 covalent bonds
Since there are only three atoms surrounding the central atom,
you can infer that one of the bonds is likely a double bond:

Step 3
Determine the number of non-bonding electrons by subtracting
the number of shared electrons from the total number of valence

Check Your Solution
Each atom has achieved a noble gas electron configuration. Thus,
you can be confident that this is a reasonable Lewis structure.
Co-ordinate Covalent Bonds
You know that a covalent bond involves the sharing of a
of electrons
between two atoms; each atom contributes one electron to the shared
In some cases, such as the hydronium ion, H3Ot
one atom contributes
both of the electrons to the shared
The bond in these cases is called
a cO-ordinate covalent bond In terms of the quantum mechanical model, a
co-ordinate covalent bond forms when a filled atomic orbital overlaps with
an
empty atomic orbital: Once a co-ordinate bond is formed, it behaves in
the same way as any other single covalent bond: The next Sample Problem

The condensed electron configuration
for nitrogen is [Ne] 2s22pa
Each nitrogen atom has only three unpaired
2p electrons in three half-filled orbitals available for bonding: Since there
are four covalent bonds shown around nitrogen in the Lewis structure,
electrons in one of the bonds must have come from the filled orbitals of
nitrogen. Therefore, one of the bonds around the central nitrogen atom
must be a co-ordinate covalent bond.
Resonance Structures: More Than One Possible Lewis Structure
Imagine that you are asked to draw the Lewis structure for sulfur dioxide,
SOz. A typical answer would look like this:
:0~s_0:
This Lewis structure suggests that SOz contains a single bond and
a double bond. However; experimental measurements of bond lengths
indicate that the bonds between the S and each 0 are identical: The two
bonds have properties that are somewhere between & single bond and a
6(
double bond: In effect, the SOz molecule contains two
one-and-a-half"
bonds.
To communicate the bonding in SOz more accurately, chemists
draw two Lewis structures and insert a double-headed arrow between
them _
Each of these Lewis structures is called a resonance structure.
Resonance structures are models that give the same relative position of
atoms as in Lewis structures, but show different places for their bonding
and lone

pairs.
Many molecules and ions
especially organic ones--require
resonance structures to represent their bonding: It is essential to bear
in mind, however; that resonance structures do not exist in reality. For
example, SOz does not shift back and forth from one structure to the
other  An actual SOz molecule is a combination--a hybrid--of its two
resonance structures. It is more properly referred to as a resonance hybrid.

You could think of resonance hybrids as being like
mutts.
For example,
a

spaniel and a beagle (a
'speagle") is part
spaniel and part beagle. It does not exist as a spaniel one moment and a
beagle the next: Instead, a speagle is an average, of sorts, between the two
breeds. Similarly, a resonance hybrid is a
weighted average between two
or more resonance structures.

Central Atoms with an Expanded Valence Level
The octet rule allows a maximum of four bonds (a total of eight electrons)
to form around an atom. Based upon bond energies, however; chemists
have suggested that the bonding in some molecules (and polyatomic ions)
is best explained by a model that shows more than eight electrons in the
valence energy level of the central atom. This central atom is said to have
an
expanded valence energy level. One example of a molecule with an
expanded valence energy level is phosphorus pentachloride, PCls _
This
substance is a pungent; pale-yellow powder that is used in the agricultural,
pharmaceutical, and dyeing industries. Organic chemists also use reactions
with PCls to identify compounds that contain hydroxyl groups.

Until recently, chemists explained bonding in molecules such as PCl5
by assuming that empty d orbitals of the central atom were involved.
However; experimental evidence does not support this idea. Current
thinking suggests that larger atoms can accommodate additional valence
electrons because of their size. The theory behind this idea goes beyond
the scope of this textbook Assume that the octet rule usually applies
when drawing Lewis structures for simple molecules. Sometimes,
however; you must violate the rule to allow for more than four bonds
around a central atom.

Shapes and Polarity of Molecules
Up to now, you have represented molecules using Lewis structures.
These two-dimensional, formula-like diagrams help you count and
track of valence electrons, and communicate essential information about
the
placement and bonding of atoms O ions in a molecule. Chemists often
draw Lewis structures in a way that suggests the shape of a molecule.
However; this is not their function. It is important to remember that Lewis
structures do not communicate any information about a molecule's
To represent the shapes of real molecules, you need a model that depicts
them in three-dimensions.
In 1957 ,
an
English chemist, Ronald Gillespie, joined Hamilton,
Ontario's McMaster University for a
distinguished career as a
professor of chemistry. Earlier that year; Gillespie, in collaboration with
a
colleague, Ronald Nyholm, developed a model for predicting the
of molecules. Like chemistry students around the world since that time,
you are about to learn the central features of this model, called the
Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion theory This is usually abbreviated
to VSEPR (pronounced "vesper") theory: (Note that some chemists use the
66
term
shell
instead of energy level to describe atomic orbitals.)
Introducing Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory
The fundamental principle of the Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion
theory is that the bonding
and
non-bonding
of electrons
in the valence level of an atom repel one another:
As you know, electron
of atoms are localized in orbitals, which are
shapes that describe the
space in which electrons are most likely to be found around a nucleus
The orbital for each electron
is positioned as far apart from the other
orbitals as
possible.

Therefore, the BP-BP
repulsions
are
smaller
than the LP_ LP
repulsions. The repulsion between a bond
and a
lone-pair (BP _~LP) has a
magnitude intermediate between the other two.
In other words, in terms of decreasing repulsion:
LP _
LP > LP_BP > BP_-BP
In Unit 1, you encountered the tetrahedral
around a single-
bonded carbon atom, the trigonal planar
around a carbon atom
with one double bond, and the linear
around a carbon atom with
a
triple bond.
These shapes result from repulsions between lone
and bonding
of electrons. Now you will use your
understanding of
LP and BP
repulsions to
the
shapes you learned in Unit 1, and
to predict the shapes of other molecules. Figure 4.11 shows the five basic
geometrical arrangements that result from the interactions of lone
and
bonding
around a central atom. These arrangements involve up
to six electron groups.
An electron group is usually one of the following:
a
single bond
a double bond
a
triple bond
a lone
Each of the electron-group arrangements in Figure 4.11 results in a
minimum total energy for the molecule. Variations in these arrangements
are
possible, depending on whether a
bonding
Or a lone
occupies
a
specific position. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
electron-group arrangement and molecular shape. Electron-group
arrangement refers to the ways in which groups of valence electrons
are
positioned around the central atom. Molecular
refers to the
relative positions of the atomic nuclei in a molecule.
When all the
electron groups are
bonding pairs ,
a molecule will have one of the five
geometrical arrangements shown in Figure 4.11. If one or more of the
electron groups include a lone

five geometric arrangements result:

The
Relationship Between Molecular
and Molecular Polarity
A molecule' s
and polarity are directly related. As you know, the
electronegativity difference between two atoms is the principal factor
that determines the type of chemical bonding between them.
As you saw
in section 4.1, when atoms of two different elements have AEN between
0.5 and 1.7 , the bond between them is
covalent: The electrons are
shared unequally between the two types of atoms. For example, in the
HCL molecule, the Cl atom is more electronegative than the H atom. Thus,
the CL atom exerts & stronger force of attraction on the shared
of
electrons. As a result; the Cl end of the bond develops a partial negative
charge (8-) and the H end develops a partial positive charge (8+). This
polarity in a bond is called a bond dipole. The vector used to represent a
bond dipole
toward the more electronegative element. For exam-
ple, you could represent the polarity of the bond in hydrogen chloride as:

H:Cl:

For a diatomic molecule such as HCl,

the angles at which the dipoles come together Thus, molecular

is a term used to describe the charge separation
for the entire molecule.
Consider; for example, BeFz, which is a symmetrical, linear molecule.
Each Be-~F bond is
(because fluorine has a greater electronegativity
than beryllium) Due to the linear
of this molecule, however;
the
polarities of the two bonds are directly opposite each other: The
two
bonding polarities exactly counteract each other; so that BeFz is &
non-polar molecule. The

of its individual bonds, therefore, determine polarity:

such as water because of ion-dipole forces. An ion-dipole force is the
force of attraction between an ion and a
molecule (a dipole). For
example, NaCl dissolves in water because the attractions between the Nat
and Cl- ions and the water molecules provide enough energy to overcome
the forces that bind the ions together: Figure 4.14 shows how ion-dipole
forces dissolve any type of soluble ionic compound.

In aqueous solution, ionic solids dissolve as the
negative ends and the positive
ends of the water molecules become oriented with the corresponding oppositely charged ions
that make up the ionic compound, pulling them away from the solid into solution:
Induced Intermolecular Forces
Induction of electric charge occurs when a
on one object causes a
change in the distribution of charge on a nearby object. Rubbing a balloon
to make it "stick" to a wall is an example of
charging by induction. There
are two types of charge-induced dipole forces.
An ion-induced dipole force results when an ion in close proximity
to a
non-polar molecule distorts the electron density of the non-polar
molecule
The molecule then becomes momentarily polarized, and the
two
species are attracted to each other: This force is active during every
moment of your life, in the bonding between non-polar Oz molecules
and the Fe2t ion in hemoglobin: Ion-induced dipole forces, therefore, are
part of the process that transports vital oxygen throughout your
A
dipole-induced dipole force is similar to that of an ion-induced
dipole force.
In this case, however; the charge on a
molecule is
responsible for inducing the charge on the non-polar molecule. Non-polar

dipole-induced dipole forces.

Dispersion (London) Forces
The shared pairs of electrons in covalent bonds are constantly vibrating:
While this
to all molecules, it is of particular interest for mole-
cules that are
non-polar: The bond vibrations, which are
of the
normal condition of a non-polar molecule, cause momentary, uneven
distributions of charge. In other words, a non-polar molecule becomes
slightly
for an instant, and continues to do this on a random but
on-going basis.
At the instant that one
non-polar molecule is in a slightly
condition, it is
capable of inducing a dipole in a nearby molecule.
An intermolecular force of attraction results.
This force of attraction is
called a dispersion force. Chemists also commonly refer to it as a London
force, in honour of the German physicist, Fritz London, who studied
this force. Unlike other intermolecular forces, dispersion (London)
forces act between any particles,
Or otherwise.
are the main
intermolecular forces that act between non-polar molecules, as shown in
Figure 4.15.
Two factors affect the magnitude of dispersion forces. One is the
number of electrons in the molecule and the other is the shape of the
molecule_
Vibrations within larger molecules that have more electrons
than smaller molecules can easily cause an uneven distribution of
charge.
The dispersion forces between these larger molecules are thus stronger;
which has the effect of raising the boiling
for larger molecules.
A
molecule with a
spherical shape has a smaller surface area than & straight
chain molecule that has the same number of electrons. The smaller
surface area allows less opportunity for the molecule to induce a charge
on a
nearby molecule. Therefore, for two substances with molecules that

How dispersion forces develop between identical non-polar molecules In A,
neither molecule interacts with the other: In B, one molecule becomes, instantaneously, a
dipole. At that moment, the dipolar molecule is able to induce a temporary charge separation
in the other molecule, resulting in a force of attraction between the two. All the molecules
within a sample undergo this same process, as shown in C
Hydrogen Bonding
A
dipole-dipole interaction that is very significant in many biological
molecules and some inorganic molecules, such as HzOre), is hydrogen
bonding: Hydrogen bonding is a particularly strong form of dipole-dipole
attraction that exists between a hydrogen atom in
a
polar-bonded
molecule that contains bonds such as H-0, H--N, or H--F, and an
unshared pair of electrons on another small, electronegative atom such
as

When hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, fluorine, Or nitrogen, the

or F
You can see the effect of hydrogen bonding clearly in the boiling
point data of the binary hydrides of Groups 14 to 17 (IVA to VIIA), shown
in Figure 4.16. In Group 14, the trend in boiling
is as
expected.
The increase in boiling point from methane, CH4 ,
to tin(IV) hydride,
SnH4, is due to an increase in the number of electrons. Therefore, there
are
larger dispersion forces, since more electrons are able to temporarily
shift from one part of the molecule to another In SnH4, this results in
greater intermolecular forces of attraction.
There is no hydrogen bonding
in these substances, because there are no lone
on the molecules.
However; the hydrides of Groups 15, 16, and 17 (VA to VIIA) only
show the
expected trend based on dispersion forces for the larger mass
hydrides. The smallest mass hydrides, NH:, HzO, and HF, have relatively
high boiling points, indicating strong intermolecular forces caused by
hydrogen bonding:
is there no hydrogen bonding in HzS and HzSe, which have
unshared electron
on their central atoms? Neither S nor Se is small
enough or electronegative enough to support hydrogen bonding: Thus,
HzO (with its small and very electronegative 0 atom) has a much higher
boiling
than H2S and HzSe, as you can see in Figure 4.16.

Hydrogen Bonding and Properties of Water
Hydrogen bonding also explains water's unusual property of being less
dense in the solid state than in the liquid state:
As you know from kinetic
molecular theory, lower temperatures cause liquid molecules to move
slower than in their gaseous states.
When liquids solidify, the kinetic
energy of the particles is no longer enough to prevent the intermolecular
forces of attraction from
causing particles to stick together: For most
substances, their solid states are denser than their liquid states.
When
water freezes, however; the water molecules
in such a way that the
solid state is less dense than the liquid state. Water molecules align in a
specific pattern s0 that hydrogen atoms of one molecule are oriented
toward the oxygen atom of another molecule.
You can see this clearly in
Figure 4.18. If water molecules behaved as most molecules do, then lake
water would freeze from the bottom up, rather than from the
down_
The consequences for aquatic life, and on organisms (like us) that depend
on
aquatic ecosystems, would be profound. A lake that freezes from the
bottom up would solidify completely, killing most of the life it contains

Bonding in Solids
In Investigation 4-A, you classified solid substances on the basis of the
types of bonds that hold their molecules or ions together: This is not,
however, the only way to classify solids. Chemists also divide solids
into two categories based on the macroscopic properties that arise
from the arrangements of their component particles. Crystalline solids
have organized particle arrangements, s0
have distinct
shapes.
Gemstones such as
amethyst and garnet are examples of crystalline
solids. Amorphous solids have indistinct shapes, because their particle
arrangements lack order: Glass and rubber are common
amorphous solids
In the next few pages,
will learn about the structure and properties
of crystalline and amorphous solids.
Bonding and Properties of Crystalline Solids
Chemists further classify crystalline solids into five types, based on
their composition. These types are atomic, molecular; network, ionic,
and metallic  Since you have already learned about metallic solids, the
material that follows concentrates on the other four crystalline solids.
You will find a summary of their properties in Table 4.5, following these
descriptions.

Atomic Solids
Atomic solids are made up of individual atoms that are held together
by dispersion forces. The number of naturally occurring atomic
solids is
small In fact, the noble gases in their solid state are the
only examples. Since the only forces holding atomic solids together are
dispersion forces, these solids have very low melting and boiling
Molecular Solids
Molecular solids are, as their name implies, made up of molecules. Like
atomic solids, the molecules that make up molecular solids, such as
frozen methane, are held together mainly by dispersion forces.
Consequently,
tend to have low
melting and boiling points. In
molecular solids, however, stronger dipole-dipole forces, and sometimes
hydrogen bonding, give these compounds higher melting points and
boiling
than non-polar molecular solids. For example, the melting
of
non-polar propane, C3Hs,
is -190*C. A molecule of
formic
acid, HCOOH, which has a similar number of electrons and the same
molar mass as propane, melts at 8.4 C. The large difference in boiling
is due to the hydrogen
bonding and dipole-dipole forces in formic
acid. You will often see molecular solids classified as covalent solids.
However, it is clearer to classify them as molecular solids, because
network solids, which you will see below, also contain covalent bonds.
Network Solids
Unlike the intramolecular covalent bonds that hold atoms together in
discrete molecules, it is possible for atoms to bond covalently into
continuous two- o three-dimensional arrays, called network solids.
A wide range of properties can be found among network solids.
Carbon-Based Network Solids

the covalent C__C bonds, gives diamond its extreme hardness, and makes
it inert to corrosive chemicals.
Fullerenes make up a group of

Nanotubes of C4oo and higher may have
applications in the manufacture
of high-strength fibres. In the year 2000, researchers built a nanotube with

However; unlike the bonding that occurs in COz, the silicon
atom in silica does not form a double bond with an oxygen

The likely reason is that silicon's 3p orbital is too
large to overlap effectively with a 2p orbital of the oxygen
atom. Instead, each silicon atom bonds to four oxygen
atoms to give a tetrahedral network with shared oxygen
atoms, as shown in Figure 4.20. The network is represented

Determining the Type of Bonding in Substances
The type of bonding in a substance depends upon the kinds of atoms it
contains and the forces of attraction between those atoms. If you know
the physical properties of a substance, you can often predict the type of
bonding in the substance.

A Material Made to Order: Intermolecular and Intramolecular
Forces in Action
The gloves in the photograph at the start of this chapter are anything but
ordinary. The thin, lightweight fabric can withstand startling impacts and
piercing forces, including small projectiles such as bullets. In fact, this
same fabric is used to make bulletproof vests. The
strands of fibre
6(
used to make such protective gear are interlaced to form a dense
net:
that is
capable of absorbing
amounts of energy. You have probably
heard the trade name for this astounding fibre: KEVLAR@. It was invented
by an American research chemist, Stephanie Kwolek, in 1965.
The secret to stopping a bullet with a fairly soft fabric is that it
behaves in much the same way as the
netting on the
frame used in
hockey: When a hockey
strikes a net at 100 km/h, its kinetic energy
is transferred to the lengths of twine of the
net: This twine is an
interlaced mesh that has strands which stretch horizontally and vertically
to
disperse the energy of impact over & wide area.
The sample principle applies to KEVLAR@. It belongs to a class
of fibres called aramids, which are polymers containing aromatic
and amide groups.
The polymer forms in the condensation reaction
between terephthalic acid and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine, as shown in
Figure 4.24A. The strength of the polymer comes from the intramolecular
forces in the aromatic group that limit bond rotation in the straight chains,
and the amide linkage that leads to intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between the straight chains, as shown in Figure 4.24B.

In addition to stopping a bullet from penetrating the armour; a
bulletproof vest must also protect the body from the blunt force of impact:
A
bulletproof vest cannot have as much
'give" as
a
hockey net (that is, it
should not stretch back as much as hockey nets do upon impact).
Otherwise, its wearer would still be injured, even though the bullet might
not pierce the fabric: To accomplish this, the properties of KEVLAR@ are
enhanced by twisting the strands to increase their density and thickness
The strands are then woven very tightly.
A resin
coating is applied and
sandwiched between two layers of plastic film: Each layer acts as a net
and slows down the bullet a little at a time until it has been stopped:
Deriving Theory from Application: Superconductors
When she first synthesized KEVLAR@, Stephanie Kwolek did not know
that it would eventually be used in bulletproof vests o protective gloves.
She did, however; understand the theories behind the properties that
make it suitable for such
applications--the theories of intermolecular
and intramolecular forces. This is not always the case_

the current continues to flow through the circuit indefinitely, without ever
diminishing: Also, superconductors have the ability to completely repel
magnetic field lines. This means that a magnet placed over a supercon-
ductor hovers in mid-air; a8 shown in Figure 4.25.

Since Onnes's discovery, chemists have discovered other metals that
superconduct at extremely low temperatures. A niobum metal
was
found to exhibit superconductivity at 23 K, for example. But scientists
wanted to find materials that exhibit superconductivity at much higher
temperatures, because refrigerants like liquid helium are very expensive.
In 1986, materials containing copper oxide ions were discovered to
be superconductors at 30 K This was an astounding discovery, because
these materials are insulators at room temperature and higher: Researchers
began experimenting with this new class of superconductors, tweaking
their composition, and soon developed a material (TlzBazCazCugO1o) that
superconducts at 125 K This is close to the boiling
of nitrogen, a
cheaper refrigerant than liquid helium.
It would be ideal, of course, to eliminate the need for a refrigerant
altogether: Finding a material that exhibits superconductivity at room
temperature is one of the driving forces of superconductivity research,
and the search continues.
As of 2001, the highest known temperature
for a
superconductor is 138 K Researchers continue to search for new
classes of materials that superconduct: In fact, in 2001, researchers found
evidence to suggest that carbon nanotubes may superconduct, even at
temperatures surpassing the boiling
of water:
Current and Future Applications
The
properties of superconducting materials suggest & wealth of
applications. Despite the need to maintain low temperatures,
have
already found uses in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a medical
nostic tool.
have also been used to create powerful electromagnets,
used in magnetically levitated (MAGLEV) trains.
Superconductors in
the future could be used to make 100% efficient electrical wires,
allowing power plants to be built far from cities.
A
room-temperature
superconductor could also mean ultra-fast, low-power electronics.
Many of the ideas necessary to help describe and explain
superconductivity involve topics you will encounter in future chemistry
courses_
Even armed with these ideas, however; researchers do not

complete, accepted theory to
this intriguing property
Nevertheless, the list of superconducting materials continues to expand,
and
engineers continue to find practical applications for them.
Section Summary
Describing and explaining the chemical and physical changes in the
world around you requires an understanding of matter at the atomic level.
You have seen, fo example, that the concepts of intramolecular and
intermolecular forces are both needed to articulate the bonding, structure,
and properties of substances as familiar as water and as exotic as
KEVLAR@ . Each year; chemical engineers invent thousands of new
materials and substances. Each has its own characteristic structure and
properties. Each demonstrates the amazing diversity of matter that arises
from atoms, molecules and ions, and the forces among and between them.
In the next Unit, you will continue to examine chemical bonds, but
with a different
emphasis. You will learn about the energy changes that
are associated with
breaking and forming bonds. In other words, you will
examine the energy changes of chemical reactions.

Celsius degrees and Kelvin degrees are the same size. The Kelvin scale begins

Temperature is measured in either Celsius degrees (C) or kelvins (K)

That is,
study the relative enthalpy of the reactants and products in a
system. This is like saying that the distance between your home and your

You do not usually talk about the absolute position of

You talk about their relative position, in relation to each other:

Enthalpy Changes in Chemical Reactions
In chemical reactions,
enthalpy changes result from chemical bonds being
broken and formed. Chemical bonds are sources of stored energy. Breaking
a bond is a process that requires energy. Creating a bond is a process that
releases energy. For example, consider the combustion reaction that takes
place when nitrogen reacts with oxygen.
+
2NOg)
In this reaction, one mole of nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds and one mole
of oxygen-oxygen double bonds are broken.
Two moles of nitrogen-oxygen
bonds are formed This reaction absorbs energy: In other words, more
energy is released to form two nitrogen-oxygen bonds than is used to break
one nitrogen-nitrogen bond and one oxygen-oxygen bond.
When a reaction
results in a net absorption of energy, it is called an endothermic reaction.
On the other hand, when a reaction results in a net release of energy,
it is called an exothermic reaction. In an exothermic reaction, more energy
is released to form bonds than is used to break bonds. Therefore, energy is
released. Figure 5.3 shows the relationship between bond breaking, bond
formation, and endothermic and exothermic reactions.

Representing Exothermic Reactions
There are three different ways to represent the
enthalpy change of an
exothermic reaction. The simplest way is to use a thermochemical
equation: a balanced chemical equation that indicates the amount of heat
that is absorbed or released by the reaction it represents. For
example,
consider the exothermic reaction of one mole of hydrogen gas with half
a mole of oxygen gas to produce liquid water: For each mole of hydrogen
gas that reacts, 285.8 k) of heat is produced. Notice that the heat term is
included with the products because heat is produced.

Enthalpy of reaction is linearly dependent on the quantity of products
That is, if the amount of products formed doubles, the enthalpy change
also doubles. Figure 5.6 shows the relationship between the stoichiometry
of a reaction and its enthalpy change: Because of this relationship, an
exothermic reaction that is relatively safe on a small scale may be
extremely dangerous on a large scale. One of the jobs of a chemical
engineer is to design systems that allow exothermic reactions to be carried
out safely on a
scale. For example, the blast furnaces used in steel
making must withstand temperatures of up to 2000*C, produced

Hot Packs and Cold Packs:
Using the Energy of Physical Changes
You just learned about the
enthalpy changes that are associated with
changes. Another type of physical change that involves a heat
transfer is dissolution.
When a solute dissolves in
a solvent, the
enthalpy
change that occurs is called the enthalpy of solution, AHsoln. Dissolution
can be either endothermic Or exothermic.
Manufacturers take advantage of endothermic dissolution to
produce cold packs that athletes can use to treat injuries. One type of cold
contains water and a salt, such as ammonium nitrate, in separate
compartments.
When you crush the pack; the membrane that divides the
compartments breaks, and the salt dissolves. This dissolution process is
endothermic It absorbs heat for a short period of time, s0 the cold
feels cold. Figure 5.8 shows how a cold

For example, compare the mass of 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms with the
mass of the individual nucleons in
1 mol of carbon-12 atoms. The mass of
6 mol of hydrogen-1 atoms (one proton and one electron each) and 6 mol
of neutrons is 12.098 940 g. The mass of 1
mol of carbon-12 atoms is
exactly 12 g Note that the mass of the electrons does not change in a
nuclear reaction.

The difference in mass is significant: It would show up on any reasonably

The difference in mass
between a nucleus and its nucleons is known as the mass defect:

The higher the binding energy of a nucleus, the more stable the nucleus
is. Nuclei with mass numbers (A) that are close to 60 are the most stable.
Nuclear reactions, in which nuclei break apart or fuse, tend to form nuclei
that are more stable than the reactant nuclei. Figure 5.9 illustrates the

Measuring Heat Transfer in a Laboratory
From previous science courses, you will probably remember that a
calorimeter is used to measure enthalpy changes for chemical and
physical reactions.
A calorimeter works by insulating a system from its
surroundings. By measuring the temperature change of the system, you
can
determine the amount of heat that is released o absorbed by the
reaction. For
example, the heat that is released by an exothermic

changes of reactions in dilute aqueous solutions The water in the
calorimeter absorbs (or provides) the energy that is released (or absorbed)
by a chemical reaction:
When carrying out an
experiment in a dilute
solution, the solution itself absorbs o releases the energy. You can
calculate the amount of energy that is absorbed or released by the
solution
the equation mentioned earlier:
Q = m.c.AT
The mass, m; is the mass of the solution, because the solution absorbs the
heat: When a dilute aqueous solution is used in a calorimeter; you can
assume that the solution has the same density and specific heat capacity
as
pure water: As you saw above, you can also assume that the heat
capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. In other words, you can assume
that all the heat that is released or absorbed by the reaction is absorbed
Or released by the solution.

used to determine AH of a chemical reaction.

In Practice Problems 9, 11, and 12, you used experimental data to deter-

enthalpy of reaction for neutralization reactions. Neutralization
reactions are particularly well suited to analysis involving the use of a
coffee-cup calorimeter for a number of reasons:
When using dilute solutions of acids and bases, you can assume
their density is close to the density of water: Therefore, you can easily
measure the volume of the solutions and calculate their mass.
Neutralization reactions between dilute strong acids and dilute strong
bases tend to cause temperature changes in the reaction mixture that are
large enough to be measurable
a standard thermometer; but small
enough for safety
Neutralization reactions take place very quickly Therefore, the
temperature change also occurs very quickly There is little time for
heat transfer between the insulated system and the surroundings to
take

Hess's law to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction? One way is to
add equations for reactions with known enthalpy changes, so that their
net result is the reaction you are interested in_

find the
enthalpy changes of other reactions, which you can combine to
arrive at the desired reaction. In the

determine the enthalpy changes of two reactions. Then you will apply
Hess's law to determine the
enthalpy change of a third reaction.

Using Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation
You have learned how to add equations with known enthalpy changes
to obtain the enthalpy change for another equation. This method can be
time-consuming and difficult; however; because you need to find reactions
with known enthalpy changes that will add to give your target equation:
There is another way to use Hess's law to find the
enthalpy of an equation.
Formation Reactions
In Investigation 5-B, you used the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen to
form water: Reactions like this one are known as formation reactions. In a
formation reaction, a substance is formed from elements in their standard
states. The
enthalpy change of a formation reaction is called the standard
molar
enthalpy of formation, AH f The standard molar
enthalpy of forma-
tion is the quantity of energy that is absorbed or released when one mole of
0
compound is formed directly from its elements in their standard states.
Some standard molar enthalpies of formation are listed in Table 5.3.
Notice that the standard enthalpies of formation of most compounds are
negative. Thus, most compounds are more stable than the elements
are
made from.

By definition, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard

As usual, you need to begin with a balanced chemical equation. If a
given reactant O product has a molar coefficient that is not 1, you need to
multiply its AH": by the same molar coefficient This makes sense because
the units of AH' f are kJImol. Consider; for

The overall enthalpy change of any reaction is the sum of the enthalpy change
of the decomposition of the reactants to their elements and the enthalpy change of the forma-
tion of the products from their elements.
It is important to realize that, in most reactions, the reactants do not
actually break down into their elements and then react to form products.
Since there is extensive data about enthalpies of formation, however;
it is useful to calculate the overall
enthalpy change this way: Moreover;
according to Hess's law, the enthalpy change is the same, regardless of
the pathway. (In Chapter 6, you will learn more about the mechanisms
by which compounds and elements react to form different elements and
compounds ) Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to use

says that energy efficiency is the ability to produce a desired effect with
minimum energy expenditure. For example, suppose that you want to
bake a
potato. You can use a microwave oven O a conventional oven_
Both
options achieve the same effect (baking the potato), but the first
uses less energy. According to the general definition above, using
the microwave oven is more
energy-efficient than
the conventional
oven_
The general definition is useful, but it is not quantitative.
Another definition of efficiency suggests that it is the ratio of useful
energy produced to energy used in its production, expressed as @ percent
This definition quantitatively compares input and output of energy When

Efficiency and Natural Gas
When discussing the efficiency of a fuel such as natural gas, you need to
specify how that fuel is being used. Consider; for example, natural gas.
Natural gas is primarily methane. Therefore, you can estimate an ideal
value for energy production using the enthalpy of combustion of methane.

In other words, 16 g of methane produces 802 k] of heat (under constant
pressure conditions).
When natural gas is used directly in cooking devices, its efficiency can
be as high as 90%. Thus, for every 16 g of gas burned, you

fuel efficiency than you can get with
appliances that use electrical energy

If natural gas is used to produce electricity in a power plant, however;
the efficiency is much
~~around 37% .
Why? The heat from the
burning natural gas is used to boil water: The kinetic energy of the result-
steam is transformed to mechanical energy for turning a turbine.
The turbine generates the electrical energy. Each of these steps has an
associated efficiency that is less than 100%. Thus, at each
the overall
efficiency of the fuel decreases.
Thinking About the Environment
Efficiency is not the only criterion for selecting an energy source. Since
the 1970s, society has become increasingly conscious of the impact of
energy technologies on the environment
Suppose that you want to analyze the environmental impact of an
energy source_
You can ask the
following questions:
Are any waste products or by-products of the energy production
process harmful to the environment? For example, any process in which
a
hydrocarbon is burned produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a
known greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming;
com-
bustion process provides the heat required to form oxides of nitrogen
from nitrogen gas. Nitrogen oxides contribute to acid precipitation.

Emerging Energy Sources
In the ThoughtLab on page 258, you probably noticed that all energy
sources have drawbacks as well as benefits. Scientists and engineers are
striving to find and develop new and better energy sources_
One energy
source that
engineers are trying to harness is nuclear fusion:
As you
learned in section 5.1, nuclear fusion provides a
deal of energy from
readily available fuel (isotopes of hydrogen). In addition, nuclear fusion
produces
a more
benign waste product than nuclear fission (helium).
Unfortunately, fusion is not
practical and controllable on a large scale
because of the enormous temperatures involved:
Chemists are also
striving to find new sources for existing fuels that
work well. The Chemistry Bulletin on the
page discusses & new
potential source of methane.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned about efficiency. You learned how it can
be defined in different ways for different purposes.
You used your
understanding of processes that produce energy to investigate the
efficiency and environmental impact of different energy sources.
In Chapter 5 , you learned about the energy that is associated with
chemical reactions. You used a calorimeter to measure heat
changes, and
you used these heat changes to write thermochemical equations. You
probably already realize that adding heat to reactants often speeds up a
reaction. In other words, raising the temperature of a system consisting of
a
chemical reaction often increases the
of the reaction.
A familiar
example is cooking: You increase the temperature of a heating element
to speed up the reactions that are taking place in the food as it cooks.
How does increasing temperature speed up a reaction? Is the enthalpy
of a reaction related to its
speed? Chapter 6 addresses these questions.

There are two other ways to represent the rate of this reaction:
in terms of the rate of the disappearance of dinitrogen pentoxide
in terms of the production of nitrogen dioxide
For every 1 mol of 02 that is produced, 4 mol of NOz are also
produced.
This means that the rate of
production of NOz is four times greater than
the rate of production of O2: Therefore, the rate of production of O2 is one
quarter the rate of production of NOz. You can express the relationship
between 02 production and NOz production as follows.

First check that the chemical equation is balanced. Then use the molar

Methods for Measuring Reaction Rates
How do chemists collect the data
need to determine a reaction rate?
To determine empirically the rate of a chemical reaction, chemists must
monitor the concentration or amount of at least one reactant Or
product.
There are
a
variety of techniques available. The choice of technique
depends on the reaction under study and the equipment available.
Monitoring Mass,
and Conductivity
Consider the reaction of magnesium with hydrochloric acid:
8.4pH
+
2HCl(aq)
MgClz(aq)
1
Hydrogen gas is released in the reaction. You can track the decrease in
mass, due to the escaping hydrogen, by carrying out the reaction in an
open vessel on an electric balance.
The decrease in mass can be plotted
against time. Some electronic balances can be connected to a computer;
with the appropriate software, to record mass and time data automatically
as the reaction
proceeds.

and chloride, Cl-. The MgClz that is produced exists as
three separate ions in solution: one Mg2+ ion and two Cl
ions. Since there
is an increase in the concentration f ions as the reaction proceeds, the
conductivity of the solution also increases with time
Monitoring Pressure
When a reaction involves gases, the pressure of the system often changes
as the reaction progresses. Chemists can monitor this pressure change. For
example, consider the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide, shown in
the following chemical reaction.
2NzOslg)
+
When 2 mol of NzOs gas decompose,
form 5 mol of gaseous products.
Therefore, the pressure of the system increases as the reaction proceeds,
provided that the reaction is carried out in a closed container: Chemists
use a
pressure sensor to monitor pressure changes.
Monitoring Colour
Colour change can also be used to monitor the progress of a reaction.
The absorption of light by a chemical compound is directly related to the
concentration of the compound For example, suppose you add several
drops of blue food colouring to a litre of water: If you add a few millilitres
of bleach to the solution, the intensity of the colour of the food dye
diminishes as it reacts.
You can then monitor the colour
change. (Do not
try this experiment without your teacher's supervision.)
For accurate measurements of the colour intensity of a solution,
chemists use
a
device called a
spectrophotometer: (See Figure 6.4.)
Figure 6.4
This photograph
shows a simple spectrophotometer;
which measures the amount of
visible light that is absorbed by
a
coloured solution: More
sophisti-
cated devices can measure the
absorption of ultraviolet and
infrared radiation.
Monitoring Volume
When a reaction generates gas, chemists can monitor the volume of gas
produced. In Investigation 6-A, you will determine average reaction rates

Factors That Affect Reaction Rate

reaction rate.
You may already be familiar with some of these observa-
tions, from your previous studies of chemical reactions and from
Investigation 6-A,
Summary of Some Factors That Affect Reaction Rate
1. The rate of a reaction can be increased by increasing the
temperature.
2
Increasing the concentrations of the reactants usually increases
the rate of the reaction.
3.
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction.
The catalyst is regenerated at the end of the reaction and can be
re-used.
You will learn more about catalysts in section 6.4.
4
Increasing the available surface area of a reactant increases the rate
of a reaction.
5.
The rate of a chemical reaction depends on what the reactants are_
Chemists and
engineers
use these and other factors to
manipulate the
rate of a
particular reaction to suit their needs For example, consider the
synthesis of ammonia, NHz, from nitrogen and hydrogen.
+
This reaction must be carried out with high concentrations of reactants, at
a
temperature of 400'C to 500 C, in the presence of a catalyst: Otherwise,
the rate of production of ammonia is too slow to be economically feasible:

The values of the exponents in the rate law equation establish the
order of the reaction. If a given reactant is found to have an exponent of 1,
the reaction is said to be first order in this reactant. Similarly, if the
exponent of a reactant is 2, the reaction is second order in this reactant.
The sum of the exponents (m + n) is known as the overall reaction order:
For
example, the rate law equation below represents a reaction that is first
order in A, second order in B, and third order (1
+ 2) overall:
Rate =
k[A]I[B]2
Chemists carry out experiments to determine the rate law equation for a
given reaction at a given temperature. Later in the section, you will work
with data and do this yourself First; however; it is necessary to examine
further the rate constant and reaction order:
The Rate Constant
The
magnitude of the rate constant, k; indicates the
of a reaction_
A small rate constant indicates & slow reaction: A
rate constant
indicates a fast reaction. For
example,
a first-order reaction with a rate
constant of 102
will be essentially
complete in less than 0.10 s. By
contrast; a first-order reaction with a rate constant of 10-3
will take
about 2 h:
As a reaction
proceeds, the reaction rate decreases because the
concentrations of the reactants decrease_
The value of the rate constant,
however; remains the same throughout the reaction. In other words, for a
given reaction under constant conditions, the value of k remains constant:
What happens if the temperature changes? Since the rate of a
chemical reaction depends on temperature, s0 does k Because a chemical
reaction depends o temperature, chemists who study reaction rates
must work at constant temperature. Furthermore, the value of k must
be accompanied by the temperature at which the reaction occurred
For
example, for the second order decomposition of hydrogen iodide;
k =2.7 X

written as follows:

The overall reaction order is 1 (1 + 0).

represented by the following equation.

Other Reactions
There are also other types of reactions, besides first-order and second-
order reactions. For
example, consider the decomposition of ammonia on
a
tungsten, W, catalyst.
2NHstg)

The rate law equation for this reaction has been found experimentally:
Rate

k[NH3]o = k
The rate of decomposition of ammonia on a tungsten catalyst is
independent of the concentration of ammonia, since [NH:]o = 1.
In other words, the rate of the reaction is a constant.
Many reactions have overall orders that are higher than 2_
Some
reactions have overall orders that are fractions. In this text, however;
you will concentrate on first-order and second-order reactions.
The Initial Rates Method
As you have learned, the values of the exponents in a rate law equation
must be determined experimentally. Chemists determine the values of
m and n by carrying out a series of
experiments. Each experiment has a
different, known set of initial concentrations.
All other factors, such as
temperature, remain constant: Chemists measure and compare the initial
rate of each reaction. Thus, this method is called the initial rates method.

Rate Experiments
To see how the initial rates method works , consider the
following reaction:
+
The general rate law equation for this reaction is
below.
Rate = k[NzOs]m
To determine the value of m, a chemist performs three experiments. A
different initial concentration of dinitrogen pentoxide, [NzOslo, is used for
each experiment; The subscript 0 represents t = 0.
Table 6.2 shows the
results of these experiments.

The value of m can be determined
at least two different methods. By
inspection, you can see that when the concentration of NzOs is doubled
(experiments 1 and 2), the rate also doubles.
When the concentration of
NzOs is tripled (experiments
1
and 3), the rate also triples This indicates
a
first-order relationship, as follows:
Rate =
k[NzOs]1
Alternatively, you can compare the rate law equation for each experiment
using ratios. This method is useful when the relationship between
concentration and rate is not

Therefore, the rate law equation is written as follows:
Rate
=
k[C1O2]2 [OH]
The reaction is second order in ClOz, first order in OH-
and third
order overall.
Step 2
To find the value of the rate constant, substitute data from any of
the three experiments into the rate law equation. Using the data
from experiment 1 gives the following equation:
1.30 X 10-3mol/(L_
s) = k(0.0150 mol/L)2(0.0250 mol/L)
Solve for k
1.30 X
mol/(L . s)
k
(0.0150 mol/L)? (0.0250 mol/L)
=
231 L2 /(mol2 _
s)
Therefore, the rate constant at the temperature of the
experiment is 231 L?/(mol? _
s). The rate law equation is
Rate = 231 L2/(mol2 _
s)[CIO2]2[OH-].
Check Your Solution
To check your values of m and n, solve by inspection.
When [C1Oz] is
constant and [OH-] doubles, the rate also doubles and the reaction is first
order in OH . When [OH-] is constant and [C1O2] triples, the rate
increases by a factor of 9. Recall that 32 = 9, indicating a second-order
relationship. To check your value of k, substitute data from experiment

The Half-Life of a Reaction
You have seen that a
large rate constant indicates a fast reaction, while
a
small rate constant indicates a slow reaction. It is not always easy,
however; to determine how
a reaction will take to be
completed
just by looking at the value of k How can you relate the
of a
reaction to the units of
for a first-order reaction?
The half-life, t1/2 , of a reaction is the time that is needed for the
reactant mass Or concentration to decrease by one half of its initial
value. The SI units for half-life are seconds. Usually, however; half-life
is expressed in whatever units of time are appropriate to the reaction:
For
example, the half-life of a very fast reaction may be measured in
microseconds. The half-life of a slow reaction may be measured in
Knowing the half-life of a reaction is an easy way to tell how fast o how
slow a reaction is.
Examine Figure 6.6 to see how half-life and reactant concentration are
related for the first-order decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide.

Transition State Theory
Transition state theory is
to explain what happens when molecules
collide in & reaction. It examines the transition, Or change, from reactants
to
products The kinetic energy of the reactants is transferred to potential
energy as the reactants collide, due to the law of conservation of energy.
This is analogous to a bouncing basketball, The kinetic energy of the ball
is converted to potential energy, which is stored in the deformed ball as it
hits the floor: The potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the
ball bounces away:
You can
represent the increase in potential energy during & chemical
reaction using a potential energy diagram: a diagram that charts the
potential energy of a reaction against the progress of the reaction.
Examples of potential energy diagrams are shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.13

Proposing and Evaluating Mechanisms
You can take apart a grandfather clock to take a look at its mechanism.
You can physically examine and take apart its gears and springs to deter-
mine how it works.
When chemists investigate the mechanism of a reaction,
are
not s0 lucky: Determining the mechanism of a chemical reaction is a bit
like figuring out how a clock works just by looking at its face and hands.
For this reason, reaction mechanisms are
proposed rather than definitively
stated. Much of the experimental evidence that is obtained to support
a mechanism is indirect. Researchers need a lot of creativity as
propose and test mechanisms.
One of the ways that researchers provide evidence for proposed
mechanisms is by proving the existence of a reaction intermediate.
Although a reaction intermediate usually appears for a very short time
and cannot be isolated, there are other ways to show its presence. For
example, if a reaction intermediate is coloured while other reactants are
colourless, a
spectrophotometer will show when the reaction intermediate
is formed: You may even be able to see a
fleeting colour change without
a
spectrophotometer:

When chemists propose a mechanism,
must satisfy the
following criteria:
The equations for the elementary steps must combine to give the
equation for the overall reaction.
The
proposed elementary steps must be reasonable.
The mechanism must support the experimentally determined rate law
The Rate-Determining Step
How do chemists determine whether a proposed mechanism supports the
experimentally determined rate law?
must consider how the rates of
the elementary reactions relate to the rate of the overall reaction.
Elementary reactions in mechanisms all have different rates. Usually one
elementary reaction, called the rate-determining step, is much slower:
Hence , it determines the overall rate
To understand the
rate-determining step, consider a two-step process.
Suppose that you and a friend are making buttered toast for a large group
of people.
The first
is toasting the bread. The second step is buttering
the toast: Suppose that toasting two slices of bread takes about two
minutes, but buttering the toast takes only a few seconds.
The rate at which the toast is buttered does not have any effect on
the overall rate of making buttered toast, because it is much faster than
the rate at which the bread is toasted. The overall rate of making buttered
toast, therefore, depends only on the rate of toasting the bread. In other
words, two pieces of buttered toast will be ready every two minutes.
This
is the same as the rate for the first step in the "buttered toast mechanism_
Thus, toasting the bread is the rate-determining
in the mechanism.

Now suppose that the butter is frozen nearly solid. It takes you about five
minutes to scrape off enough butter for one piece of toast. Pieces of toast
up, waiting to be buttered. In this case, the rate of making buttered
toast depends on the rate of spreading the butter: The rate of toasting is
fast relative to the rate of buttering:

Catalysts
A
catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction
without being consumed by the reaction. Catalysts are of tremendous
importance in all facets of chemistry, from the laboratory to industry:
Many industrial reactions, for example, would not be economically viable
without catalysts.
Well over three million tonnes of catalysts are
produced
annually in North America:
How a Catalyst Works
A
catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction s0 that a
larger fraction of the reactants have sufficient energy to react It lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternative mechanism for the reaction.
The
potential energy diagram in Figure 6.18 shows the activation energy
for an uncatalyzed reaction and the activation energy for the same
reaction with the addition of a catalyst:

product in step 2. Although the catalyst changes during the overall
reaction, it is regenerated unchanged at the end of the overall reaction.
Figure 6.19 shows the reaction of sodium potassium tartrate with
HzOz, catalyzed by cobaltous chloride, CoClz_
The CoClz is pink in solu-
tion. Notice that the contents of the beaker briefly change colour to dark
green, suggesting the formation of a reaction intermediate.
Also notice that
you can see the regeneration of the catalyst when the reaction is over:
Catalysts are divided into two categories, depending on whether Or not
are in the same
as the reactants.
Homogeneous Catalysts
A
homogeneous catalyst exists in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous catalysts most often catalyze gaseous and aqueous
reactions.
For
example, aqueous zinc chloride, ZnClz, is used to catalyze
the
following reaction.
(CH:)zCHOHlaq) +
(CH3)zCHClaq)
+
HzOte)
The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, and the catalyst is soluble in
water: Therefore, ZnClz is a homogeneous catalyst when it is used with
this reaction.
Heterogeneous Catalysts
heterogeneous catalyst exists in a
that is different from the
of the reaction it catalyzes. An important industrial use of heterogeneous
catalysts is the addition of hydrogen to an organic compound that
contains C ==C double bonds. This process is called hydrogenation.
Consider the hydrogenation of ethylene, shown below.

Without a catalyst, the reaction is very slow. When the reaction is catalyzed

In the ground-breaking scientific paper that
presented their work, Menten and Michaelis also

formula describes the rate at which enzymes break
down their substrates. It correlates the speed of
the enzyme reaction with the concentrations of
the enzyme and the substrate. Called the Michaelis-

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that chemical reactions usually proceed as a
series of steps called elementary reactions You related the equations for
elementary reactions to rate laws.
You learned how the relative

MO Historians suspect that many ancient Romans suffered from lead
poisoning: The ancient Romans used lead for their plumbing system
(hence, the Latin name for the element). Lead is a poison because it
can form strong bonds with proteins, including enzymes. Lead and
other heavy metals react with enzymes by binding to functional groups
on their active sites.
When lead binds to a protein, such as an enzyme,
the protein often precipitates out of solution.

understanding of enzymes and the information above,

of enzymes makes lead toxic to humans.

puddle of water remains after a summer shower: The puddle evapo-
rates because some of the water molecules near the surface have enough
kinetic energy to escape from the liquid. At the same time, some water
molecules in the air may condense back into the liquid. The chance
of this happening is small, however: The puddle soon evaporates
completely, as shown in Figure 7.1(A).
Even if you put a lid on a jar of water; some of the water in the jar
evaporates. Careful measurements show that the level of liquid water
in the jar initially decreases because more water evaporates than
condenses. As the number of water vapour molecules increases,
however, some condense back into the liquid. Eventually, the number
of evaporating molecules and the number of condensing molecules
are
equal The level of water inside the jar remains constant: At this

Conditions That Apply to All Equilibrium Systems
The fundamental requirement for equilibrium is that opposing changes
must occur at the same rate. There are
processes that reach
equilibrium.
Three physical processes that reach equilibrium are

What is it that equilibrium systems like these have in common? What con-
ditions are necessary for equilibrium to become established? As outlined
in the box below; there are four conditions that apply to all equilibrium
systems.

2
The observable (macroscopic) properties of a system at equilibrium
are constant. At
equilibrium, there is no overall change in the
properties that depend on the total quantity of matter in the
system. Examples of these properties include colour; pressure,
concentration, and pH:
You can summarize the first two
equilibrium conditions by stating that
equilibrium involves dynamic change at the molecular level but no change
at the macroscopic level.
3.
Equilibrium can only be reached in a closed system.
A closed system
is a
system that does not allow the input Or escape of any component
of the equilibrium system, including energy: For this reason, &

From left to right; the reaction is exothermic Therefore, the

change, AH, is negative. If the enthalpy change was the only condition
that determined whether a reaction is favourable, then the synthesis
reaction would take place. The synthesis reaction does take place-_but
only at relatively moderate temperatures. Above 400*C, the reverse
reaction is favourable.
The decomposition of HgO(s) occurs. Thus, the
direction in which this reaction proceeds depends on temperature.
This is fundamentally different from the dependence of reaction rate
on temperature that you learned about in Unit 3.
The reaction between
and HgO(s) does not just change its rate with a change in
temperature, it changes its direction.

If the gas is ideal, this favourable change involves no change in energy: Why
must the gas be ideal?
The process shown in Figure 7.5 is certainly a favourable change.
Yet no
exchange of energy is involved  The condition that influences this change
is called entropy. It is an important condition in all physical and chemical
changes.
Entropy and Favourable Changes
Entropy, S, is the tendency toward randomness O disorder in a system.
It is als0 a thermodynamic property that can be measured. It can be used
to describe qualitative changes in energy
An ordered arrangement of particles (atoms, ions, Or molecules) has
entropy (smaller disorder) than the same number of particles in
random arrangements. Thus, the entropy of a pure substance depends on
its state.
The entropy of a system increases (becomes more disordered)
with temperature, because the motion of particles becomes more chaotic
at higher temperatures. See Figure 7.6 on the next page.

How, then, did the entropy of the universe increase?
The answer to this question involves changes to the surroundings
Each of you, on your way to class, metabolized energy The movement
and heat from your bodies added to the entropy of the air particles around
you. In fact, the increase in the entropy of the surroundings was greater
than the decrease in the entropy of the system. Therefore, the total
entropy of the universe increased:
What does entropy have to do with favourable chemical changes and
equilibrium systems? All favourable changes involve an increase in the
total amount of entropy. Recall the endothermic reaction in Figure 7.4.

Now recall the reaction between mercury and oxygen. It favours
the formation of HgO below about 400C, but the decomposition of HgO
above 400*C. This reaction highlights the importance of temperature to
favourable change. Enthalpy, entropy, and temperature are linked in a
concept called free energy

This engine would still be unable to convert all the energy

energy of the hot exhaust, is used to increase the entropy of the surround-

follows:
When AG is negative, the forward reaction is favourable.
When AG is zero, the reaction is at

When AG is positive, the reaction is favourable in the reverse direction

Table 7.1 shows how you can use the signs of AH and 4S to determine
whether a chemical reaction is favourable. It also shows how AH and AS

be fast or slow.
Thermodynamics makes no prediction about the rate of a

Dinitrogen tetroxide gas is produced by vaporizing dinitrogen

The Equilibrium Constant
From other
experiments involving the reaction between nitrogen
tetroxide and nitrogen dioxide, chemists know that both the forward
and reverse reactions involve elementary steps. Thus, you can write rate
equations for the reactions.
Forward reaction:
Reverse reaction:
Forward rate:
k;[N2O4]
Reverse rate:
k;[NOz]2
At
equilibrium,
Foward rate = Reverse rate
k;[NzO4] = k[NOz]2
The ratio of rate constants is another constant. The forward rate constant;
kf, divided by the reverse rate constant, k;, is called the equilibrium
constant,

at
equilibrium, the value of the equilibrium constant depends only on
temperature. Changing the temperature of a reacting mixture changes the
rate of the forward and reverse reactions by different amounts, because
the forward and reverse reactions have different activation energies
A
reacting mixture at one temperature has an equilibrium constant whose
value changes if the mixture is allowed to reach equilibrium at a different
temperature.
The numerical value of the equilibrium constant does not depend
on whether the

particular chemicals in the

however; that Kc is calculated using concentration values when the

This value indicates the extent of the reaction. It is linked to the size of
Kc. As you know, the equilibrium expression is always written with the
product terms over the reactant terms. Therefore, a large Kc means that the
concentration of products is larger than the concentration of reactants at
equilibrium. When referring to a reaction with a large Kc, chemists often
say that the position of equilibrium lies to the right; O that it favours the
products. Similarly, if Kc is small, the concentration of reactants is larger
than the concentration of products Chemists say that the position of
equilibrium lies to the left, o that it favours reactants Thus, the
following general statements are true:
When K > 1,
products are favoured. The equilibrium lies far to the right.
Reactions where K is greater than
are
usually regarded as going to
completion.
When K ~ 1, there are
approximately equal concentrations of reactants
and
products at equilibrium.
When K
1, reactants are favoured. The
equilibrium lies far to the left:
Reactions in which K is smaller than 10-10 are usually
regarded
as not
taking place at all.
Notice that the subscript "c" has been left off K in these general state-
ments. This reflects the fact that there are other equilibrium constants

concentrations. You will learn about other types of equilibrium constants

In the Sample Problem and Practice Problems below, you will

in mind
that the size of Kc is not related to the time that a reaction takes to achieve
equilibrium: Very large values of Kc may be associated with reactions
that take place extremely slowly. The time that a reaction takes to reach
equilibrium depends on the rate of the reaction.
This is determined by
the size of the activation energy.

The Meaning of a Small Equilibrium Constant
Understanding the meaning of a small equilibrium constant can
sometimes help to simplify a calculation that
otherwise involve
a
quadratic equation.
When Kc is small compared with the initial concen-
tration, the value of the initial concentration minus x is approximately
equal to the initial concentration. Thus, you can ignore x Of course, if the
initial concentration of a substance is zero, any
equilibrium concentration
of the substance, no matter how small, is significant: In general, values
of Kc are not measured with accuracy better than 5%. Therefore,
making
the approximation is justified if the calculation error you introduce is
less than 5% _
To help you decide whether o not the approximation is justified,
divide the initial concentration by the value of Kc. If the answer is greater
than 500, the approximation is justified. If the answer is between 100 and
500, it may be justified If the answer is less than 100, it is not justified.
The
equilibrium expression must be solved in full,

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that the equilibrium constant, Kc
is a ratio
of product concentrations to reactant concentrations.
You used concentra-
tions to find K, and you used K to find concentrations.
You also used an
ICE table to track and summarize the initial,
change, and equilibrium
quantities in a reaction.
You found that the value of Kc is small for reac-
tions that reach equilibrium with a high concentration of reactants, and
the value of Kc is large for reactions that reach equilibrium with a low
concentration of reactants. In the next section, you will learn how to
determine whether Or not a reaction is at equilibrium, and, if it is not,
in which direction it will go to achieve equilibrium.

trations of gases are present in a container at 500*C: [Nz(g)] = 0.10 mol/L,
[H2(g)]
= 0.30 mol/L, and [NHz(g)] = 0.20 mol/L. Is this mixture of gases
at
equilibrium? If not, in which direction will the reaction go to reach
equilibrium?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate Qc and interpret its value.
What Is Given?
You have the balanced chemical equation. You know that the value of Kc
is 0.40. You also know the concentrations of the gases: [Nz] = 0.10 mol/L,
[Hz] = 0.30 mol/L, and [NHs] = 0.20 mol/L
Plan Your Strategy
Write the expression for Qc, and then calculate its value. Compare
the value of Qc with the value of Kc: Decide whether the system is at
equilibrium and, ifnot, in which direction the reaction will go.

Check Your Solution
Check your calculation of Qc: (Errors in evaluating fractions with
exponents are common.) The value of Kc is less than one, s0 you would
expect the numerator to be less than the denominator: This is difficult to
evaluate without a calculator; however; because of the powers.

Le Chatelier's Principle
What happens to a system at equilibrium if the concentration of one of the
reacting chemicals is changed? This question has practical importance,
because many manufacturing processes are continual. Products are
removed and more reactants are added without stopping the process. For
example, consider the Haber process that
was mentioned in the
previous

can check this by calculating Qc and making sure that it is equal to Kc:)
Ammonia can be removed from the
equilibrium mixture by cooling
because ammonia liquefies at a higher temperature than either nitrogen
or
hydrogen. What happens to an equilibrium mixture if some ammonia
is removed? To find out, you need to calculate Qc -
[NH:l?
[Nz] [Hz]8
If ammonia is removed from the equilibrium mixture, the numerator will
decrease, s0 Qc will be smaller than Kc
When Qc < Kc, the system attains
equilibrium by moving to the right Why? The system must respond to
the removal of ammonia by forming more ammonia. Similarly, if nitrogen,
hydrogen, or both
were added, the system would re-establish equilibrium
by shifting to the right: As
as the temperature remains constant,
the re-established equilibrium will have the same Kc as the original
equilibrium.
A French chemist, Henri Le Chatelier, experimented with various
chemical equilibrium systems. (See Figure 7.9.) In 1888, Le Chatelier
summarized his work on changes to equilibrium systems in & general
statement called Le Chatelier's principle. It may be stated as follows:
A
dynamic equilibrium tends to respond s0 as to relieve the effect of any
change in the conditions that affect the equilibrium.
Le Chatelier's principle predicts the way that an equilibrium system
responds to change. For example, when the concentration of a substance
in a reaction mixture is changed, Le Chatelier's principle qualitatively
predicts what you can show quantitatively by evaluating the reaction quo-
tient: If products are removed from an equilibrium system, more products
must be formed to relieve the change. This is just as you would predict,
because Qc will be less than Kc -
Le Chatelier's principle also
predicts what will happen when other
changes are made to an equilibrium system. For example, you can
use Le
Chatelier's principle to predict the effects of changing the volume of a
cylinder that contains a mixture of gases, or the effects of changing the

The Effect of lons on Aqueous Equilibrium Systems
Many important equilibrium systems involve ions in aqueous solution.
The common ion effect
Le Chatelier's principle to ions in aqueous
solution.
As its name suggests, the common ion effect involves adding
an ion to a solution in which the ion is already present in solution. It is
a concentration effect: The
equilibrium shifts away from the added
ion, a8
predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.
An aqueous solution that contains certain ions can be added to
another solution to form & precipitate, if the ions have low solubility:
For example, adding silver nitrate solution to test for Cl-(aq) is effective
due to the very low solubility of silver chloride: You can use the precipi-
tation of an insoluble salt to remove almost all of a particular ion from
a
solution and, a8 a result, cause a shift in the
position of equilibrium
of the original solution: The common ion effect is important in the
solubility of salts. The precipitation of insoluble salts is used to identify
the presence of unknown ions. You will learn more about the common
ion effect in Chapter 9.
The Effect of Temperature Changes on the Position of Equilibrium
As you know, the value of the equilibrium constant changes with tempera-
ture, because the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are affected.
Le Chatelier's principle still holds, however: It can be used to
predict the
effect of temperature changes on a system when the
of the enthalpy
change for the reaction is known: For example, the dissociation of sulfur
trioxide is endothermic.
+
AH = 197 kJ
As the reaction proceeds from left to right, energy is absorbed by the
chemical system and converted to chemical potential energy: If an
equilibrium mixture of these gases is heated, energy is added to the
system. Le Chatelier's principle predicts a shift that will relieve the
imposed change. Therefore, the shift will tend to remove the added
energy: This will happen if the equilibrium shifts to the right, increasing
the amount of

As a result, the value of Kc will

The Effects of Volume and Pressure Changes on Equilibrium
When the volume of a mixture of gases decreases, the pressure of the
gases must increase. Le Chatelier's principle predicts a shift in
brium to relieve this change. Therefore, the shift must tend to reduce the
pressure of the gases. Molecules striking the walls of a container cause
gas pressure, s0 a reduction in gas pressure at constant temperature must
mean fewer gas molecules. Consider the
following reaction
+
There are two gas molecules on the left side of the equation.
+
There are three gas molecules on the right side. Consequently,
if the equilibrium shifts to the left; the pressure of the mix-
ture will decrease. Reducing the volume of an equilibrium

The overall effect is to lower the activation energy, which increases the
rate of reaction.
The activation energy is lowered the same amount for
the forward and reverse reactions, however: There is the same increase
in reaction rates for both reactions.
As a result, a catalyst does not affect
the position of equilibrium. It only affects the time that is taken to achieve
equilibrium.

Plan Your Strategy
Identify the change. Then use the chemical equation to determine the
shift in equilibrium that will minimize the change.
Act on Your Strategy
(a) [PCIs] increases. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift to minimize
[PCls]. The reaction shifts to the right:
(b) [Clz] is reduced. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift to increase
[Cl2] .
The reaction shifts to the right:
(c) The temperature decreases. Therefore, the equilibrium must shift in
the direction in which the reaction is exothermic From left to right,
the reaction is endothermic. Thus, the reaction must be exothermic
from right to left: The reaction shifts to the left if the temperature is

Applying Le Chatelier's Principle: Manufacturing Ammonia
Industrial processes must be run at optimal conditions to be economic
This means more than simply manipulating the reaction conditions to
maximize the extent of the reaction. Business people, and the profession-
als
hire to advise them, must consider other factors as well. These
factors include the rate of the reaction, safety, the location of the plant, the
cost to build and operate the plant; the cost of acquiring reactant materi-
als, the cost of transporting products, and the cost of hiring, educating,
and
maintaining plant workers
The chapter introduction mentioned the importance of nitrogen to
plants and animals. Despite nitrogen's abundance in the atmosphere, its
low reactivity means that there is a limited supply in a form that organ-
isms can use. In nature, bacteria and the energy of lightning supply the
nitrates and other nitrogen compounds that plants need to survive.
Humans use
technology to produce these compounds for our extensive
agricultural industry
In this chapter; you learned about the Haber process for manufactur-
ammonia:
You used this process to help you understand various
concepts related to equilibrium;
As you can see in Figure 7.11, ammonia
is a valuable industrial chemical. Its annual global production is well over
100 million tonnes The vast majority of ammonia, roughly 80%, is used
to make fertilizers_
You will now examine how the
equilibrium concepts
you have been studying work together to provide society with a reliable,
cost-effective supply of ammonia.
Before World War I, the main source of nitrates for human use was
from
deposits of bird droppings in Peru and sodium nitrate from

Chile. These sources were
becoming scarce and expensive. Then Fritz

Because the reaction is exothermic, heat is released as the reaction
proceeds. Le Chateliers principle predicts that the yield of ammonia
is greater at lower temperatures. Just as in the contact process for manu-
facturing sulfuric acid, however; high yield is not the only important
factor;
The rate of reaction for ammonia
synthesis is too slow at low
temperatures.
Le Chateliers principle also predicts that the yield of ammonia is
greater at higher pressures. High-pressure plants are expensive to build
and maintain, however: In fact, the first industrial plant that manufactured
ammonia had its reaction vessel blow up. A German chemical engineer;
Carl Bosch, solved this problem by designing a double-walled steel vessel
that could operate at several hundred times atmospheric pressure. Modern
plants operate at pressures in the range of 20 200 kPa to 30 400 kPa:
The gas mixture is kept pressurized in a condenser: (See Figure 7.12.)
Ammonia is removed from the reaction vessel by
cooling the gas mixture.
Because of the hydrogen bonding between ammonia molecules, the gas
condenses into a liquid while the nitrogen and hydrogen remain as gases.
Nitrogen is removed to shift the equilibrium toward the production of
more ammonia.
Once the ammonia is removed, the gases are
recycled
back to the reaction vessel in a continuous
operation.

The Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases
According to the Arrhenius theory (1887), acids and bases are defined
in terms of their structure and the ions produced when

in water:
An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form Ht(aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius acids are hydrochloric acid, HCL, and sulfuric
acid, H2SO4-
A base is a substance that dissociates in water to form OH-(aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius bases are sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and
potassium hydroxide, KOH:

The Arrhenius theory explains acid-base reactions as a combination of
Htiaq) and OH (aq) . It
provides insight into the heat of neutralization for
the reaction between a strong acid and
a
strong base. (Strong acids and
bases dissociate completely into ions in solution.) For example, consider
the
following reaction.

The total ionic equation for this reaction is

Subtracting spectator ions from both sides, the net ionic equation is
Httaq) + OH-(aq)

AH =-56 kJ
Different combinations of strong Arrhenius acids and bases react with the
same exothermic result: Measurements always show the release of 56 k]J of
energy per mole of water formed: This makes sense, because the net ionic
equation is the same regardless of the specific neutralization reaction that
occurs
The Arrhenius theory has limitations, however: For example, Htaq)

a

attracted to the region of negative charge on the lone

The hydronium ion, itself; forms hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules. (See Figure 8.1.) Thus, a better formula for the ion that is
present in acidic solutions is [H(HzO)nlt_
where n is usually 4 Or 5. For
convenience, however, chemists usually use a single hydronium ion

The Arrhenius theory also has limitations for explaining certain reactions.

The Bronsted-Lowry Theory
The limitations of the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases are overcome
by a more general theory, called the Bronsted-Lowry theory: This
was
proposed independently, in 1923, by Johannes Bronsted, a Danish
chemist, and Thomas Lowry, an English chemist. It recognizes an
acid-base reaction as a chemical
equilibrium, having both
a
forward
reaction and a reverse reaction that involve the transfer of a
proton. The
Bronsted-Lowry theory defines acids and bases as follows:
An acid is a substance from which a proton can be removed: (Some
chemists describe Bronsted-Lowry acids as
'proton-donors")
A base is a substance that can accept a proton. (Some chemists describe
Bronsted-Lowry bases as
'proton-acceptors.")
Note that the word
'proton"
refers to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom
an
H+ ion that has been removed from the acid molecule. It does not refer
to a
proton removed from the nucleus of another atom, such as oxygen Or
sulfur; that may be present in the acid molecule:
As mentioned previously,
Ht ions share electrons with any species (ion o molecule) that has a lone
of electrons. In aqueous solution, the proton bonds with a water
molecule to form the
hydronium ion_
Unlike the Arrhenius theory,
however; the Bronsted-Lowry theory is not restricted to aqueous solutions.
For
example, the lone
of electrons on an ammonia molecule can bond
with Ht
and liquid ammonia can act as a base.

Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
The dissociation of acetic acid in water is represented in Figure 8.2.
This dissociation is an equilibrium reaction because it proceeds in both
directions. Acetic acid is weak, s0 only a few ions dissociate. The
position
of
equilibrium lies to the left, and the reverse reaction is favoured: In
the reverse reaction, the hydronium ion gives up a proton to the acetate
ion. Thus, these ions are an acid and a base, respectively, as shown in
Figure 8.3. The acid on the left (CH:COOH) and the base on the right
(CH;COO ) differ by one proton: They are called a conjugate acid-base

Molecular Structure and the Strength of Acids and Bases
When a strong acid or base dissolves in water; almost every acid or base
molecule dissociates.
While there are many acids and bases, most are
weak. Thus, the number of strong acids and strong bases is fairly small.
Strong Acids
binary acids that have the general formula HX(aq)
where X = Cl,
Br; and I (but not F): for
example, hydrochloric acid, HCL, and
hydrobromic acid, HBr (HCl and HBr are hydrohalic acids: acids
that have hydrogen bonded to atoms of the halogen elements.)
oxoacids (acids containing oxygen atoms) in which the number of
oxygen atoms exceeds, by two Or more, the number of protons that
can be dissociated: for example, nitric acid, HNO3, sulfuric acid,
HzSO4, perchloric acid, HCIO4, and chloric acid, HClO:
The binary acids of non-metals exhibit periodic trends in their acid
strength, a8 shown in Figure 8.5.
Two factors are
responsible for this
trend: the electronegativity of the atom that is bonded to hydrogen,
and the strength of the bond.

Figure 8.5
The binary acids
show periodic trends, which are
related to electronegativity and
bond strength.
Across a
period, electronegativity is the most important factor:
The acid
strength of hydrides increases as their electronegativity increases. This
happens because an electronegative atom draws electrons away from the
hydrogen atom, making it relatively positive. The negative
of a water
molecule then strongly attracts the hydrogen atom and
it away:
Down a group, bond strength is the most important factor Acid
strength increases as bond strength decreases.
A
weaker bond means that
the
hydrogen atom is more easily
away from the atom to which it
is attached. For example, hydrofluoric acid is a stronger acid than water;
but HF is the weakest of the hydrohalic acids because the H-F bond is
relatively strong:

Sulfuric acid is a far stronger acid than the hydrogen sulfate ion, because
much more energy is
required to remove a proton from a negatively

hydrogen atoms that have dissociated increases.

acid into a beaker that contains 15.0 mL of 2.00 mol/L sodium
hydroxide solution. Is the resulting solution acidic o basic? What is the
concentration of the ion that causes the solution to be acidic or basic?

Section Summary
Strong acids and bases (and strong electrolytes) dissociate completely in
water: Therefore, you can
use the concentrations of these
compounds to
determine the concentrations of the ions
form in aqueous solutions.
You cannot, however; use the concentrations of weak acids, bases, and
electrolytes in the same way: Their solutions contain some particles
that have not dissociated into ions. Nevertheless, important changes in
[H:Ot] and [OH-] take place because dissolved ions affect the dissociation
of water:

The concentration of HsOt in the solution of a strong acid is equal
to the concentration of the dissolved acid, unless the solution is very
dilute. Consider [HzO+] in a solution of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid.
All the molecules of HCl dissociate in water, forming a hydronium ion
concentration that equals 0.1 mol/L. The increased [H3O+] pushes the
dissociation reaction between water molecules to the left; in accordance
with Le Chatelier's principle. Consequently, the concentration of hydro-
nium ions that results from the dissociation of water is even less than
1 X
mol/L. This [HsOt] is negligible compared with the 0.1 mol/L
concentration of the hydrochloric acid: Unless the solution is very dilute
(about 1 X

Similarly, the concentration of hydroxide ions can be determined from
the concentration of the dissolved base. If the solution is a strong base,
you can ignore the dissociation of water molecules when determining
[OH-], unless the solution is very dilute. When either [H:O+] or [OH-] is
known, you can use the ion product constant for water; Kw, to determine
the concentration of the other ion. Although the value of Kw for water is
1.0 X

pH and Ka of a Weak Acid
Table 8.2 lists the acid dissociation constants for selected acids at 25*C.
Notice that weak acids have Ka values that are between
1 and about
1 X
weak acids have Ka values that are less than 1 X
The smaller the value of Ka, the less the acid ionizes in aqueous solution.
Problems that involve the concentrations of ions formed in aqueous
solutions are considered to be
equilibrium problems. The steps for solving
acid and base equilibrium problems are similar to the steps you learned in
Chapter 7 for solving equilibrium problems.
Solving Equilibrium Problems That Involve Acids and Bases
The steps that you will use to solve acid and base equilibrium
lems will vary depending on the problem. Below are a few general
steps to guide you.
Write the chemical equation. Use the chemical equation to set up an
ICE table for the
reacting substances. Enter any values that are given
in the problem. (Note: For the problems in this textbook, you can
assume that the concentrations of hydronium ions and hydroxide
ions in pure water are negligible compared with the concentrations
of these ions when a weak acid or weak base is dissolved in water:)
Let X represent the change in concentration of the substance with
the smallest coefficient in the chemical equation.
For problems that give the initial concentration of the acid, [HA],
compare the initial concentration of the acid with the acid
dissociation constant, Ka
[HA]
If
500 , the

If

change in the initial concentration, x, may
not be

possibly requiring the solution of a quadratic equation.

Percent Dissociation
The percent dissociation of a weak acid is the fraction of acid molecules
that dissociate compared with the initial concentration of the acid,
expressed as a
percent: (Some chemists refer to percent dissociation
as
percent of dissociation.) The percent dissociation depends on the value
of Ka for the acid, as well as the initial concentration of the weak acid.
The following Sample Problems show how to solve problems that involve
percent dissociation.

[H3Ot] results from the first dissociation of phosphoric acid, s0 the
second dissociation has a negligible effect on the concentration of
hydronium ions or the pH of the solution.
You would expect this,
because the second dissociation is much weaker than the first.
Polyprotic Acids and [HzO+]
All polyprotic acids, except sulfuric acid, are weak. Their second
dissociation is much weaker than their first dissociation_
For this reason
when calculating [H3O+] and pH of a polyprotic acid, only the first
dissociation needs to be considered. The calculation is then the same as
the calculation for any weak monoprotic acid. In the Sample Problem_
[HPO42-] was found to be the same as the second dissociation constant,
Kaz
The concentration of the anions formed in the second dissociation
of a polyprotic acid is equal to Kaz'
The only common strong polyprotic acid is sulfuric acid.
Nevertheless, it is
only for the first dissociation. Like the second
dissociation of other polyprotic acids, the second dissociation of sulfuric
acid is weak:

The solution acts as a base with water:

Kw
Thus, for an acid and its conjugate base (or a base and its conjugate acid),
KaKb = Kw
One interpretation of the result is the stronger an acid, the
weaker its conjugate base must be_
This makes sense chemically, because
a
acid gives up a proton from each molecule. Therefore, its conju-
base does not bond with the proton: In summary, then, the strength
of an acid and its conjugate base are inversely related:
The conjugate of a
strong acid is always a weak base, and, conversely, the conjugate of a
strong base is always a weak acid.

Buffer Solutions
solution that contains a weak acid/conjugate base mixture o a weak

A buffer solution
resists changes in pH when a moderate amount of an acid Or a base is
added to it. (See Figure 8.9.) For
example, adding 10 mL of 1.0 mol/L
hydrochloric acid to 1 L of water
changes the pH from 7 to about 3, a
difference of 4 units.
Adding the same amount of acid to 1 L of buffered
solution might change the
by only 0.1 unit.

little effect because the added H3Ot or OH- ions are removed by one of

example, the conjugate base of hydrochloric acid, HCL, is Cl .
The
chloride ion is a very weak base, so it does not react significantly with
water: Therefore, the chloride ion, and the conjugate bases of other strong
acids, do not affect the pH of an aqueous solution.
Similarly, the cations that form strong bases (the alkali metals and
the metals below beryllium in Group 2 (IIA)) do not tend to react with
hydroxide ions. These cations are weaker acids than water: Therefore,
when
a

If a salt contains the cation of a strong base and the anion of a strong
acid, neither ion reacts with water; Therefore, the solution has a pH
of 7. Sodium chloride is an example of such a salt: It is formed by the
reaction of sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and hydrochloric acid
(a strong acid). Salts of strong bases and

Salts of Weak Bases and Weak Acids
If a salt consists of the cation of a weak base and the anion of a weak acid,
both ions react with water: The solution is weakly acidic o weakly basic,
depending on the relative strength of the ions that act as the acid
or the base.
You can determine which ion is stronger by comparing the
values of Ka and Kb associated with the cation and the anion, respectively.

Calculating pH at Equivalence
In an acid-base titration, you carefully measure the volumes of acid and
base that react: Then, knowing the concentration of either the acid OT
the base, and the stoichiometric relationship between them, you calculate
the concentration of the other reactant. The equivalence
in the
titration occurs when just enough acid and base have been mixed for a
complete reaction to OCCUT, with no excess of either reactant. As you
learned in Chapter 8, you can find the equivalence
from
a
that
shows pH versus volume of one solution added to the other solution. To
determine the equivalence
experimentally, you need to measure the
pH. Because pH meters are expensive, and the glass electrodes are fragile,
titrations are often
performed using an acid-base indicator:
An acid-base indicator is usually a weak, monoprotic organic acid.
The indicator is in equilibrium between the undissociated acid, which is
one colour; and its conjugate base, which is a different colour:

For
example,
one indicator; called methyl red, is red when the pH is
below 4.2, and yellow when the pH is above 6.2.
The
in a titration
at which an indicator
changes colour is called the end-point  The colour
change occurs over
a
range of about 2 pH units, but the pH of a solution
changes rapidly near the equivalence
Often a single drop of base
causes the shift from colour 1 to colour 2_
For methyl red, the end-point
occurs over the pH range 4.2
6.2. Therefore, this indicator is used when
an acid-base titration results in a moderately acidic solution at equiva-

change is favoured. The same three factors are important for determining
how much of a salt will dissolve in a certain volume of water: These
factors are combined in the
following equation, where AG is the change
in free energy of the system.
AG = AH
TAS
As you know from Chapter 7
a
change is favoured when AG is negative.
When a salt dissolves, the entropy of the system always increases,
because ions in solution are more disordered than ions in a solid crystal.
An increase in entropy favours the formation of a solution because the
term ~TAS is negative. Most solids dissolve to a greater extent at higher
solution temperatures, because the term ~TAS becomes more negative.
Explaining the overall enthalpy change for a dissolving salt is more
complicated because it involves a number of energy changes. Cations
must be separated from anions, which requires energy. Water molecules
then surround each ion in solution, which releases energy. If the overall
enthalpy change is negative, the formation of a solution is favoured. If the
enthalpy increases, the formation of a solution is not favoured because AG
is less negative:

equal to the rate of dissolving: As you know; when the forward rate and
the backward rate of a process are equal, the system is at

Because the reactants and the products are in different phases, the reaction
is said to have reached heterogeneous equilibrium. For solubility systems
of sparingly soluble ionic compounds, equilibrium exists between the solid

compound and its dissociated ions in solution.

As you learned in Chapter 8, this phenomenon is called the common

Adding
a common ion to a solution increases the concentration of that ion
in solution. As a result,
equilibrium shifts away from the ion. In this
example, adding chromate ions causes the equilibrium to shift to the left,
and lead(II) chromate precipitates.

Initially, all the magnesium sulfate dissolves. The solution is not at

The ion product expression for magnesium sulfate is written
as

You calculate Qsp by substituting the concentration of each ion into
the expression. If Qsp is larger than Ksp the product of the concentrations of
the ions is greater than it would be at equilibrium. For the system to attain
equilibrium, some of the ions must leave the solution by precipitation:
Conversely, if Qsp is less than Ksp' the product of the concentration of the
ions is smaller than it is at equilibrium: Therefore, the solution is not
saturated and more ions can be added to the solution without any
precipitation. The relationship between Qsp and Ksp for the dissociation of

guideline takes precedence. (For instance, guideline 3 says that carbonates
have very low solubility: Sodium carbonate is soluble, however; because
guideline
1 says that ionic

soluble.)
Chemists do not usually work with solubility products for soluble
compounds. Thus, you will not find soluble ionic compounds listed in Ksp
tables. If you see a
compound in a Kp table, you know that it has a low
solubility relative to compounds such as sodium chloride.

Analytical Applications of Precipitation Reactions
In the previous Sample Problems, you saw that combining solutions of
soluble ionic compounds can cause the precipitation of a slightly soluble
ionic
compound. Analytical chemists use precipitation reactions to
remove ions from solution Or to identify ions in an unknown solution.
Fractional Precipitation
Suppose a chemist has a solution that contains several similar ions. The
chemist wants to remove some of these ions, while leaving other ions in
solution. One way to do this is by fractional precipitation: a process in
which ions are
selectively precipitated from solution, leaving other ions
For
example, consider a solution that contains three halide ions: Cl ,
Br
and I-,
Since these halides all come from the same group on the
periodic table,
share
properties When
are the anions in
slightly soluble ionic compounds, however;
have different solubilities.
(See Table 9.4.) Therefore, chemists can use fractional precipitation to
separate them from solution.

Out of the three
compounds, silver chloride is the most soluble and
silver iodide is the least soluble. (You can compare the solubilities of
the compounds based on their solubility products because
are all
the same type. Each formula unit contains two ions.)
To separate the halide ions, a chemist adds silver ions to the solution
until most of the iodide ions precipitate out as Agl: The chemist stops
adding silver ions before AgBr begins to precipitate.
The chemist then
removes the solid Agl by filtration or by
a
centrifuge, as shown in
Figure 9.8. To remove the bromide ions, the chemist repeats the process
with the
remaining solution:
The chemist adds silver ions until most of
the bromide ions precipitate out as AgBr; but stops adding ions before
AgCl begins to precipitate. By filtering O centrifuging again, the chemist
obtains a solution that contains only chloride ions.
Figure 9.8
Chemists use a
centrifuge to separate a precipitate
from a solution: The centrifuge
spins the samples quickly, and the
resulting force pushes the precipi-
tate to the bottom of the test tube:
The solution can then be decanted:

An
Issue
to
Analyze
Earth in Equilibrium
Background
Scientists often think about Earth as
composed
of four main systems. The biosphere includes all
on Earth. The
geosphere includes
non-living
such as rocks and soil. The
hydrosphere includes all water, such as oceans,
rivers, and even
puddles. The atmosphere includes
gases, vapours, and aerosols. These four systems
overlap in many ways For example, animals are part
of the biosphere, but
interact with components
in the
geosphere (living in a burTow Or cave), the
hydrosphere (drinking and excreting water), and the
atmosphere (breathing).
Scientists have noticed various shifts in Earth's
equilibrium in recent years. Since Earth is in &
dynamic equilibrium, some shifts occur naturally
There is considerable evidence, however, that the
following shifts have been caused by, or at least
strongly influenced by; human activities. Some of
these shifts may be familiar to you, with names

Half-Reactions
To monitor the transfer of electrons in a redox reaction, you can
represent the oxidation and reduction separately
A
half-reaction is a
balanced equation that shows the number of electrons involved in either
oxidation or reduction.
Because a redox reaction involves both oxidation
and reduction, two half-reactions are needed to represent a redox reaction.
One half-reaction shows oxidation, and the other half-reaction shows
reduction.

Oxidation Numbers from Lewis Structures
You are probably familiar with the Lewis structure of water, shown in
Figure 10.4A. From the electronegativities on the periodic table in
Figure 10.5, on the next page, you can see that oxygen (electronegativity
3.44) is more electronegative than hydrogen (electronegativity 2.20).
The
electronegativity difference is less than 1.7 ,
s0 the two

covalent, not ionic. In each bond, the electrons are more
strongly attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atom.

Therefore, the element oxygen is
assigned an oxidation number of -2 in water: (Note: These are not ionic

Thus, the three shared

a result, the carbon atom is considered to have two valence electrons,
which is two electrons less than the four valence electrons of a neutral
carbon atom. Therefore, the carbon atom in CN- is assigned an oxidation

adding the correct number of electrons to balance the charges. For the

Half-Reaction Method for Balancing Redox Reactions
Recall that, if you consider a redox reaction as two half-reactions,
electrons are lost in the oxidation half-reaction, and electrons are gained
in the reduction half-reaction. For
example,
know the reaction of
zinc with aqueous copper(II) sulfate.

CuSO4laq)
+
ZnSO4(aq)
Removing the spectator ions leaves the following net ionic equation.

Zn2t(aq)
You can break the net ionic equation into two half-reactions:
Oxidation half-reaction: Zn
L
+ 2e"
Reduction half-reaction: Cuz+ + 2e
Cu
You can also start with the half-reactions and use them to
produce
a net
ionic equation. If you add the two half-reactions, the result is as follows.
Zn +
+ 2e
Cu +
Zn2+ + 2e
Removing the two electrons from each side results in the original net
ionic equation.
As shown above, you can
use
half-reactions to write balanced net
ionic equations for redox reactions In doing S0, you use the fact that
no electrons are created or destroyed in a redox reaction. Electrons
are transferred from one reactant (the
reducing agent) to another (the
oxidizing agent).

Steps for Balancing by the Half-Reaction Method
could balance the chemical equation for the reaction of magnesium
with aluminum nitrate by inspection, instead of writing half-reactions.
However; many redox equations are difficult to balance by the inspection
method In general, you can balance the net ionic equation for a redox
reaction by a process known as the half-reaction method The preceding
example of the reaction of magnesium with aluminum nitrate illustrates
this method. Specific steps for following the half-reaction method are
given below.
Step
1
Write an unbalanced net ionic
equation, if it is not already
Step
2
Divide the unbalanced net ionic equation into an oxidation
half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction. To do this, you
may need to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in
the net ionic equation to determine what is oxidized and what
is reduced.
3
Balance the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction independently.
Step
4
Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers
of electrons in the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction.

Use coefficients to write each half-reaction s0 that it includes

6
Add the balanced half-reactions that include the equal num-
bers of electrons.

7
Remove the electrons from both sides of the equation.
8
Remove any identical molecules or ions that are present on
both sides of the equation.

If you require a balanced chemical equation, include any

Step 10
If necessary, include the states.
When using the half-reaction method,
in mind that, in a redox
reaction, the number of electrons lost through oxidation must equal the
number of electrons gained through reduction. Figure 10.11 provides
another example.

The oxidation number of nitrogen increases from -3 to +4, an increase

example, zinc atoms undergo oxidation at the zinc electrode. Thus, the
zinc electrode is the anode of the Daniell cell. The electrode at which
reduction occurs is named the cathode. Here, copper(I) ions undergo
reduction at the copper electrode. Thus, the copper electrode is the
cathode of the Daniell cell.
Free electrons cannot travel through the solution: Instead, the external
circuit conducts electrons from the anode to the cathode of a galvanic
cell. Figure 11.2 gives a diagram of a typical galvanic cell.

At the anode of a
galvanic cell, electrons are released by oxidation.
For
example, at the zinc anode of the Daniell cell, zinc atoms release
electrons to become positive zinc ions. Thus, the anode of a galvanic
cell is negatively charged Relative to the anode, the cathode of a galvanic
cell is positively charged. In galvanic cells, electrons flow through the
external circuit from the negative electrode to the positive electrode.
These electrode polarities may already be familiar to you. An example
is shown in Figure 11.3.
Each half-cell contains a solution of a neutral
compound. In a

Suppose the salt
of a Daniell cell contains ammonium chloride
solution, NHCllaq): As positive zinc ions are produced at the anode,
negative chloride ions migrate from the salt
into the half-cell that
contains the anode.
As
positive copper(II) ions are removed from solution
at the cathode, positive ammonium ions migrate from the salt bridge into
the half-cell that contains the cathode.
Other electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate or potassium nitrate, could
be chosen for the salt
Neither of these
electrolytes interferes in the
cell reaction. Silver nitrate, AgNOz(aq), would be a poor choice for the salt
bridge, however: Positive silver ions would migrate into the half-cell that
contains the cathode
Zinc displaces both copper and silver from solution,
so both
copper(II) ions and silver ions would be reduced at the cathode.
The copper produced would be contaminated with silver:

As you saw in Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5, the anode may appear on the
left or on the right of a diagram. In the shorthand representation, however;
the anode is always shown on the left and the cathode on the right Each
single vertical line, |, represents a phase boundary between the electrode
and the solution in a half-cell: For
example, the first single vertical line
shows that the solid zinc and aqueous zinc ions are in different
phases
or
states. The double vertical line, Il, represents the porous barrier Or salt
bridge between the half-cells. Spectator ions are usually omitted.
Inert Electrodes
The zinc anode and copper cathode of a Daniell cell are both metals, and
can act as electrical conductors. However; some redox reactions involve
substances that cannot act as electrodes, such as gases o dissolved
electrolytes. Galvanic cells that involve such redox reactions use inert
electrodes.
An inert electrode is an electrode made from a material that
is neither a reactant nor a
product of the cell reaction. Figure 11.6 shows
a cell that contains one inert electrode. The chemical equation, net ionic
equation, and half-reactions for this cell are given below.

inserted into a lemon. However; you cannot generate electricity by
connecting two copper electrodes that have been inserted into the lemon.
The two copper electrodes are the same and are in contact with the same
electrolyte. There is no potential difference between the two electrodes.
Electric potentials vary from one cell to another; depending on various
factors. You will examine some of these factors in the next investigation.

Table 11.1 and the larger table in Appendix E are based on the following
conventions.
Each half-reaction is written as a reduction. The half-cell potential
for a reduction half-reaction is called a reduction potential. Look at
the molecules and ions on the left side of each half-reaction. The most
easily reduced molecules and ions (best oxidizing agents), such as Fz,

One method to calculate the standard cell potential is to subtract the
standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reduction
potential of the cathode.
Method 1:

For a Daniell cell, you know that copper is the cathode and zinc is the
anode. The relevant half-reactions and standard reduction potentials from

This calculation of the standard cell potential for the Daniell cell used
the mathematical concept that the subtraction of a negative number is
equivalent to the addition of its positive value.
You saw that
0.342 V
(-0.762 V) = 0.342 V + 0.762 V
In other words, the subtraction of the reduction potential for a
half-reaction is equivalent to the addition of the potential for the reverse
half-reaction. The reverse half-reaction of a reduction is an oxidation.
The half-cell potential for an oxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation
potential. If the reduction half-reaction is as follows,
Zn2tiaq) + 2e
Eo
=-0.762 V
then the oxidation half-reaction is
Zn2+taq) + 2e
Eoox = +0.762 V
To summarize, the standard cell potential can also be calculated as the
sum of a standard reduction
potential and a standard oxidation potential.
Method 2:
E"cell = Ered
+ Etox
As shown above, you can obtain the standard oxidation potential from
a
table of standard reduction potentials by reversing the reduction half-
reaction, and changing the sign of the relevant potential. The reduction
and oxidation half-reactions for the previous example are as follows.
Cu2tiaq) + 2e
Ered = 0.342 V
Zn2t(aq) + 2e
E'ox = +0.762 V
The calculation of the standard cell potential
these standard

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that you can calculate cell potentials by
tables of half-cell potentials The half-cell potential for a reduction
half-reaction is called a reduction
potential. The half-cell potential for an
oxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation potential. Standard half-cell
potentials
are
written as reduction
potentials. The values of standard
reduction potentials for half-reactions are relative to the reduction potential
of the standard hydrogen electrode.
You used standard reduction potentials
to calculate standard cell potentials for galvanic cells. You learned two
methods of calculating standard cell potentials. One method is to subtract
the standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reduction
potential of the cathode. The other method is to add the standard reduction
potential of the cathode and the standard oxidation potential of the anode.
In the next section, you will learn about a different type of cell, called an
electrolytic cell:

Electrolysis of Water
The electrolysis of aqueous solutions may not yield the desired products.
Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) discovered the elements sodium and
potassium by electrolyzing their molten salts. Before this discovery,
had electrolyzed aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium salts. He
had not succeeded in reducing the metal ions to the pure metals at the
cathode. Instead, his first experiments had produced hydrogen gas

The

Electrolytic cells are used for non-spontaneous redox reactions, s0 all
electrolytic cells have negative cell potentials.
The standard reduction potentials used to calculate Ecell for the
decomposition of water apply only to reactants and products in their
standard states. However, in pure water at 25*C, the hydrogen ions and
hydroxide ions each have concentrations of 1 X
mol/L. This is not

Using these new half-cell potentials, Ecell for the decomposition of
pure water at 25*C by electrolysis has a calculated value of -1.229 V
Therefore, the calculated value of the external voltage needed is 1.229.
In practice, the external voltage needed for an electrolytic cell is
always greater than the calculated value, especially for reactions involving
gases. Therefore, the actual voltage needed to electrolyze pure water is
greater than 1.229 V. The excess voltage required above the calculated
value is called the
overvoltage. Overvoltages depend on the gases
involved and on the materials in the electrodes.
When electrolyzing water; there is another practical difficulty to
consider: Pure water is a very pOor electrical conductor: To increase the
conductivity, an electrolyte that does not interfere in the reaction is added
to the water:

As stated previously, an electrolytic cell may have the same design as a

Predicting the Products of Electrolysis for an Aqueous Solution
The comparison of the Daniell cell with the electrolytic version of the cell
appears straightforward. One reaction is the reverse of the other: However;
you have just learned that the electrolysis of an aqueous solution may
involve the electrolysis of water: How can you predict the actual products
for this type of electrolysis reaction?
To predict the products of an electrolysis involving an aqueous
solution, you must examine all possible half-reactions and their reduction
potentials. Then, you must find the overall reaction that requires the
lowest external voltage. That is, you must find the overall cell reaction
with a
negative cell potential that is closest to zero
The next Sample
Problem shows you how to predict the products of the electrolysis of
an aqueous solution_
In practice, reaction products are sometimes different from the
products predicted,
the method described here. Predictions are least
reliable when the reduction potentials are close together; especially when
gaseous products are expected. However; there are many cases in which
the predictions are correct

Spontaneity of Reactions
You know that galvanic cells have positive standard cell potentials, and
that these cells use spontaneous chemical reactions to produce electricity:
You also know that electrolytic cells have negative standard cell potentials,
and that these cells use electricity to perform non-spontaneous chemical
reactions. Thus, you can
use the sign of the standard cell potential to pre-
dict whether a reaction is spontaneous Or not under standard conditions.

Rechargeable Batteries
In section 11.1, you learned about several primary (disposable)
batteries that contain galvanic cells. One of the most common secondary
(rechargeable) batteries is found in car engines.
Most cars contain a
lead-acid battery, shown in Figure 11.18.
When you turn the ignition,
a
surge of electricity from the battery starts the motor:
When in use, a lead-acid battery partially discharges. In other words,
the cells in the
battery operate as galvanic cells, and produce electricity
The reaction in each cell proceeds spontaneously in one direction. To
recharge the battery, a generator driven by the car engine supplies
electricity to the battery: The external voltage of the generator reverses
the reaction in the cells. The reaction in each cell now proceeds non-

You know that a balanced equation represents relationships between
the quantities of reactants and products. For a reaction that takes
in a cell, stoichiometric calculations can also include the quantity of
electricity produced O consumed. Stoichiometric calculations in electro-
chemistry make use of a familiar unit-_the mole
As a first
you need information about measurements in
electricity. You know that the flow of electrons through an external circuit
is called the electric current. It is measured in a unit called the ampere
(symbol A), named after the French physicist Andre Ampere (1775-1836).
The quantity of electricity, also known as the electric charge, is the
product of the current flowing through a circuit and the time for which it
flows. The quantity of electricity is measured in a unit called the coulomb
(symbol C) This unit is named after another French
physicist, Charles
Coulomb (1736-1806). The ampere and the coulomb are related, in that
one
coulomb is the quantity of electricity that flows through a circuit in
one second if the current is one ampere. This
relationship can be written
mathematically:
charge (in coulombs)
=
current (in amperes) X time (in seconds)
For
example, suppose a current of 2.00
A
flows for 5.00 min. You can use
this information to find the quantity of electricity, in coulombs.

The information you have just learned permits a very precise
control of electrolysis. For example, suppose you modify a Daniell cell
to operate as an
electrolytic cell. You want to plate 0.1 mol of zinc onto
the zinc electrode.
The coefficients in the half-reaction for the reduction
represent stoichiometric relationships. Figure 11.23 shows that two
moles of electrons are needed for each mole of zinc deposited. Therefore,
to deposit 0.1 mol of zinc, you need to use 0.2 mol of electrons.

example, the current is less than

The preceding Sample Problem gave an example of the mathematical use
of Faraday's law. Faraday's law states that the amount of a substance
produced or consumed in an electrolysis reaction is directly proportional
to the quantity of electricity that flows through the circuit:
To illustrate this statement, think about changing the quantity of
electricity used in the Sample Problem. Suppose this quantity were
doubled by
the same current; 500 mA, for twice the time, 3 h
As a result, the amount of electrons passing into the cell would also be
doubled.

After the extraction stage, some metals are refined in electrolytic cells.
For
example, copper is about 99% pure after extraction:
This copper
is pure enough for some uses, such as the manufacture of copper pipes
for plumbing: However; the copper is not pure enough for one of its
principal uses, electrical wiring: Therefore, some of the impure copper is

The rusting of iron involves the reaction of iron, oxygen, and water in a

A rust deposit may contain a mixture of these compounds.
Fortunately, not all metals corrode to the same extent as iron:
metals do corrode in air to form a surface coating of metal oxide.
However; in many cases, the oxide layer adheres, Or sticks firmly, to the
metal surface.
This layer protects the metal from further corrosion. For
example, aluminum, chromium, and magnesium are readily oxidized in
air to form their oxides, AlzO3, C1203 , and MgO.
Unless the oxide layer is
broken by a cut Or a scratch, the
layer prevents further corrosion
In
con-
trast, rust easily flakes off from the surface of an iron object ad provides
little protection
further corrosion.
Corrosion Prevention
Corrosion, and especially the corrosion of iron, can be very destructive.
For this reason, a great deal of effort goes into corrosion prevention. The
simplest method of preventing corrosion is to
an iron object. The
protective coating of
prevents air and water from reaching the metal
surface. Other effective protective layers include grease, oil, plastic, o &
metal that is more resistant to corrosion than iron. For
example,
a
layer
of chromium protects bumpers and metal trim on cars. An enamel coating
is often used to protect metal plates, pots, and pans. Enamel is & shiny,
hard, and very unreactive type of glass that can be melted onto a metal
surface.
A
protective layer is effective as
as it
completely covers the
iron object: If a hole O scratch breaks the layer; the metal underneath
can corrode.
It is also possible to protect iron against corrosion by forming an
with a different metal. Stainless steel is an
of iron that contains at
least 10% chromium, by mass, in addition to small quantities of carbon
and occasionally metals such as nickel: Stainless steel is much more
resistant to corrosion than pure iron. Therefore, stainless steel is often
used for cutlery, taps, and various other applications where rust-resistance
is important: However; chromium is much more expensive than iron.
As
a result, stainless steel is too expensive for use in large-scale applications,
such as
building bridges.
Galvanizing is a process in which iron is covered with a protective
layer of zinc. Galvanized iron is often used to make metal buckets and
chain-link fences. Galvanizing protects iron in two ways. First, the zinc
acts as a
protective layer: If this layer is broken, the iron is exposed to
air and water: When this
happens, however; the iron is still protected
Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron. Therefore, zinc, not iron, becomes
the anode in the galvanic cell. The zinc metal is oxidized to zinc ions. In
this situation, zinc is known as a sacrificial anode, because it is destroyed
(sacrificed) to protect the iron. Iron acts as the cathode when zinc is pres-
ent: Thus, iron does not
undergo oxidation until all the zinc has reacted.

Cathodic protection is another method of preventing rusting, a8
shown in Figure 11.29.
As in galvanizing, a more reactive metal is
attached to the iron object: This reactive metal acts as a sacrificial anode,
and the iron becomes the cathode of a galvanic cell. Unlike galvanizing,
the metal used in cathodic protection does not completely cover the iron.
Because the sacrificial anode is slowly destroyed by oxidation, it must be
replaced periodically:
If iron is covered with a protective layer of a metal that is less reactive
than iron, there can be unfortunate results.
A

'tin" can is actually a steel
can coated with a thin
layer of tin.
While the tin layer remains intact, it
provides effective protection against rusting: If the tin layer is broken O

the tin than the iron would on its own. Since tin is less reactive than
iron, tin acts as a cathode in each

Automobile Engines
The internal combustion engine found in most automobiles uses
gasoline as a fuel Unfortunately, this type of engine produces pollutants,
such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) These pollutants contribute to health and
environmental problems, such as smog and the greenhouse effect In
addition, the internal combustion engine is very inefficient: It converts
only about 25% of the chemical energy of the fuel into the kinetic
energy of the car: Electric cars, such as those shown in Figure 11.30,
may provide a more efficient and less harmful alternative.
Figure 11.30
Many electric cars
are
currently under development:
In fact; the idea of electric cars is
not new: In the early days of the
automobile, electric cars were more
common than gasoline-powered
cars The production of electric cars
peaked in 1912, but then completely
stopped in the 1930s.
Manufacturers and researchers have attempted to power
electric cars with
rechargeable batteries, such as modified lead-acid
and nickel-cadmium batteries. However, rechargeable batteries run
down fairly quickly The distance driven before recharging a battery
may be 250 km or less The battery must then be recharged from an
external electrical source_
Recharging the lead-acid battery of an electric
car takes several hours. Cars based on a version of the nickel-cadmium
battery can be recharged in only fifteen minutes. However; recharging
the batteries of an electric car is still inconvenient.
A
new
type of power supply for electric cars eliminates the need for
recharging: A fuel cell is a battery that
produces electricity while reactants
are
supplied continuously from an external source. Because reactants
continuously flow into the cell, a fuel cell is also known as a flow battery.
Unlike the fuel supply of a more conventional battery, the fuel supply in a
fuel cell is unlimited.
As in the combustion of gasoline in a conventional
engine, the overall reaction in a fuel cell is the oxidation of a fuel by oxygen.
The space shuttle uses a fuel cell as a source of energy. This cell
depends on the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to form water: The
fuel cell operates under basic conditions, s0 it is sometimes referred to
as an alkaline
fuel cell. Figure 11.31, on the next page, shows the design
of the cell. The half-reactions and the overall reaction are as follows_
Reduction (occurs at the cathode):

2HzOre) + 4e
~
4OH (aq)
Oxidation (occurs at the anode):
+ 2OH (aq)
2HzOre) + 2e
Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 2, add the two half-reactions, and
simplify to obtain the overall cell reaction.
+
2HzOre)
Notice that the overall equation is the same as the equation for the
combustion of hydrogen: The combustion of hydrogen is an exothermic
reaction. In the fuel cell, this reaction produces energy in the form of
electricity, rather than heat:

In an alkaline fuel cell, the half-reactions do not include solid conductors of
electrons. Therefore, the cell has two inert electrodes.
The hydrogen fuel cell produces water vapour; which does not contribute
to smog formation or to the
greenhouse effect This product makes the
hydrogen fuel cell an attractive energy source for cars_
Also, the hydrogen
fuel cell is much more efficient than the internal combustion engine.
A
hydrogen fuel cell converts about 80% of the chemical energy of the fuel
into the kinetic energy of the car:
There is a
possible problem with the hydrogen fuel cell The cell
requires hydrogen fuel Unfortunately, uncombined hydrogen is not found
naturally on Earth: Most hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbon fuels,
as
petroleum
or
methane. These manufacturing processes may
contribute significantly to pollution problems. However, hydrogen can
also be produced by the electrolysis of water: If a source such as solar
energy or hydroelectricity is used to power the electrolysis, the overall
quantity of pollution is low
The
following practice problems will allow you to test your
understanding of fuel cells.

Water Treatment and the Chlor-Alkali Process
In many countries, water is not safe to drink: Untreated water is
sometimes
polluted with toxic chemicals. It may also carry numerous
water-borne diseases, including typhoid fever; cholera, and dysentery:
In Canada, the water that comes through your tap has been through an
elaborate purification process. This process is designed to remove solid
particles and toxic chemicals, and to reduce the number of bacteria
to safe levels.
Adding chlorine to water is the most common way to
destroy bacteria.
You have already seen that chlorine gas can be made by the
electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. In industry, some chlorine is
produced in this way
the Downs cell described earlier: However;
more chlorine is
produced in Canada using a different method, called
the chlor-alkali process. In this process, brine is electrolyzed in a cell
like the one shown in Figure 11.32. Brine is a saturated solution of
sodium chloride.

The chlor-alkali cell in this diagram electrolyzes an aqueous solution of

The asbestos diaphragm stops the chlorine gas produced at the anode from mixing with the
hydrogen gas produced at the cathode. Sodium hydroxide solution is removed from the cell
periodically, and fresh brine is added to the cell.
The half-reactions and the overall cell reaction in the chlor-alkali process

The products of the chlor-alkali process are all useful. Sodium hydroxide
is used to make soaps and detergents. It is widely used as a base in many
other industrial chemical reactions, as well The hydrogen produced by
the chlor-alkali process is used as a fuel. Chlorine has many uses besides
water treatment: For
example, chlorine is used as a bleach in the pulp and
paper industry. Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of chlorinated
organic compounds,
as the common plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
The chlorination of water is usually carried out by adding chlorine
gas, sodium hypochlorite, o calcium hypochlorite to the water in low

bottled spring water: There is controversy over the level of risk associated
with chlorination, and over the possible benefits of spring water: For
example, hypochlorous acid reacts with traces of organic materials in
the water
supply: These reactions can produce toxic substances, such as
chloroform. Supporters of chlorination believe that these substances are
present at very low, safe levels, but opponents of chlorination disagree.

Iodine solutions may be used to titrate solutions that contain
antioxidants , such as vitamin C.
(a) In storage, the concentration of iodine in solution decreases fairly
quickly over time. Why do you think this happens?
(b) Because the iodine solution's concentration is not stable, it should be
standardized frequently. To standardize an iodine solution, use it to
titrate a solution that contains a known quantity of vitamin C. Then
determine what volume of iodine solution is needed to react with
the known quantity of vitamin C. Explain how you

Design a titration that uses an iodine solution to determine and
compare the concentration of vitamin C in a variety of fresh fruit
juices. You may find it helpful to research appropriate procedures on
the Internet: Include a method for standardizing the iodine solution:
(See Challenge question 1.) Make sure that you list all the safety
precautions you will use in your titration. Check your procedure
with your teacher; and then carry out your titration.
Prepare a detailed report to communicate your results. Include the
half-reaction for iodine in your discussion of the titration.

If you titrate orange juice that has been exposed to the air for
a
week, will the vitamin C concentration be different from the vitamin
concentration in fresh juice? If s0, will it decrease Or increase?
Explain your prediction, in terms of redox reactions.
If time permits, extend your investigation to compare the vitamin C
content of fresh juice and juice that has been left exposed to air for
varying periods of time.
Ask your teacher to approve your procedure
before carrying out this extension:

continuously on the work and the discoveries of other scientists.
Long before humans developed a scientific understanding of the
world,
invented chemical
techniques and processes.
These tech-
niques and processes included smelting and shaping metals, growing
crops, and making medicines. Early chemists invented technological
instruments, such as glassware and distillation equipment
Present-day chemical technologists continue to invent new equipment:

people want. Chemical technologists ask questions such as the following:

What methods can
we use, or
develop, to make water safe to drink?
How can

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for life on Earth: Plants need

waste from the body. Thus, it is present in human sewage.
Since phosphorus promotes plant growth, phosphates are excellent

You will learn more about phosphates later in this unit.) Phosphates are
also used as food additives, and as components in some medicines. In

Phosphates Causing Trouble
In the 1960s, residents around Lake Erie began to notice problems. Thick
growths of algae carpeted the surface of the water: Large amounts of the
algae washed onto beaches, making the beaches unfit for swimming: The
water in the lake looked green, and had an
unpleasant odour: As time
passed, certain fish species in Lake Erie began to decrease.

After pressure from the government; detergent companies
reduced the amount of phosphate in their products by about 90%. Cities
on Lake Erie spent millions of dollars
adding phosphorus removal to their
waste treatment.
Lake Erie has almost completely recovered:

Why
Using Measurements to Describe Matter
In the investigation, you measured the size and mass of a piece of alu-
minum foil. You have probably performed these types of measurement
many times before. Measurements are
s0 much & part of your daily life
that you can easily take them for granted. The clothes you wear come in
different sizes.
Much of the food you eat is sold by the gram, kilogram,
millilitre, or litre.
When you follow a
you measure amounts. The
dimensions of paper and coins are made to exact
specifications
The value
of money is itself a measurement.
Measurements such as clothing size, amounts of food, and currency
are not standard, however:
Clothing sizes in Europe are different from
those in North America: European chefs tend to measure liquids and
powdered solids by mass, rather than
volume. Currencies, of course:
differ widely from country to country:
To communicate effectively, scientists rely on a standard system of
measurement:
As you have learned in previous studies, this system is
called the International System of Units (Le systeme international
d'unites, SI). It allows scientists anywhere in the world to describe
matter in the same quantitative language. There are seven base SI units,
and many more units that are derived from them. The metre (m), the
kilogram (kg), and the second (s) are three of the base SI units.
You will
learn about
more base units, the mole (mol) and the kelvin (K), later
in this book:
When you describe matter; you use terms such as mass, volume, and
temperature.
When you measure matter; you use units such as grams,
cubic centimetres, and degrees Celsius. Table 1.3 lists some quantities and
units that you will use often in this course_
You are familiar with all of
them except; perhaps, for the mole and the kelvin: The mole is one of the
most important units for describing amounts of matter:
You will be intro-
duced to the mole in Unit 2
The kelvin is used to measure temperature.
You will learn more about the kelvin scale in Unit 5

Significant Digits, Certainty, and Measurements
All measurements involve uncertainty One source of this uncertainty
is the
measuring device itself Another source is YoUr ability to perceive
and interpret a reading: In fact, you cannot measure anything with
complete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement is
always an estimate.
The digits that you record when you measure something are called
significant digits  Significant digits include the digits that you are certain
about and a final, uncertain digit that you estimate.
For example, 4.28 g
has three significant digits. The first two digits, the 4 and the 2, are
certain. The last digit, the 8, is an estimate. Therefore, it is uncertain.
The value 4.3 has two significant digits. The 4 is certain, and the 3 is
uncertain.
How Can You Tell Which Digits Are Significant?
You can identify the number of significant digits in any value

Explaining Three Significant Digits
The Great Lakes contain 22 700 km3 of water: Is there exactly that amount
of water in the Great Lakes? No, 22 700 km3 is an approximate value: The
actual volume could be anywhere from 22 651 km3 to 22 749 km? .
You can
use scientific notation to rewrite 22 700 km3 as 2.27 X 104 km _
This shows
that only three digits are significant: (See Appendix E at the back of the
book, if you would like to review scientific notation:)
Explaining Five Significant Digits
What if you were able to measure the volume of water in the Great Lakes?
You could verify the value of 22 700 km?. Then all five digits (including the
zeros) would be significant: Here again, scientific notation lets you show
clearly the five significant digits: 2.2700 x 104 km? _

Accuracy and Precision
In everyday speech, you might use the terms
accuracy'
and
'precision
to mean the same
In science, however; these terms are related to
certainty. Each; then, has a specific meaning:
Accuracy refers to how close a given quantity is to an accepted o
expected value. (See Figure 1.7.) Precision may refer to the exactness of a
measurement. For
example, ruler B in Figure 1.5 lets you measure length
with greater precision than ruler A, Precision may also refer to the close-
ness of a series of data
Data that are very close to one another are
said to be precise. Examine Figure 1.8. Notice that a set of data can be
precise but not accurate.

Calculating with Significant Digits
In this course, you will often take measurements and use them to calcu-
late other quantities. You must be careful to
track of which digits
in your calculations and results are significant. Why? Your results
should not imply more certainty than your measured quantities justify
This is especially important when you use
a
calculator: Calculators
usually report results with far more figures
S
greater certainty
than
your data warrant. Always remember that calculators do not make
decisions about certainty You do.
There are three rules for reporting significant digits in calculated
answers.
These rules are summarized in Table 1.5. Reflect on how
apply to your previous experiences Then examine the Sample
Problems that follow.
Table 1.5
Rules for Reporting Significant Digits in Calculations
Rule 1: Multiplying and Dividing
The value with the fewest number of significant digits, going into the
calculation, determines the number of significant digits that you should
report in your answer:
Rule 2: Adding and Subtracting
The value with the fewest number of decimal places, going into the
calculation, determines the number of decimal places that you should
report in your answer:
Rule 3: Rounding
To get the appropriate number of significant digits (rule 1) or decimal
places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer:
If your answer ends in a number that is greater than 5, increase the
preceding digit by
1
For example, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35.
If your answer ends with a number that is less than 5, leave the preceding
number unchanged: For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7
If your answer ends with 5, increase the preceding number by
if it is odd:
Leave the preceding number unchanged if it is even_
For example, 18.35
can be rounded to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded to 18.2.

Chemistry, Calculations, and Communication
Mathematical calculations are an important part of chemistry You will
need your calculation skills to help you investigate many of the topics in
this textbook. You will also need calculation skills to communicate your
measurements and results clearly when you do activities and investiga-
tions. Chemistry, however; is more than measurements and calculations.
Chemistry also involves finding and interpreting patterns.
This is the
focus of the next section.

Air Canada Flight 143
By multiplying 7682 L by 1.77, Pearson
calculated that the airplane had 13 597 kg of
fuel on board. He subtracted this value from
the total amount of fuel for the trip, 22 300 kg,
and found that 8703 kg more fuel
was
needed.
To convert kilograms back into litres,
Pearson divided the mass, 8703 kg; by 1.77 .
The result was 4916 La
The crew added 4916 L
of fuel to the airplane's tanks.
This conversion number; 1.77, had been
used in the past because the density of jet fuel
is 1.77 pounds per litre. Unfortunately, the
number that should have been used to convert
litres into kilograms was 0.803. The crew
should have added 20 088 L of fuel, not 4916 L.

Like all matter; water can change its state when energy is added or removed.
Physical and Chemical Changes in Matter
A
change of state alters the appearance of matter: The composition of
matter remains the same, however; regardless of its state. For example, ice,
liquid water; and water vapour are all the same kind of matter: water:
Melting and boiling other kinds of matter have the same result: The
appearance and some other physical properties change, but the matter
retains its identity_-its composition. Changes that affect the physical
appearance of matter; but not its composition, are physical changes.
Figure 1.10 shows a different kind of change involving water:
Electrical energy is passed through water; causing it to decompose. Two
completely different kinds of matter result from this process: hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas. These gases have physical and chemical properties that
are
different from the properties of water and from each other's properties.
Therefore, decomposing water is a change that affects the composition of

Classifying Matter
All matter can be classified into two groups: mixtures and pure
stances. A mixture is a
physical combination of two o more kinds of
matter: For
example, soil is a mixture of sand,
silt; and decom-
posed leaves and animal bodies. If you look at soil under a magnifying
glass, you can see these different components. Figure 1.11 shows
another way to see the components of soil:
The components in & mixture can OCCur in different proportions
(relative quantities). Each individual component retains its identity:
Mixtures in which the different components are clearly visible are

The Group-Related Pattern
The second pattern emerges when you consider the electron arrangements
in the main-group elements: the elements in Groups 1 (IA), 2 (IIA), and
13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA).
All the elements in each main group have the same
number of electrons in their highest (outer) energy level. The electrons
that occupy the outer energy level are called valence electrons. The term
svalence
comes from a Latin word that means
'to be strong:
<Valence
electrons
is a suitable name because the outer energy level electrons are
the electrons involved when atoms form compounds. In other words,
valence electrons are
responsible for the chemical behaviour of elements.
Chapter 2
Elements and the Periodic Table
MHR
45
You can infer the number of valence electrons in any main-group
element from its group number: For example, Group 1 (IA) elements have
one valence electron. Group 2 (IIA) elements have two valence electrons.
For elements in Groups 13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA), the number of valence
electrons is the same as the second digit in the current numbering system.
It is the same as the only digit in the older numbering system. For exam-
ple, elements in Group 15 (VA) have 5 valence electrons. The elements in
Group 17 (VIIA) have 7 valence electrons.
Using Lewis Structures to Represent Valence Electrons
It is time-consuming to draw electron arrangements
Bohr-Rutherford
diagrams. It is much simpler to use Lewis structures to represent elements
and the valence electrons of their atoms. To draw a Lewis structure, yOu
replace the nucleus and inner energy levels of an atom with its atomic
symbol. Then you place dots around the atomic
to represent the
valence electrons. The order in which you place the first four dots
is up to you. You may find it simplest to start at the top and proceed
clockwise: right, then bottom, then left.
Examine Figure 2.11, and then complete the Practice Problems that
follow. In Chapter 3, you will use Lewis structures to help you visualize
what happens when atoms combine to form compounds.

naturally form compounds with other atoms (Scientists have manipulated
several of these elements in the laboratory to make them react, however:)
What is it about the noble gases that
this behaviour?
Recall that chemical reactivity is determined by valence electrons.
Thus, there must be
something about the arrangement of the electrons in
the noble gases that
their unreactivity All the noble gases have
outer energy levels that are completely filled with the maximum number
of electrons. Helium has a full outer energy level of two valence electrons.
The other noble gases have eight valence electrons in the outer energy
level. Chemists reason that having a full outer energy level must be a very
stable electron arrangement:
What does this stability mean? It means that a full outer energy level
is unlikely to change. Scientists have observed that, in nature, situations
or
systems of lower energy are favoured over situations O systems of
higher energy: For example, a book on
a
high shelf has more potential
energy (is less stable) than a book on a lower shelf. If you move a book
from a
high shelf to a lower shelf; it has less potential energy (is more
stable). If you move a book to the floor; it has low potential energy
(is much more stable).
When atoms have eight electrons in the outer energy level (Or two
electrons for hydrogen and helium), chemists say that
have a
stable octet; Often this term is shortened to just octet: An octet is a very
stable electron arrangement: As you will see in Chapter 3, an octet is
often the result of changes in which atoms combine to form compounds.
Section Wrap-up
You have seen that the structure of the
periodic table is directly related to
energy levels and arrangements of electrons. The patterns that emerge
from this relationship enable you to predict the number of valence elec-
trons for any main group element:
also enable you to
predict the
number of energy levels that an element's electrons occupy The relation-
ship between electrons and the position of elements in the periodic table
leads to other patterns, as well. You will examine several of these patterns
in the next section.

Trends for Atomic Size (Radius)
There are two general trends for atomic size:
As
go down each group in the periodic table, the size of an atom
increases. This makes sense if you consider energy levels.
As you g0
down a group, the valence electrons occupy an energy level that is
farther and farther from the nucleus. Thus, the valence electrons experi-
ence less attraction for the nucleus. In addition, electrons in the inner
energy levels block, or shield, the valence electrons from the attraction
of the nucleus.
As a result; the total volume of the atom, and thus the
size, increases with each additional energy level
As you go across 4 period, the size of an atom decreases. This trend
might surprise you at first, since the number of electrons increases as
you g0 across
a
You might think that more electrons would
occupy more space, making the atom larger: You might also think that
repulsion from their like charges would force the electrons farther apart:
The size of an atom decreases, however, because the positive charge on
the nucleus also increases across a
As well, without additional
energy the electrons are restricted to their outer energy level. For exam-
the outer energy level for Period 2 elements is the second energy
level. Electrons cannot move beyond this energy level.
As a result; the
positive force exerted by the nucleus
the outer electrons closer;
reducing the atom's total size.

Summarizing Trends for lonization Energy
Although you can see a few
exceptions in Figure 2.16, there are two
general trends for ionization energy:
Ionization energy tends to decrease down a group. This makes sense in
terms of the energy level that the valence electrons occupy. Electrons in
the outer energy level are farther from the positive force of the nucleus
Thus ,
are easier to remove than electrons in lower energy levels.
Ionization energy tends to increase across 4 period. As you g0 across a
period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer
energy level increases. Thus, more energy is needed to
an electron
away from its atom.
For this trend to be true, you would expect a noble
gas to have the highest ionization energy of all the elements in the same
period. As you can see in Figure 2.16, they do.
Figure 2.17 summarizes these general trends for ionization energy:

Trends for Electron Affinity

have an
affinity for it: For example, what if you enjoy pizza and detest
asparagus? You may say that you have a high affinity for pizza and a
low affinity for asparagus. If you

do not like or dislike anything:
You know; however; that some atoms have a low attraction for electrons.
Other atoms have & greater attraction for electrons. Electron affinity is a
measure of the
change in energy that occurs when an electron is added
to the outer energy level of an atom to form a negative ion.
Figure 2.18 identifies the electron affinities of the main-group
elements. If energy is released when an atom of an element
an
electron, the electron affinity is expressed as a negative integer: When
energy is absorbed when an electron is added, electron affinity is low, and
is expressed as a
positive integer: Notice, for example, that fluorine has
the highest electron affinity (indicated by a large, negative integer). This
indicates that fluorine is very likely to be involved in chemical reactions.
In fact, fluorine is the most reactive of all the elements.
Metals have very low electron affinities. This is especially true for the
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements.
Atoms of these elements form stable
positive ions.
A
negative ion that is formed by the elements of these
groups is unstable. It breaks apart into a neutral atom and a free electron.

Figure 3.2. Although this use of sodium chloride increases the safety of
pedestrians and drivers, there are several drawbacks. For example, the
saltwater discolours and damages footwear, and it corrodes the metal
bodies of cars and trucks. Also, as shown in Figure 3.3, deer and moose
that are attracted to the salt on the roads can be struck by vehicles.
Figure 3.2
Sodium chloride is
used to melt ice because salt

Figure 3.3
This moose was attracted to the sodium chloride that was put on the road
to melt snow and ice. Humans, like most organisms, need sodium to maintain normal
body functions:
Sodium chloride is a typical ionic compound. Like most ionic com-
pounds, it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It melts at a very
high temperature, at 801*C.
As well, it dissolves easily in water:
A solu-

Carbon Dioxide: A Covalent Compound
The cells of most organisms produce carbon dioxide, COz,
during cellular respiration: the process that releases energy
from food. Plants, like the ones shown in Figure 3.4,
size their own food from carbon dioxide and water using
the Sun's energy.
Carbon dioxide has most of the properties of a typical
covalent compound. It has a low
melting
(-79'C).
At
certain pressures and temperatures, carbon dioxide is a liq-
uid. Liquid carbon dioxide is a weak conductor of electricity:

Carbon dioxide is somewhat soluble in water; especially at high pressures.
This is why soft drinks are bottled under pressure. When you open a

this happens too quickly, as you can see in Figure 3.5.

can
we
divide compounds into two categories that display distinct physical
properties? The answers come from an
understanding of chemical bonds:
the forces that attract atoms to each other in compounds. Bonding
involves the interaction between the valence electrons of atoms. Usually
the formation of a bond between two atoms creates a
compound that is
more stable than either of the two atoms on their own.
The different properties of ionic and covalent compounds result from
the manner in which chemical bonds form between atoms in these com-
pounds. Atoms can either exchange O share electrons.

in water; and the water solution conducts electricity. These properties are
characteristic of an ionic compound. Is there & clear; theoretical way to
decide whether the bond between hydrogen and chlorine is ionic O

periodic trend.
Electronegativity: Attracting Electrons
When two atoms form a bond, each atom attracts the other atom's
electrons in addition to its own. The electronegativity of an atom is a
measure of an atom's
ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. EN
is used to symbolize electronegativity There is a specific electronegativity
associated with each element:
As you can see in Figure 3.6, electronegativity is a periodic property,
just as atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity are. Atomic
Size, ionization energy, and electron affinity, however; are properties of
single atoms. In contrast, electronegativity is & property of atoms that are

At the same time, the number of filled, inner electron

the same.
Thus the electrons are

Predicting Bond Type Using Electronegativity
You can use the differences between electronegativities to decide whether
the bond between two atoms is ionic o covalent: The symbol AEN stands
for the difference between two electronegativity values. When calculating
the electronegativity difference, the smaller electronegativity is always
subtracted from the
electronegativity, s0 that the electronegativity
difference is always positive.
How can the electronegativity difference help
predict the type of
bond? By the end of this section, you will understand the aswer to this
question. Consider three different substances: potassium fluoride, KF,
oxygen, 0z, and hydrochloric acid, HCL. Potassium fluoride is an ionic
compound made up of a metal and a non-metal that have very different
electronegativities. Potassium's electronegativity is 0.82. Fluorine's
electronegativity is 3.98. Therefore, AEN for the bond between potassium
and fluorine is 3.16.
Now consider oxygen. This element exists as units of two atoms held
together by covalent bonds. Each oxygen atom has an electronegativity of
3.44. The bond that holds the oxygen atoms together has an electronega-
tivity difference of 0.00 because each atom in an oxygen molecule has an
equal attraction for the bonding
of electrons.
Finally, consider hydrogen chloride, or hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen
has an electronegativity of 2.20, and chlorine has an electronegativity of
3.16. Therefore, the electronegativity difference for the chemical bond in
hydrochloric acid, HCl, is 0.96. Hydrogen chloride is a gas at room tem-
perature, but its water solution conducts electricity. Is hydrogen chloride
a covalent
compound o an ionic compound? Its AEN can help you
decide, as you will see below.

The Range of Electronegativity Differences
When two atoms have electronegativities that are identical, as in oxygen,
share their bonding
of electrons equally between them in a
covalent bond.
When two atoms have electronegativities that are very dif-
ferent; as in
potassium fluoride, the atom with the lower electronegativity
loses an electron to the atom with the higher electronegativity: In
potassium fluoride, potassium gives up its valence electron to fluorine.
Therefore, the bond is ionic.
It is not always clear whether atoms share electrons O transfer them.
Atoms with different electronegativities can share electrons unequally
without exchanging them. How unequal does the sharing have to be
before the bond is considered ionic?
Figure 3.8 shows the range of electronegativity differences. These
values go from mostly covalent at 0.0 to mostly ionic at 3.3. Chemists
consider bonds with an electronegativity difference that is greater than
1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity difference that is less
than 1.7 to be covalent.

Based on Table 3.2, what kind of bond forms between hydrogen and

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you learned that most elements do not exist in their pure
form in nature. Rather;
exist as different
compounds. You reviewed
the characteristic properties of ionic and covalent compounds. You
considered the periodic nature of electronegativity, and you learned how
to use the
electronegativity difference to predict the type of bond. You
learned, for
example, that ionic bonds form between two atoms with very
different electronegativities.
In section 3.2, you will explore ionic and covalent bonding in terms
of electron transfer and sharing: You will use your understanding of
the nature of

is ionic. Calcium has two electrons in its outer energy level, s0 it needs

To achieve a stable octet, carbon

oxygen requires two electrons. Hence, two atoms of oxygen bond to one

Metallic Bonding
In this chapter; you have seen that non-metals tend to form ionic
bonds with metals. Non-metals tend to form covalent bonds with other
non-metals and with themselves. How do metals bond to each other?
We know that elements that tend to form ionic bonds have very
different electronegativities. Metals bonding to themselves O to other
metals do not have electronegativity differences that are greater than 1.7.
Therefore, metals probably do not form ionic bonds with each other:
Evidence bears this out. A pure metal, such as sodium, is soft enough
to be cut with a butter knife.
Other pure metals, such as copper Or
can be drawn into wires or hammered into sheets. Ionic
compounds, by contrast, are hard and brittle.
Do metals form covalent bonds with each other? No.

What a Chemical Formula Represents
For covalent compounds, the chemical formula represents how many of
each type of atom are in each molecule. For
example, the formula NH:
signifies that a molecule of ammonia contains one nitrogen atom and
three hydrogen atoms. The formula CzHs tells you that a molecule of
propane contains two atoms of carbon and six atoms of hydrogen.
For ionic compounds, the formula represents a ratio rather than
a discrete
particle. For example, the formula for magnesium oxide, MgO,
signifies that magnesium and oxygen exist in a one-to-one atomic ratio.
Recall that MgO exists in a lattice structure held together by ionic bonds,
as
shown in Figure 3.41.
The formula MgO represents the ratio in which

molecules. Is
there a faster and easier method for writing chemical formulas?
Every element has a certain capacity to combine with other atoms.
An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element, for
example, has the capacity to lose
one electron from its valence level in order to bond with another atom:
A number is assigned to each element to describe the element's bonding
capacity. This number is called the valence. Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements,
such as sodium and lithium, have & valence of +1. The 1 indicates that
these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding: This makes
sense, because Group 1 elements have only one electron in their outer
electron energy level. The + indicates that these elements tend to give up
their electrons, becoming positively charged ions.

electrons, Or
may attract the electron relatively weakly in a

On the other hand, Group 17 (VIIA) elements (the halogens) have a
valence of _1. Again, the 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one
electron involved in bonding: However;

As a
general rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence tells
you the charges on the ions that are formed. If a covalent bond is formed,
the valence tells you how many electrons the atoms contribute to the
covalent bond.
You can
use the
periodic table to predict valence numbers. For
example, Group 2 (IIA) elements have two electrons in their outer energy
level. To achieve a stable octet,
need to lose these two electrons.
Therefore, the valence for all Group 2 elements is +2.

Explain your answer:
The smaller atoms of elements in the first two periods usually have
one common valence, which is easily determined from the periodic table.
Many larger elements, however; have more than one valence because the
electron distribution in these elements is much more complex: Therefore,
will have to memorize the valences of the elements that are common-
ly used in this course. Some useful valences are listed in Table 3.3, with

Polyatomic lons
Some compounds contain ions that are made from more than one atom.
66_
These ions are called polyatomic ions. (The prefix poly means
many.")
Calcium carbonate, CaCO3
which is found in chalk; contains one calcium
cation and one polyatomic anion called carbonate, CO32-
Polyatomic ions are in fact charged molecules. For example, the car-
bonate ion consists of one carbon atom
covalently bonded to three oxygen
atoms. The entire molecule has a
charge of -2. Therefore, its valence is -2
as well: Polyatomic ions remain unchanged in simple chemical reactions
because of the strong bonds that hold the component atoms together:
behave as a single unit and should be treated as a single ion.

Naming Chemical Compounds
When writing a chemical formula, you learned that you write the metal
element first. Similarly, the metal comes first when naming a chemical
compound: For example, sodium chloride is formed from the metal
sodium and the non-metal chlorine. Think of other names you have seen
in this chapter; such as beryllium chloride, calcium oxide, and aluminum
oxide.
In each case, the metal is first and the non-metal is second. In other
words, the cation is first and the anion is second. This is just one of the
rules in chemical nomenclature: the system that is used in chemistry for
naming compounds.
A chemical formula identifies a
specific chemical compound because
it reveals the
composition of the compound  Similarly, the name of a
compound distinguishes the compound from all other compounds.

examples of common (trivial) names
for familiar
compounds.
Early chemists routinely gave trivial names to substances before
understanding their chemical structure and behaviour: This situation
changed during the mid- to late-1800s. By this time, chemistry was
firmly established as a science. Chemists observed and discovered new
patterns of chemical relationships (such as periodicity)
As well, chemists
discovered new chemical compounds with tremendous frequency The
rapidly increasing number of chemical compounds required a more
organized method of nomenclature.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)

The main aim of IUPAC was to

developed, and continues to develop, & consistent and thorough system
of nomenclature for compounds.

Naming Binary Compounds Containing a Metal and a Non-metal
A
binary compound is an inorganic compound that contains two elements
Binary compounds may contain a metal and a non-metal Or two non-
metals. Binary compounds are often ionic compounds. To name a
ionic compound, name the cation first and the anion second. For example,
the compound that contains sodium and chlorine is called sodium chlo-
ride
In the subsections that follow, you will examine the rules for
naming
metals and non-metals in binary compounds.
Naming Metals in Chemical Compounds: The Stock System
The less electronegative element in a binary compound is always named
first. Often this element is a metal. You use the same name as the element.
For
example, sodium chloride; NaCl, calcium oxide, CaO, and zinc
sulfide, ZnS, contain the metals sodium, calcium, and zinc
Many of the common metals are transition elements that have more
than one
possible valence. For example, tin is able to form the ions Sn2+
and Sn4+
iron can form Fe2+ and Fe3t
and copper can form Cut and
Cu2+. (The most common transition metals with more than
one
valence
number are listed in Table 3.3.) The name of a
compound must identify
which ion is present in the compound. To do this, the element's name is
used, followed by the valence in parentheses, written in Roman numerals.
Therefore, Snt+ is tin(IV),
is iron(III), and Cu2+ is copper(II). This
naming method is called the Stock system after Alfred Stock, a German
chemist who first used it. Some examples of Stock system names are
listed in Table 3.6.

Unit 1
Matter and Chemical Bonding
goods
hypo
binary
Fe3+
Another Method for Naming Metals with Two Valences
In a method that
predates the Stock system, two different endings are
used to distinguish the valences of metals.
The
ending -ic is used to repre-
sent the larger valence number: The ending -ous is used to represent
the smaller valence number: Thus, the ions Sn2+t and Sn4+ are named
stannous ion and stannic ion_
To use this system, you need to know the
Latin name of an element: For example, the two ions of lead
are the
plumbous and plumbic ions. See Table 3.6 for more examples
This naming method has several drawbacks. Many metals have more
than two oxidation numbers. For
example, chromium can form three
different ions, and manganese can form five different ions.
Another draw-
back is that the name does not tell you what the valence of the metal is.
It only tells you that the valence is the smaller or larger of two.

Naming Compounds That Contain Hydrogen
If a binary compound contains hydrogen as the less electronegative
element,
hydrogen
is used first in the name of the compound. For
example, HCl is called hydrogen chloride and HzS is called hydrogen
sulfide. Sometimes hydrogen can be the anion, usually in a compound
that contains a Group 1 metal. If hydrogen is the anion, its ending must
be changed to -ide: For
example, NaH is called sodium hydride and LiH
is called lithium hydride. Hydrogen-containing compounds can also be
formed with the Group 15 elements.
These compounds are usually
referred to by their common names as
opposed to their IUPAC names. For
example, NHz is called ammonia, PH3 is called phosphine, AsHz is called
arsine, and SbH; is called stibine.
compounds that contain hydrogen are also acids. For example
H2SO4, hydrogen sulfate, is also called sulfuric acid. You will learn about
acid nomenclature in Chapter 10.

Naming Compounds That Contain Polyatomic Ions
Many compounds contain one Or more polyatomic ions. Often these
compounds contain three elements, in which case
are called
tertiary
compounds. Although
are not
binary compounds,
still contain
one type of anion and one type of cation.
The same naming rules that
apply to binary compounds apply to these compounds a8 well. For
example, NHCl is called ammonium chloride. NazSO4 is called sodium
sulfate. NiSO4 is called nickel(II) sulfate. NHANO3 is called ammonium
nitrate.
The non-metals in the periodic table are greatly outnumbered by the
metals.
There are
many negatively charged polyatomic ions, however;
to make up for this. In fact, polyatomic anions are commonly found in
everyday chemicals. Refer back to Table 3.4 for the names of the most
common polyatomic anions.
When you are
learning the names of polyatomic ions, you will notice
a
pattern. For example, consider the polyatomic ions that contain chlorine
and oxygen:
ClO
hypochlorite
C1Oz
chlorite
ClO:
chlorate
C1O4
perchlorate
Can you see the
pattern? Each ion has the same valence, but different
numbers of oxygen atoms
The base ion is the one with the
ate"
ending
chlorate. It contains three oxygen atoms. When the ending is changed
to "ite,
subtract an oxygen atom from the chlorate ion. The resulting
chlorite ion contains two oxygen atoms. Add "hypo'
to "chlorite,
and
subtract one more oxygen atom
The resulting hypochlorite ion has one

The base "ate

ions do not always have three oxygen atoms like
chlorate does. Consider the polyatomic ions that contain sulfur and
2
oxygen. In this case, the base ion, sulfate, SO4
contains four oxygen
atoms. The sulfite ion, SO32
therefore contains three oxygen atoms.
The hyposulfite ion, SO22
contains two oxygen atoms. Once you know
the meanings of the prefixes and suffixes, you need only memorize the
formulas of the
ate
ions. You can work out the formulas for the related
ions using their prefixes and suffixes. The meanings of the prefixes and
suffixes are summarized in Table 3.7. In this table, the

Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations
More
complex chemical equations than the ones you have already tried
can be balanced by
a
combination of inspection and trial and error
Here, however; are some steps to follow.
Step 1
Write out the skeleton equation. Ensure that you have
all the chemical formulas correctly:
Step 2  Begin by balancing the atoms that occur in the largest number
on either side of the
equation. Leave hydrogen, oxygen, and
other elements until later:
Step 3
Balance any polyatomic ions, such as sulfate, SO42
that occur
on both sides of the chemical equation as an ion unit: That is,
do not split a sulfate ion into 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygen
atoms. Balance this ion as one unit.
Step 4
Next; balance any hydrogen Or oxygen atoms that occur in &
combined and uncombined state. For example, combined
oxygen might be in the form of COz, while uncombined
oxygen occurs a8 02-

Combustion reactions form an important class of chemical reactions.
The combustion of fuel-

throughout history, heated and lit our homes and cooked our food.
The energy produced by combustion reactions moves our airplanes,
trains, trucks, and cars.
A complete combustion reaction is the reaction of a compound 0r
element with 02 to form the most common oxides of the elements that
make up the compound. For example, a carbon-containing compound
undergoes combustion to form carbon dioxide, COz.
A sulfur-contain-
compound reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide, SOz.
Combustion reactions are usually accompanied by the production
of light and heat: In the case of carbon-containing compounds,
complete combustion results in the formation of, among other
carbon dioxide. For
example, methane, CH4, the primary constituent
of natural gas, undergoes complete combustion to form carbon dioxide,
(the most common oxide of carbon), as well as water: This combustion

In this section, you learned about three major types of reactions: synthe-
sis, decomposition, and combustion reactions. Using your knowledge
about these types of reactions, you learned how to predict the products
of various reactants. In section 5.3, you will increase your
understanding
of chemical reactions even further; learning about two major types of
chemical reactions.

Double Displacement Reactions
A
double displacement reaction involves the exchange of cations between
two ionic
compounds, usually in aqueous (water) solution. A double
displacement reaction is also known as
a double
replacement reaction.
A
general equation for a double displacement reaction is:
AB + CD
CB + AD
In this equation, A and C are cations and B and D are anions.
Consider the following situation. You have two unlabelled beakers.
One contains distilled water; and the other contains salt water. The two
samples look virtually identical. How can you quickly determine which
is the salt water without tasting them? (You should never taste anything
in a
chemistry laboratory:)
common test for the presence of chloride ions in water is the
addition of a few drops of silver nitrate solution.
The formation of a
white solid indicates the presence of chloride ions, as you can see in
Figure 4.14.
A double displacement reaction has occurred: That is, the cations
in the reactants have essentially changed places. This switch is
modelled in Figure 4.15.

Sodium chloride and silver nitrate form ions in solution: When silver ions

form a solid.
Since silver chloride is virtually insoluble in water, it forms a solid
compound, O precipitate.
Double displacement reactions tend to occur in aqueous solution. Not
all ionic compounds, however; will react with one another in this way
You can tell that a double displacement reaction has taken
in the
following cases:
a solid (precipitate) forms
a gas is
produced
some double displacement reactions also form a molecular compound,
such as water: It is hard to tell when water is formed, because often the
reaction takes place in water:
Double Displacement Reactions that Form a Precipitate
A
precipitate is a solid that separates from a solution as the result of a
chemical reaction.
You will learn more about precipitates in Chapter 9.
Many double displacement reactions involve the formation of a precipitate:

You should think about two questions when analyzing a double
displacement reaction.
1
How do we determine the products?
2
Which of the
products -_~if any
will precipitate out of solution?
Barium chloride solution contains Ba2+ ions and Cl
ions. Potassium
sulfate solution contains K+ and S042- ions. When
are mixed, the
Baz+ ions come in contact with S042-
Because barium sulfate is
insoluble, the product comes out of solution as a solid. The Kt ions and
Cl- ions also come into contact with each other; but potassium chloride is
soluble, so these ions stay in solution:
How do you know that the precipitate is BaSO4 and not KCl? More
generally, how can you predict whether a precipitate will be formed in a
double displacement reaction? In this chapter; you will be given informa-
tion on
solubility
as you need it. You will learn more about how to
predict whether a compound is soluble o not in Chapter 9. Barium
sulfate, BaSO4 is not soluble in water; while potassium chloride, KCL,
is. Therefore, a reaction will take place and barium sulfate will be the
precipitate.
In
summary; to determine the products and their physical states in a
66
double displacement reaction, you must first
deconstruct" the reactants.

Then switch the cations, and
reconstruct
the products using proper
chemical formulas. You should then balance the chemical equation. You
will be given information to determine which of the products, if any, will
form a precipitate. Finally, you can write the physical state
(s) or (aq)

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Gas
In certain cases, you know that a double displacement reaction has
occurred because a gas is produced The gas is formed when one of the
products of the double displacement reaction decomposes to give water
and a gas.
Consider the reaction of aqueous sodium carbonate (washing soda)
and hydrochloric acid, shown in Figure 4.17. Hydrochloric acid is sold at
the hardware store under the common name "muriatic acid.
If you carry
out this reaction, you immediately see the formation of carbon dioxide
gas.

Types of Radioactive Decay and Balancing Nuclear Equations
There are three main types of radioactive decay: alpha particle emission,
beta particle emission, and the emission of gamma radiation. When an
unstable isotope undergoes radioactive decay it produces one O more dif:
ferent isotopes.
We represent radioactive decay using a nuclear equation.
Two rules for balancing nuclear equations are given below

help of the philosopher's stone: They believed that
elements were forever fixed and unchangeable.
Then Harriet Brooks arrived on the scene_
When she joined Rutherford's team, she was
asked to measure the atomic mass of the isotopes
that make up the mysterious vapour given off by
radium. She determined that its atomic mass was
between 40 and 100, whereas radium was known
to have an atomic mass of over 140. Surely this

Gamma Radiation
Gamma (Y) radiation is high energy electromagnetic radiation. It often
accompanies either alpha or beta particle emission.
Since gamma
radiation has neither mass nor
charge, it is represented as Bv, o simply %

processes do not involve the atom's electrons,

chemical environment of the nucleus For example, radioactive hydrogen-

A
summary of alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma emission
Many chemical reactions, once begun, can be stopped. For example,
a
combustion reaction, such as
a
fire, can be extinguished before it burns
itself out: Nuclear decay processes, on the other hand, cannot be stopped.
The principles of balancing nuclear equations apply to all nuclear
reactions. Nuclear fission occurs when a
highly unstable isotope splits
into smaller particles. Nuclear fission usually has to be induced in a
particle accelerator: Here, an atom can absorb a stream of high-energy
particles such as neutrons, &n_
This will cause the atom to
into
smaller fragments.
For
example, when uranium-235 absorbs a high energy neutron, Jn, it
breaks up, or
undergoes fission as follows:
92
+
8n
35
+
33n
How would you identify the missing particle? Notice that three neutrons,
8n, have a
mass number of 3 and a total atomic number of 0.
The total
atomic mass on the left side is (235 + 1) = 236 .
On the right we have
(87 + 3(1)) = 90 , and s0 (236
5
90) = 146 remains. The
missing particle
must have a mass number of 146.
The total atomic number on the left is 92.
The total atomic number
on the right, not
including the missing particle, is 35. This means that
(92
S
35) = 57 is the atomic number of the
missing particle. From the
periodic table, atomic number 57 corresponds to
lanthanum.

particle. The reaction that takes place in a hydrogen bomb is a fusion
reaction, as are the reactions that take place within the Sun, shown in
Figure 4.21. Fusion reactions require very high temperatures to proceed

but produce enormous amounts of energy: The fusion reaction that takes
place in a hydrogen bomb is represented by the following equation:

Section Wrap-Up
In this
chapter; you learned how atoms can interact with each other and
how unstable isotopes behave. In the first three sections, you learned
about chemical reactions In section 4.4, you learned about different types
of nuclear reactions: reactions in which atoms of one element change into
atoms of another element: In Unit 2, you will learn how stable isotopes
contribute to an indirect
counting method for atoms and molecules.

Nuclear reactors have
complex cooling systems that absorb the
heat given off by the fission reaction. The absorbed heat is
to
produce steam to drive a generator; thus producing electrical energy
Cooling the steam for re-use requires a large amount of cool water;
which is usually obtained from a nearby river o lake.
A
large amount
of hot water is then released into the river or lake. Do you think this is
a
form of pollution? What kinds of problems might warm
water cause?
KIU
Alpha or beta particle emission from a radioactive nucleus is
often, but not always, accompanied by gamma rays. Why does the
presence of gamma rays not affect how a nuclear equation of this type
is balanced?

following statements. Classify the reactions.

Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses

Usually, not all the atoms in an element have the same mass.
As you
learned in Chapter 2, atoms of the same element that contain different
numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up of
two or more
isotopes. Chemists need to account for the presence of iso-
topes when finding the relationship between the mass of a
number
of atoms and the mass of a single atom.
To understand why this is impor-
tant, consider the following analogy
Imagine that you have the task of finding the total mass of 10 000
spoons. If you know the mass of a dessertspoon, can you assume that its
mass
represents the average mass of all the spoons? What if the 10 000
spoons include soupspoons, dessertspoons, and tablespoons? If you use
the mass of a
dessertspoon to calculate the total mass of all the spoons,
you may obtain a reasonable estimate.
Your answer will not be accurate,
however; because each type of spoon has & different mass

Mg(OH)2 , it is always made up of these three isotopes in the same

Average Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table
The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses
of all the element's isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of each
isotope within the element The average atomic mass is the mass that is
given for each element in the periodic table.
It is important to interpret averages carefully For example, in 1996,
the average size of a Canadian family was 3.1. Of course, no one family
actually has 3.1 people. In the same way; while the average atomic mass
of carbon is 12.01 U, no one atom of carbon has a mass of 12.01
u_
Examine Figure 5.3. Since the atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12,
why does the periodic table show a value of 12.01 ., instead of exactly
12 u? Carbon is made up of several isotopes, not just carbon-12. Naturally
occurring carbon contains carbon-12 , carbon-13, and carbon-14. If all
these isotopes were present in equal amounts, you could simply find
the average of the masses of the isotopes. This average mass would be
about 13 u, since the masses of carbon-13 and carbon-14 are about 13
U
and 14 u
respectively.
The
isotopes, though, are not present in equal amounts. Carbon-12
comprises 98.9% of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for 1.1%_
Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount-~about 1 x 10-10%. It makes
sense that the average mass of all the
isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u--very
close to 12__since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.

The atomic mass that is given in the periodic table represents the average

How
moles of acetic acid, CH:COOH, are in a 23.6 g sample?
What Is Required?
You need to find the number of moles in 23.6 g of acetic acid.
What Is Given?
You are given the mass of the
sample.
Plan Your Strategy
To obtain the number of moles of acetic acid, divide the mass of
acetic acid by its molar mass.
Act on Your Strategy
The molar mass of CH:COOH is
(12.01 x 2) + (16.00 X 2) + (1.01 X 4) = 60.06 g.
m
n =
MCH,COOH

)
0.393 mol
Therefore there are 0.393 mol of acetic acid in 23.6 g of acetic acid.
Check Your Solution
Work backwards. There are 60.06 g in each mol of acetic acid. So in
0.393 mol of acetic acid, you have 0.393 mol X 60.06 g/mol = 23.6 g
of acetic acid. This value matches the question.

Calculating Percentage Composition from a Chemical Formula
In the previous Practice Problems, you used mass data to calculate
percentage composition. This skill is useful for interpreting experimental
data when the chemical formula is unknown. Often, however; the
percentage composition is calculated from a known chemical formula.
This is useful when you are interested in extracting a certain element
from a
compound: For example, many metals, such as iron and mercury,
exist in mineral form. Mercury is most often found in nature a8
mercury(II) sulfide, HgS. Knowing the percentage composition of HgS
helps a metallurgist predict the mass of mercury that can be extracted
from a sample of HgS.
When determining the percentage composition by mass of a
homogeneous sample, the size of the sample does not matter: According
to the law of definite proportions, there is a fixed proportion of each
element in the
compound,
no matter how much of the
compound you
have. This means that you can choose a convenient
sample size when
calculating percentage composition from a formula
If you assume that you have one mole of a
compound, you can use the
molar mass of the
compound, with its chemical formula, to calculate its
percentage composition: For example, suppose that you want to find the

simplify the calculation. To calculate an empirical formula successfully,
however; you should not round the numbers until you have

Determining the Empirical Formula by Experiment
In practice, you can determine a

its percentage composition. There are several different ways to do this.
One way is to use a
synthesis reaction in which a sample of an element
with a known mass reacts with another element to form a
compound
Since you know the mass of one of the elements and you can measure
the mass of the
compound produced, you can calculate the percentage
composition.
For
example; copper reacts with the oxygen in air to form the
green compound copper oxide. Many buildings in Canada, such as the
Parliament buildings in Ottawa, have green roofs that contain some
copper(II) oxide. (See Figure 6.7.) Imagine you have a 5.0 g sample of

A
large number of important chemicals are composed of hydrogen,

carbon, and oxygen:
The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer is a
useful instrument for analyzing these chemicals. It allows chemists to
determine the percentage composition of compounds that are made up
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The applications of this instrument
include forensic science, food chemistry, pharmaceuticals and academic
research _
anywhere that an unknown compound needs to be analyzed.
The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer works because we know
that
compounds containing carbon and hydrogen will burn in a stream of
pure oxygen, 02, to yield only carbon dioxide and water: If we can find
the mass of the carbon dioxide and water separately, we can determine
the mass percent of carbon and hydrogen in the compound.

bonded to each formula unit.
A chemist may know the formula of the
ionic part of the hydrate but not how many water molecules are present
for each formula unit.
Epsom salts, for example, consist of crystals of magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate, MgSO4 7HzO . Every formula unit of magnesium sulfate has

examples of hydrates are shown in Table 6.4.
Compounds that have no water molecules incorporated into them
are called anhydrous to distinguish them from their hydrated forms. For
example,
a chemist might refer to CaSO4 as anhydrous calcium sulfate.
This is because it is often found in hydrated form as calcium sulfate

Section Wrap-up
In section 6.4, you learned several practical methods for determining
empirical and molecular formulas of compounds. You may have noticed
that these methods work because compounds react in predictable ways.
For
example, you learned that & compound containing carbon and
hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. From
the mass of the products, you can determine the amount of carbon and
hydrogen in the reactant: You also learned that a hydrate decomposes
when it is heated to form water and an anhydrous compound. Again, the
mass of one of the
products of this reaction helps you identify the reactant
In Chapter 7, you will learn more about how to use the information from
chemical reactions in order to do quantitative calculations.

Mass Relationships in Chemical Equations
As you have learned, the coefficients in a balanced chemical equation rep-
resent moles as well as
particles. Therefore, you can use the molar masses
of reactants and products to determine the mass ratios for & reaction. For
example, consider the equation for the formation of ammonia:
+
You can find the mass of each substance using the equation m = M x n
CHEC KPCINI
as follows:
Refer back to Chapter 5.

In Table 7.1, you can see how particles, moles, and mass are related in a
chemical equation. Notice that the mass of the product is equal to the
total mass of the reactants_
This confirms the law of conservation of mass.

Stoichiometric Mass Calculations
You now know what a balanced chemical equation tells you in terms
of number of particles, number of moles, and mass of products and
reactants. How do you use this information? Because reactants and
products are related by a fixed ratio, if you know the number of moles
of one substance, the balanced equation tells you the number of moles
of all the other substances. In Chapters 5 and 6, you learned how to
convert between particles, moles, and mass. Therefore, if you know the
amount of one substance in a chemical reaction (in particles, moles, or
mass), you can calculate the amount of any other substance in the
reaction (in particles, moles, or mass),
the information in the
balanced chemical equation.
You can see that a balanced chemical equation is a
powerful tool. It
allows chemists to
predict the amount of products that will result from a

The concept of stoichiometry

He stated that "stoichiometry

the quantitative proportions or
mass ratios in which chemical

To determine how much lithium hydroxide is needed, engineers need to
ask and answer two important questions:
How much carbon dioxide is produced per astronaut each day?
How much lithium hydroxide is needed per kilogram of carbon
dioxide?
Engineers can answer the first question by experimenting: To answer the
second question,

A General Process for Solving Stoichiometric Problems
You have just solved several stoichiometric problems. In these problems,
masses of products and reactants were given, and masses were also
required for the answers. Chemists usually need to know what mass
of reactants
require and what mass of products
can expect:
Sometimes, however; a question requires you to work with the number
of moles O particles. Use the same process for solving stoichiometric
problems, whether you are working with mass, moles, Or particles:
Step 1

Step 2
If you are given the mass O number of particles of a substance,
convert it to the number of moles.
Step 3

calculations, you assumed that the reactants and products occurred in the

reactants are often not
present in these exact ratios. Similarly, the amount

Determining the Limiting Reactant
The reactant that is completely used up in a chemical reaction is called
the
limiting reactant: In other words, the limiting reactant determines
how much product is produced. When the limiting reactant is used up,
the reaction stops. In real-life situations, there is almost always a limiting
reactant:
A reactant that remains after a reaction is over is called the excess
reactant: Once the limiting reactant is used, no more product can be
made, regardless of how much of the excess reactants may be present

When you are given amounts of two O more reactants to solve a
stoichiometric problem, you first need to identify the limiting reactant:
One way to do this is to find out how much product would be produced
by each reactant if the other reactant were present in excess. The reactant
that
produces the least amount of product is the limiting reactant:
Examine the following Sample Problem

identify the limiting reactant:

Therefore, the limiting reactant is water: Notice that there is more
water than lithium nitride, in terms of mass and moles. Water is the
limiting reactant; however; because 3 mol of water are needed to
react with
1 mol of lithium nitride.
Check Your Solution
According to the balanced chemical equation, the ratio of lithium
nitride to water is 1/3. The ratio of lithium nitride to water; based
on the mole amounts calculated; is 0.14.0.32. Divide this ratio by
0.14 to
1.0.2.3. For each mole of lithium nitride, there are only
2.3 mol water: However; 3 mol are
required by stoichiometry
Therefore, water is the limiting reactant

Why Actual Yield and Theoretical Yield Are Often Different
The actual yield of chemical reactions is usually less than the theoretical
This is caused by a variety of factors For example, sometimes less
than perfect collection techniques contribute to a lower than expected
yield.
A reduced
yield may also be caused by a competing reaction: &
reaction that occurs at the same time as the principal reaction and
involves its reactants and/or products For example, phosphorus reacts
with chlorine to form phosphorus trichloride. Some of the phosphorus
trichloride, however; can then react with chlorine to form phosphorus
pentachloride.

Therefore, not all the phosphorus is converted to phosphorus
trichloride.
So the actual yield of phosphorus trichloride is less than
the theoretical yield.
Experimental design and technique may affect the actual yield, as
well: For
example, suppose that you need to obtain & product by filtration.
Some of the product may remain in solution and therefore not be caught
on the filter paper:
Another common cause of reduced
yield is impure reactants. The
theoretical yield is calculated based on the assumption that reactants are
pure.
You will learn about the effects of impure reactants on page 265.
Calculating Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of a chemical reaction compares the mass of product
obtained by experiment (the actual yield) with the mass of product
determined by stoichiometric calculations (the theoretical yield) It is
calculated as follows:

When ammonia is produced industrially, how-
ever; temperature and pressure are manipulated to maximize the speed

Applications of Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of chemical reactions is extremely important in
industrial chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry; For example; the
synthesis of certain drugs involves many sequential chemical reactions.
Often each reaction has a low percentage

overall yield. Research chemists, who generally work with small quanti-
ties of reactants, may be satisfied with a poor

may use hun-
dreds or even thousands of
kilograms of reactants! A difference of 1%
in the yield of a reaction can translate into thousands of dollars.
The work of a chemist in a laboratory can be likened to making
spaghetti for a family: The work of a chemical engineer; by contrast, is like
making spaghetti for 10 000 people! Learn more about chemical engineers

Solubility and Saturation
The ability of a solvent to dissolve a solute depends on the forces of
attraction between the particles. There is always some attraction between
solvent and solute particles, so some solute always dissolves. The
solubility of a solute is the amount of solute that dissolves in a given
quantity of solvent, at a certain temperature. For
example, the solubility of sodium chloride in water
at 20C is 36 g per 100 mL of water:
A
saturated solution is formed when no more
solute will dissolve in a solution, and excess solute is
present; For example, 100 mL of a saturated solution
of table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water at 208C
contains 36 g of sodium chloride.
The solution is
saturated with respect to sodium chloride. If more
sodium chloride is added to the solution, it will not
dissolve. The solution may still be able to dissolve
other solutes, however
An unsaturated solution is a solution that is not
saturated. Therefore, it can dissolve more solute.
For
example,
a
solution that contains 20 g of sodium
chloride dissolved in 100 mL of water at 20*C is unsat-
urated. This solution has the potential to dissolve
another 16 g f salt, as Figure 8.4 demonstrates.

however; will take a long time to dissolve. Why?
Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving
You may have observed that a solute, such as sugar, dissolves faster in
hot water than in cold water: In fact, for most solid solutes, the rate of
dissolving is greater at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, the
solvent molecules have greater kinetic energy Thus,
collide with the
undissolved solid molecules more frequently. This increases their rate of
dissolving:
Suppose that

coffee. How can you make the sugar dissolve even faster? You can stir
the coffee_
Agitating 4 mixture by stirring or by shaking the container
increases the rate of dissolving: Agitation brings fresh solvent into contact
with undissolved solid.
Finally, you may have noticed that a large lump of solid sugar
dissolves more slowly than an equal mass of powdered sugar: Decreasing
the size of the particles increases the rate of dissolving: When you break

strength of each attraction influences the solubility, o the amount of a
solute that dissolves in a solvent.
To make this easier to understand, consider the following three steps
in the process of dissolving a solid in a liquid,
The Process of Dissolving at the Molecular Level
1
The forces between the particles in the solid must be broken.
This step always requires energy. In an ionic solid, the forces
that are
holding the ions together must be broken. In a molecu-
lar solid, the forces between the molecules must be broken.
Step 2
Some of the intermolecular forces between the particles in the
liquid must be broken. This
also
requires energy
Step 3
There is an attraction between the
particles of the solid and the
particles of the liquid, This step always gives off energy
The solid is more likely to dissolve in the liquid if the energy change in
3 is
greater than the sum of the energy changes in steps 1 and 2_
(You will learn more about energy and dissolving in Unit 5.)
Polar and Non-Polar Substances
In the Thought Lab in section 8.1, you observed that solid iodine is
insoluble in water: Only a
weak attraction exists between the non-polar
iodine molecules and the

Ion-Dipole Attractions
Ionic crystals consist of repeating patterns of oppositely charged ions, as
shown in Figure 8.9.
What happens when an ionic compound comes in
contact with water? The negative end of the dipole on some water mole-
cules attracts the cations on the surface of the ionic crystal. At the same
time, the positive end of the water dipole attracts the anions. These attrac-
tions are known as ion-dipole attractions: attractive forces between an ion
and a
molecule. If ion-dipole attractions can
replace the ionic bonds
between the cations and anions in an ionic compound, the compound
will dissolve. Generally an ionic compound will dissolve in @

An Exception: Insoluble Ionic Compounds
Although most ionic compounds are soluble in water; some are not very
soluble at all. The attraction between ions is difficult to break:
As a result,
compounds with very strong ionic bonds, such as silver chloride, tend to
be less soluble in water than compounds with weak ionic bonds, such as
sodium chloride.
Predicting Solubility
You can
predict the solubility of a binary compound, such as mercury(II)
sulfide, HgS, by comparing the electronegativity of each element in the
compound. If there is a
difference in the two electronegativities, the
bond between the elements is
Or even ionic. This type of
compound
probably dissolves in water: If there is only a small difference in the two
electronegativities, the bond is not
Or ionic.
This type of compound
probably does not dissolve in water: For
example, the electronegativity of
mercury is 1.9. The electronegativity of sulfur is 2.5.
The difference in
these two
electronegativities is small, only 0.6. Therefore, you can predict
that mercury(II) sulfide is insoluble in water: In Chapter 9, you will learn
another way to
predict the solubility of ionic compounds in water:

Factors That Affect Solubility
You have taken a close look at the attractive forces between solute and
solvent particles Now that you understand
solutes dissolve, it is
time to examine the three factors that affect solubility: molecule size,
temperature, and pressure. Notice that these three factors are similar to
the factors that affect the rate of
dissolving: Be careful not to confuse them.
Molecule Size and Solubility
Small molecules are often more soluble than larger molecules. Methanol,
CH:OH, and ethanol, CH:CHzOH,
are both completely miscible with
water: These compounds have OH groups that form hydrogen bonds with
water: Larger molecules with the same OH group but more carbon atoms,
such as
pentanol, CH:CHzCHzCHzCHzOH ,
are far less soluble.
All three
compounds form hydrogen bonds with water; but the larger pentanol
is less
overall, making it less soluble. Table 8.2 compares five
molecules by size and solubility:

Heat Pollution:
A
Solubility Problem
For most solids, and almost all ionic substances, solubility increases as
the temperature of the solution increases. Gases, on the other hand,
always become less soluble as the temperature increases. This is why a
refrigerated soft drink tastes fizzier than the same drink at room tempera-
ture. The warmer drink contains less dissolved carbon dioxide than the
cooler drink:
This property of gases makes heat pollution & serious problem:
industries and power plants use water to cool down overheated machin-

heat from the water; however; increases the temperature of the body of
water: As the temperature increases, the dissolved oxygen in the water
decreases. Fish and other aquatic wildlife and plants may not have
enough oxygen to breathe.
The natural heating of water in rivers and lakes can pose problems,
too. Fish in warmer lakes and rivers are particularly vulnerable in the

Pressure and Solubility
The final factor that affects solubility is pressure. Changes in pressure
have
any effect on solid and liquid solutions. Such changes do
affect the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent, however: The solubility of
the gas is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the liquid.
For
example, the solubility of oxygen in lake water depends on the air
pressure above the lake.
When you open a carbonated drink, you can observe the effect of pres-
sure on
solubility Figure 8.13 shows this effect: Inside a soft drink bottle,
the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas is very high: about 400 kPa: When
you open the bottle, you hear the sound of escaping gas as the pressure is
reduced. Carbon dioxide gas escapes quickly from the bottle, since the
pressure of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is much lower: only
about 0.03 kPa: The solubility of the carbon dioxide in the liquid soft
drink decreases greatly. Bubbles begin to rise in the liquid as gas comes
out of solution and escapes. It takes a while for all the gas to leave the
solution, s0 you have time to enjoy the taste of the soft drink before it

Phenol is a hazardous liquid, especially when it is at room temperature.
It is a volatile chemical.
Inhaling phenol adversely affects the central
nervous
system, and can lead to a coma. Inhalation is not the only danger:
Coma and death have been known to OCcUT within 10 min after phenol has
contacted the skin. Also, as little as 1 g of phenol can be fatal if swallowed.
Would you expect to find such a hazardous chemical in over-the-
counter medications? Check your medicine cabinet at home. You may
find phenol listed as an ingredient in throat sprays and in lotions to
relieve itching:
You may also find it used as an antiseptic O disinfectant.
Is
phenol
a hazard or a beneficial
ingredient in many medicines? This
depends entirely on concentration: the amount of solute per quantity of
solvent: At high concentrations, phenol can kill. At low concentrations,
it is & safe component of certain medicines.
Modern analytical tests allow chemists to detect and measure almost
any chemical at extremely low concentrations. In this section, you will
learn about various ways that chemists use to express the concentration
of a solution:
As well, you will find the concentration of a solution by
experiment
Concentration as a MassMolume Percent
Recall that the solubility of a compound at a certain temperature is often
expressed as the mass of the solute per 100 mL of solvent: For example,
you know that the solubility of sodium chloride is 36 g/100 mL of water at
room
temperature.
The final volume of the sodium chloride solution may
Or may not be 100 mL. It is the volume of the solvent that is important
Chemists often express the concentration of an unsaturated solution
as the mass of solute dissolved per volume of the solution.
This is differ-
ent from solubility It is usually expressed as a percent relationship. A
massIvolume percent gives the mass of solute dissolved in a volume of
solution, expressed as a percent: The mass/volume percent is also referred
to as the percent (m/v).

Molar Concentration
The most useful unit of concentration in chemistry is molar concentra-
tion. Molar concentration is the number of moles of solute in
1 L of
solution. Notice that the volume of the solution in litres is used, rather
than the volume of the solvent in millilitres. Molar concentration is also
known as
molarity.
Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L) =
Volume of solution (in L)
This formula can be shortened to give

Molar concentration is particularly useful to chemists because it is related
to the number of
particles in a solution.
None of the other measures of
concentration are related to the number of particles. If you are given the
molar concentration and the volume of a solution, you can calculate the
amount of dissolved solute in moles. This allows you to solve

Using Molar Concentration to Find Mass_
Problem
At 20'C, a saturated solution of calcium sulfate, CaSO4, has a
concentration of 0.0153 mol/L:
A student takes 65 mL of this
solution and evaporates it. What mass (in g) is left in the
evaporating dish?
What Is Required?
You need to find the mass (in g) of the solute, calcium sulfate
What Is Given?
The molar concentration is 0.0153 mol/L. The volume of the
solution is 65 mL-
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1
Convert the volume from mL to L using the formula
1.000 L
Volume (in L) = Volume (in mL) x
1000
Step 2  Rearrange the following formula to solve for the amount
of solute (in mol):
Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L) =
Volume of solution (in L)
Step 3
Determine the molar mass of calcium sulfate. Use the molar
mass to find the mass in grams, using the formula below:
Mass (in g) of CaSO
=
Amount (in mol) x Molar mass of CaSO4 (in glmol)
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1
Convert the volume from mL to L;
1.000 L
Volume = 65 mL X
1000 mL
=
0.065 L
Step 2   Rearrange the formula to solve for the amount of solute.

Amount of solute = Molar concentration X Volume of solution

Step 3
Determine the molar mass_
Then find the mass in grams.
Molar mass of CaSO4 = 40.08 + 32.07 + (4 X 16.00)

Calculate the volume of the original concentrated solution

The units are correct. The final solution must be much less

The Effect of Ion Size on Solubility
When an atom gives up O1
an electron, the size of the ion that results
is different from the size of the original atom: In Figure 9.24, for example,
can see that the sodium ion is smaller than the sodium atom
In
general, the ions of metals tend to be smaller than their corresponding
neutral atoms. For the ions of non-metals, the reverse is true. The ions of
non-metals tend to be larger than their corresponding neutral atoms.
Small ions bond more closely together than
ions. Thus, the bond
between small ions is stronger than the bond between
ions with
the same
charge.
As a result,
compounds with small ions tend to be less
soluble than compounds with large ions Consider the ions of elements
from Group 17 (VIIA), for example. Recall, from Chapters 2 and 3, that the
size of the ions increases a8 you go down a family in the periodic table:

Soluble or Insoluble: General Solubility Guidelines
As you have seen, nearly all salts that contain the ammonium ion or an
alkali metal are soluble. This observed pattern does not tell you how solu-
ble these salts are, however:
As well, it does not tell you whether ammo-
nium chloride is more or less soluble than sodium chloride. Chemists rely
on
published data for this information. (See Figure 9.3.)

and physical data for tens of

resources, such as The CRC
Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics, provide these data
as well:
Many factors affect solubility Thus, predicting solubility is neither
straightforward nor simple. Nevertheless, the general solubility guidelines
in Table 9.1 are a useful summary of ionic-compound interactions with
water: To
use Table 9.1, remember that a higher
guideline number always
takes precedence over a lower guideline number: For example, barium
chloride, BaClz, is & white crystalline powder: The barium ion, Ba2t
is
listed in guideline 4 as insoluble. The chloride ion, Cl-, is listed in
guideline 3 as soluble
The higher guideline number takes precedence.
Thus, you would predict that barium chloride is soluble:

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Precipitate
A
double displacement reaction that results in the formation of an insolu-
ble substance is often called a precipitation reaction. Figure 9.4 is a clear
example of a precipitation reaction. What if you did not have this
graph, however; and you were unable to do an
experiment? Could you
have
predicted that mixing Pb(NOs)aq) and 2KIaq) would result in an
insoluble compound? Yes. When you are given (on paper) a
of solu-
tions to be mixed together; start by thinking about the exchange of ions
that may occur: Then use the general
solubility guidelines (Table 9.1) to
predict which compounds, if any, are insoluble.
For example, consider lead(II) nitrate, Pb(NO3)z, and potassium
iodide, KI: Lead(II) nitrate contains Pb2+ cations and NO:
anions.
Potassium iodide contains Kt cations and I  anions. Exchanging positive
ions results in lead(II) iodide, Pblz, and potassium nitrate, KNO3_
From
the solubility guidelines, you know that all potassium salts and nitrates
are soluble. Thus, potassium nitrate is soluble. The Pb2+ ion is listed in
guideline 2 as an insoluble cation. The I- ion is listed in
guideline 3
as
a
soluble anion. Remember that a higher guideline number takes prece-
dence over a lower
guideline number: Thus, you can predict that lead(I)
iodide is insoluble It will form a precipitate when the solutions are

Representing Aqueous Ionic Reactions with Net lonic Equations
Mixing a solution that contains silver ions with a solution that contains
chloride ions produces a white precipitate of silver chloride. There must
have been other ions present in each solution, as well: You know this
because it is impossible to have a solution of just a cation or just an anion.
Perhaps the solution that contained silver ions was prepared using silver
nitrate O silver acetate. Similarly, the solution that contained chloride
ions might have been prepared by dissolving NaCl in water; O perhaps
NHACl or another soluble chloride.

will react with any other solution that contains Cl-(aq) to form a
precipitate of AgCl(s): The other ions in the solutions are not important
to the net result: These ions are like passive onlookers.
are called
spectator ions.
The reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride can be
represented by the following chemical equation:
AgNO3laq)
+
NaClaq)
NaNOalaq)
+
AgCl(s)
This equation does not show the change that occurs, however: It shows
the reactants and
products as intact compounds. In reality, soluble ionic
compounds dissociate into their respective ions in solution. So chemists
often use a total ionic
equation to show the dissociated ions of the soluble
ionic compounds.
Agt(aq) + NO3 (aq) + Nat(aq) + Cl-(aq)
Nat(aq) + NOz (aq) + AgCl(s)
Notice that the precipitate, AgCl, is still written a8 an ionic formula. This
makes sense because precipitates are insoluble, so
do not dissociate
into ions.
Also notice that the
spectator ions appear on both sides of the
equation. Here is the total ionic equation again, with slashes through the
spectator ions.
Agt(aq) +

4.
Since covalent compounds do not produce ions in aqueous solution,
write their molecular formulas. Water is a common
example,
because it dissociates only very slightly into ions.
When a reaction
involves a gas,
always include the gas in the net ionic equation.
5.
Write strong acids (discussed in the next chapter) in their ionic
form. There are six strong acids:
hydrochloric acid (write as Ht(aq) and Cl-(aq) not HCl(aq))
hydrobromic acid (write as Httaq) and Br (aq))
hydroiodic acid (write as Htlaq) and 1-(aq))
sulfuric acid (write as Htlaq) and SO4(aq))
nitric acid (write as Htlaq) and NOz"(aq))
perchloric acid (write as Htraq) and CIO4 (aq))
All other acids are weak and form few ions. Therefore, write them
in their molecular form.

Finally, check that the net ionic equation is balanced for charges as
well as for atoms.

Identifying lons in Aqueous Solution
Suppose that you have a sample of water: You want to know what; if any,
ions are dissolved in it:
Today technological devices, such as the mass
spectrometer; make this investigative work fairly simple. Before such
devices, however; chemists relied on
wet chemical
techniques:
experimental tests, such as submitting a sample to a series of double
displacement reactions. Chemists still use wet chemical
techniques.
With each reaction, insoluble compounds precipitate out of the solution.
(See Figure 9.6.) This enables the chemist to determine, eventually, the
identity of one O several ions in the solution.
This ion-identification
process is an example of qualitative analysis.
Chemists use a range of
techniques for qualitative analysis. For exam-
the colour of an aqueous solution can help to identify one of the ions
that it contains. Examine Table 9.3. However; the intensity of ion colour
varies with its concentration in the solution:
Also
in mind that many
ions are colourless in aqueous solution. For example, the cations of ele-
ments from Groups 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA), as well as aluminum, zinc, and
most anions, are colourless.
So there are limits to the inferences you can
make if you rely on solution colour alone.
Another qualitative analysis technique is a flame test. A dissolved
ionic
compound is placed in a flame.
Table 9.4 lists the flame colours
associated with several ions. Notice that all the ions are metallic
The
flame test is only useful for identifying metallic ions in aqueous solution.
Qualitative analysis challenges a chemist's creative imagination and
chemical understanding: Discover this for yourself in Investigation 9-B.

Waste-Water Treatment
The treatment of waste water (sewage) is often divided into three types:
primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment (See Figure 9.11.)
Primary treatment mainly involves removing solids from waste water
physically,
filters and settling tanks
Secondary treatment involves
bacteria to chemically decompose
dissolved and suspended organic compounds
Tertiary treatment involves chemical treatments to remove the majority
of remaining ions and disease-causing micro-organisms

or farms for fertilizer
Primary Treatment
Screens remove larger solids.
As waste water slowly passes through a
tank, smaller particles (such as gravel, sand, and food wastes)
settle out:
In a sedimentation tank, finer-sized particles settle out slowly to form sludge.
Sludge, oils, and grease from the sedimentation tank move to a sludge-digesting tank. There they are
chemically decomposed ("digested") by anaerobic bacteria.
Secondary Treatment
5
Bacterial decomposition of dissolved organic matter takes place in trickling filter tanks and activated
sludge tanks.
Tertiary Treatment
The resulting waste water may be returned to waterways or used by industries or for irrigation. Processes
such as precipitation and filtration remove most remaining pollutants Treatment with chlorine or ozone
kills most of the disease-causing micro-organisms. The resulting water is safe for most purposes, but not
for drinking:

The Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases

acids and bases. When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water; for example,
it dissociates (breaks apart) into hydrogen
and chloride ions.

pattern was first noticed in the late nineteenth century by a Swedish

Limitations of the Arrhenius Theory
The Arrhenius theory is useful if you are interested in the ions that result
when an acid or a base dissociates in water: It also helps explain what
happens when
an
acid and
a
base undergo a neutralization reaction. In
such a reaction, an acid combines with a base to form an ionic compound

The net ionic equation for this reaction shows the principal ions in the
Arrhenius theory:

Since acids and bases produce hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, water
is an inevitable result of acid-base reactions.
Problems arise with the Arrhenius theory, however: One problem
involves the ion that is
responsible for acidity: Ht_

Notice that the water is unchanged when the reaction is represented
this way: However; you learned earlier that water is a
molecule.
The 0 atom has a
negative charge, and the H atoms have partial
positive charges. Thus, HzO must interact in some way with the ions Ht
and Cl-. In fact, chemists made a discovery in the early twentieth century:
realized that protons do not exist in isolation in aqueous solution.
(The hydrogen ion is simply a proton. It is a positively charged nuclear
particle ) Instead, protons are always hydrated:
are attached to
water molecules.
A
hydrated proton is called a hydronium ion, HsOtaq).

There is yet another problem with the Arrhenius theory. It is limited
to acid-base reactions in a single solvent, water: Many acid-base reactions
take place in other solvents, however:
The Bronsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases
In 1923, two chemists working independently of each other; proposed a
new
theory of acids and bases. (See Figure 10.4.) Johannes Bronsted in
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Thomas Lowry in London, England, proposed
what is called the Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases. This theory
overcame the
problems related to the Arrhenius theory
The Bronsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases

removed.
A base is & substance that can remove a

When hydrogen chloride molecules enter an aqueous solution, 100% of the
hydrogen chloride molecules dissociate. As a result; the solution contains the same per-
cent of H
ions (in the form of HzO+) and CIl
ions: 100%.
A
weak acid is an acid that dissociates very slightly in a water solu-
tion. Thus, only a small percentage of the acid molecules break apart into
ions.
Most of the acid molecules remain intact. For
example, acetic acid is
a
weak acid. On average, only about 1% (one in a hundred) of the acetic
acid molecules dissociate at any given moment in a 0.1 mol/L solution.
(The number of acid molecules that dissociate depends on the concentra-
tion and temperature of the solution.) In fact, the concentration of
hydronium ions in a solution of a weak acid is always less than the

When acetic acid molecules enter an aqueous solution, only about 1% of
them dissociate. Thus, the number of acetic acid molecules in solution is far greater than
the number of hydronium ions and acetate ions:

both directions, indicating that the reaction is reversible. In other words,
the products of the reaction also react to produce the original reactants. In
this reaction, molecules of acetic acid dissociate just as quickly and as
often as the dissociated ions re-associate to
produce acetic acid molecules
(Figure 10.8 will
visualize what happens.)
Most acids are weak acids. Whenever you see a reversible chemical

Thus, acids that contain two hydrogen ions dissociate to form two anions.
These acids are sometimes called diprotic acids. (The
di-, a8 you
know, means
'two") The acid that is formed by the first dissociation is
stronger than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation.
Acids that contain three hydrogen

called triprotic acids.
Phosphoric acid, HyPO4(ag), is a triprotic acid. It gives rise to three anions,

Here again, the acid that is formed by the first dissociation is stronger
than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation. This acid is
stronger than the acid that is formed by the third dissociation. Keep in
mind, however; that all three of these acids are weak because only a small
proportion of them dissociates.
Strong Bases and Weak Bases
Like a strong acid, a strong base dissociates completely into ions in water:

bases. The oxides and
hydroxides of the alkaline earth metals

Group 2

(IIA)-below beryllium are also strong bases.
Recall that the concentration of hydronium ions in a dilute solution of
calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2
a
strong acid is equal to the concentration of the acid. Similarly, the con-
strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2
centration of hydroxide ions in a dilute solution of a strong base is equal
barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2
to the concentration of the base. For
example,
a 1.0 mol/L solution of
sodium hydroxide (a strong base) contains 1.0 mol/L of hydroxide ions.
Table 10.5 lists some common strong bases. Barium hydroxide,
Ba(OH)z, and strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2 , are strong bases that are
soluble in water: Magnesium oxide, MgO, and magnesium hydroxide,
Mg(OH)2, are als0 strong bases, but
are considered to be insoluble.
A small amount of these
compounds does dissolve in water; however:
Virtually all of this small amount dissociates completely.
Most bases are weak: A
weak base dissociates very slightly in a
water solution_
The most common weak base is aqueous ammonia. In a
0.1 mol/L solution, only about 1% of the ammonia molecules react with
water to form hydroxide ions. This reversible reaction is represented in
Figure 10.9.

Ammonia does not contain hydroxide ions, so it is not an Arrhenius base:
As you can see, however; an ammonia molecule can remove a proton from water; leaving
a
hydroxide ion behind. Thus, ammonia is a Bronsted-Lowry weak base.

Describing Acid and Base Strength Quantitatively: pH

Advertisers talk about the
'pH balance
of products such as soaps, sham-
pOos, and skin creams. People who own aquariums and swimming
must monitor the pH of the water: (See Figure 10.10.) Gardeners and farm-
ers
use
simple tests to determine the pH of the soil:

and food crops grow best within a narrow range of pH. Similarly, the pH
of your blood must remain within narrow limits for you to stay healthy

Maintaining

measuring the pH of the water

pH is clearly related to health, and to the proper functioning of products
and systems. (Notice that the
'p" is always lower case, even at the start
of a sentence.) What exactly is
How is it measured? To answer these
questions, consider a familiar substance: water:
The Power of Hydrogen in Water
As you know, all aqueous solutions contain ions. Even pure water con-
tains a few ions that are
produced by the dissociation of water molecules.
Remember: The double arrow in the equation shows that the reaction is
reversible.
The ions recombine to form water molecules.

On average, at 25*C, only about two water molecules in a billion are
dissociated at any given moment. As you know, it is the ions in solution
that conduct electricity If there are virtually no ions, no electricity is
conducted: This is why pure water is such
a poor conductor: Chemists
have determined that the concentration of hydronium ions in neutral
water; at 25'C,is only 1.0 x 10-7 mol/L.
The dissociation of water also
produces the same, very small number of hydroxide ions Therefore, the
concentration of hydroxide ions is also 1.0 X
mol/L
Chemists sometimes use square brackets around a chemical formula.
This shorthand notation means
the concentration of" the chemical inside

'the concentration of hydro-
nium ions.
Thus, the concentration of hydronium ions and hydroxide
ions in neutral water can be written as

Compared with neutral water; acidic solutions contain a higher con-
centration of hydronium
Basic solutions contain a lower concentra-
tion of
hydronium ions. Therefore, the dissociation of water provides
another way of
thinking about acids and bases.
An acid is any compound
that increases [H3Ot] when it is dissolved in water:

that increases [OH-] when it is dissolved in water: (See Figure

The relationship between the concentrations of hydronium ions and
hydroxide ions in a solution determines whether the solution is acidic, basic, or neutral:
The pH Scale: Measuring by Powers of Ten
The concentration of hydronium ions ranges from about 10 mol/L for a
concentrated strong acid to about
mol/L for a
concentrated strong
base. This wide range of concentrations, and the negative powers of 10
are not very convenient to work with In 1909, a Danish biochemist; Soren
Sorensen, suggested a method for converting concentrations to positive
numbers. His method involved
the numerical system of logarithms.
The logarithm of a number is the power to which you must raise 10 to
equal that number: For
example, the logarithm of 10 is 1, because
101
=
10 .
The logarithm of 100 is 2, because 102 = 100 .
(See Appendix E
for more information about exponents and logarithms)
Sprensen defined pH as
[H+]. Since Sgrensen did not know about
hydronium ions, his definition of pH is based on Arrhenius' hydrogen
ion:
chemistry references reinterpret the H s0 that it refers to the
Bronsted-Lowry hydronium ion, HyOt, instead. This textbook adopts the
hydronium ion usage. Thus, the definition for
becomes

[HzO+] . Recall, though, that chemists use [Ht] as a shorthand
notation for [HsO+]. As a result; both equations give the same product.

The Chemistry of Oven Cleaning
Cleaners that contain sodium hydroxide and
potassium hydroxide are very effective
are also caustic and potentially very dangerous:
For example, sodium hydroxide, in the concen-
trations that are used in oven cleaners, can
irritate the skin and cause blindness if it
in the eyes As well, it is damaging to paints
and fabrics.
There are alternatives to sodium hydroxide
and other strong base cleaners. One alternative
involves using ammonia, NH3, which is a weak
base. If a bowl of dilute ammonia solution is
placed in an oven and left for several hours,
most of the grease and grime can be wiped off.
Ammonia does not completely ionize in
water: Only a small portion dissociates:
Although an ammonia solution is less caustic
than sodium hydroxide, it can be toxic if inhaled

Section Wrap-up
In this section, you considered the relationship among the strength of
acids and bases, the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions, and
pH. Much of the time, you examined acids and bases acting independent-
ly of each other: However; acids and bases often interact. In fact, acid-base
reactions have many important applications in the home, as well as in the
laboratory: In section 10.3, you will investigate acid-base reactions.

The balanced chemical equation shows that half the amount of sulfu-

concentration of sulfuric acid, however, is less than half the concen-
tration of potassium hydroxide. Therefore, the volume of sulfuric
acid should be greater than the volume of potassium hydroxide.

Section Wrap-up
In this section, as in much of Unit 3, you combined liquid solutes and
liquid solvents. You have learned how to describe the concentration of
ions that determine the acidic or basic nature of a solution.
As well, you
performed calculations to determine the concentration of acids and many
other substances in solution. In the upcoming unit, you will apply your
understanding of stoichiometry and solutions by examining the nature
and interactions of substances in the gaseous state.

The incompressibility of solids and liquids arises instead from the fact
that these particles cannot move independently of each other: That is,
the movement of one particle affects the movement of other particles,
Or is restricted by them.
This is especially true for solids. The particles of a solid are held
together in a framework, called a crystal lattice In a crystal lattice, the
positions of solid particles are relatively fixed. This explains

Another property of states of matter is their motion. According to the
particle theory, all particles that make up matter are in constant motion.
In solids, the range of motion of the particles is the most restricted. Each
particle of a solid is only able to vibrate around a fixed
in the lattice
(see Figure 11.2). This is called vibrational motion. Since solid particles
are fixed in space, the degree of disorder is very low
Particles in the liquid state can move more freely than particles in the
solid state, although not entirely independently Liquid particles move
with rotational motion as well as vibrational motion:
This means that the

The Gas State
Unlike solids and liquids, particles in the gaseous state are able to move
independently of one another Gas particles are able to move from one
in space to another: This is called translational motion. Thus, gas
particles move with all three types of motion: vibrational, rotational,
and translational. Gas particles move through space in random fashion.
However,
do travel in straight lines until their course is altered by
collisions with other particles. Because gas particles move freely, there is
a
high degree of disorder in a gaseous state.
Gas particles move much faster than liquid particles. Liquids

because
are still greatly influenced by
gravity Because gas particles move s0 quickly, gravity does not affect
them as much: Gases flow in all directions, including upward
gravity, until all of the available empty space is occupied: This is why
gases expand to fill a container: (See Figure 11.4.)
Gases can be compressed, unlike both solids and liquids. What is
different about their particle arrangement that allows for this? The space
between gas particles is much larger than the space between liquid or
solid particles. Even if gas particles are moved closer together through
compression, the distance between each particle is still very large. The
particles remain in the gaseous state: When gas molecules are compressed
further; eventually the forces between molecules become strong enough to
hold the gas molecules together At this point, the gas changes to the

You have examined some properties of solids, liquids, and gases.
You
have seen how the motion of the particles affects these properties. Now
you will examine how the particles affect each other:
The
particle theory states that there are attractive forces between
particles. The weaker the attractive force is between particles, the freer the
particles are to move. Therefore, attractive forces between particles are at
their strongest in the solid state.
Attractive forces are at their weakest in
the gaseous state.
The strength of attractive forces between particles in any physical
state depends on two major factors: type of force and temperature. The
effect of temperature, or kinetic energy, on the state of a substance will be
covered in greater detail later on in this section.
Attractions Between Charged Particles
What types of attractive forces exist between particles? In Chapter 3, you
learned that oppositely charged particles attract each other due to electro-
static attraction. Ionic
bonding is one example of electrostatic attraction:
A
positive ion (an atom Or molecule that has lost electrons) is attracted to
a
negative ion (an atom Or molecule that has gained electrons). Ions form
very strong ionic bonds. Since these attractive forces are $0 strong, ionic
compounds usually exist in nature as solids. For
example, table salt
(sodium chloride, NaCl) is & solid crystalline substance. It has a high
melting
and a high boiling

Attractions Between Polar Molecules
Not all particles are charged, but attractions can still form between them.
What is a dipole? Go back to
Chapter 3 or Chapter 8 to
You learned about intermolecular forces in Chapter 3. Intermolecular
refresh your memory:
forces are forces that exist between neutral molecules, or between
molecules and ions.
You know that some molecules are
due to their asymmetrical
shapes. Sulfur dioxide (S02) is one example of a
molecule.
These
molecules have a permanent dipole effect: This means that one end of
the molecule is more
positive, and the other end is more negative.
Polar molecules attract ions and other
molecules.
The partially positive end of one molecule is attracted to
the partially negative end of another molecule.
This
pattern
continues throughout the substance. These dipole-dipole
forces of attraction are not a8 strong as ionic bonds. Thus sub-
stances made up of
molecules can exist as

When a solid is heated, it gains kinetic energy
Eventually it will melt, and become a liquid.
When you add kinetic
energy by heating a liquid, it will boil and become a gas. Earlier in this
section, you learned that gases move much more quickly than liquids O
solids. This is because gases have high kinetic energy:
Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases
The particle theory of matter does not discuss the kinetic energy of
cles. Kinetic energy is important; however, when describing the unique
properties of gases.
The kinetic molecular theory of gases makes the following
assumptions:
The volume of an individual gas molecule is
negligible compared
to the volume of the container
holding the gas. This means that
individual gas molecules, with virtually no volume of their own,
are
extremely far apart and most of the container is
empty" space.
There are neither attractive nor
repulsive forces between gas
molecules ,
Gas molecules have high translational energy
move
randomly
in all directions, in straight lines (See Figure 11.6, on page 423.)
When gas molecules collide with each other Or with a container
wall, the collisions are perfectly elastic This means that when gas
molecules collide, somewhat like billiard balls, there is no loss of
kinetic energy:
The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly related to
the temperature.
The greater the temperature, the greater the
average motion of the molecules and the greater their average
kinetic energy.
The kinetic molecular theory describes a hypothetical gas called an
ideal gas. In an ideal gas, the gas
particles take up hardly any space. Also,
the particles of an ideal gas do not attract each other:

Why Use the Kinetic Molecular Theory?
How and why did scientists formulate the kinetic molecular theory?
Experiments into gas behaviour demonstrate that, under normal tempera-
tures and pressures, nearly all
behave in similar and
predictable
ways.
The properties and behaviours of real gases can be generalized into
a
theory of an ideal gas.
This generalization makes it possible for us to
calculate mathematically, with a high degree of accuracy, how real gases
will behave under varying conditions
Of course, no gas is really "ideal.
The ideal gas theory ignores certain
facts about real gases. For
example; an ideal gas particle does not take up
any space. In fact, you know that all particles of matter must take up
space. Gas particles are small and far apart, however Thus the space
occupied by the particles is insignificant compared to the total volume
of the container: You will learn more about the behaviour of real gases

Early Studies of Atmospheric Pressure

In the early seventeenth century, the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei

moved up the tube.
From 1641 to 1642, Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) served as
Galileo's secretary He continued Galileo's experiments and concluded
that the weight of air was pushing down on the rest of the water: The
weight of the air pushed water up the column. This was a logical conclu-
sion since gas molecules, like all matter on Earth, are
down by the
force of gravity.
Torricelli did further calculations involving the weight of the atmos-
phere pressing on the water: He then improved upon the experiment
by using mercury, which has a density 13.6 times greater than water:
He designed the apparatus which we now know as the barometer; shown
in Figure 11.10. Torricelli filled a glass tube of 1
cm diameter; closed at
one end, with mercury He then inverted the tube in a dish of mercury
Some of the mercury ran out of the tube. But about 760 mm of mercury
remained in the tube. This is about 13.6 times less than the height of
water that Galileo could pump. It is the air pushing on the mercury in the
dish that keeps this 760 mm of mercury in the tube.
Changes in Atmospheric Pressure
At first, Torricelli considered his experiment a failure. The height of the
vacuum
mercury column did not remain constant at 760 mm, but changed slightly
as the weather and air temperature changed. As you learned in Grade 10,
these small changes in the height of the mercury column provide us with
valuable information.

The Relationship Between Pressure and Volume
Figure 11.11 shows a meteorologist preparing to release a weather balloon
partially filled with helium gas. As the balloon rises, atmospheric pressure
decreases. The volume of the balloon increases.
Figure 11.11
Weather balloons are partially inflated with helium: They carry
specialised instruments to measure varying atmospheric conditions such as pressure,
temperature, and humidity:
Since the helium atoms inside the balloon move randomly in all
directions,
constantly bombard all the area inside the walls of the
balloon, exerting a pressure.
With decreasing atmospheric pressure, there
are fewer air molecules to collide with the outside of the balloon.
As the
pressure outside the balloon becomes less than that inside the balloon,
the balloon
expands. Given an expandable container; such as a balloon,
the volume
occupied by the gas will increase when external pressure
decreases. As external pressure increases, gas molecules are forced closer
together: The volume of gas then decreases.

learn about molar volume in Chapter 12.)
Think about how the relationship between pressure and area for
solids would apply if you were testing a gas in a three-dimensional
container: You know that according to the kinetic molecular theory, gas
molecules exert pressure over the entire inside surface of their container:
If the volume of the container is halved, what would happen to the
pressure of the gas inside the container?
Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was an Irish scientist with an interest in
chemistry. He investigated the relationship between pressure and volume
of gases at constant temperatures. By making careful measurements of the
volume of a trapped gas, he was able to describe what happened when
the pressure exerted on the gas was increased:
Figure 11.12 shows Boyle's
experiment. Boyle measured the length of the column of trapped air
compared to the length of the column of mercury: Since the length of the
mercury column is directly related to its volume, Boyle was able to
deduce the relationship between pressure and volume

a
temperature twice as warm as -5 C?
Mathematically, the answer would
be -10*C, but this is a colder temperature.
When mathematical manipula-
tions are involved in studying gas behaviour; you need to convert degree
Celsius temperatures into kelvins. This is done using the relationship
Tk =
'C + 273.15
or
C + 273
Most often, you will round off and use 273 as the conversion factor
relating K and 'C.
Charles' Law
Although Charles discovered that the volume of a fixed amount of gas
at constant pressure was
proportional to its temperature, he never
lished this finding: In 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) , a
French scientist, made reference to Charles' work in a
published paper:
The
relationship between temperature and volume has since become
known as Charles' law. Charles' law states that the volume of a fixed
mass
of gas is proportional to its temperature when the pressure is kept
constant.
As you can see from Figure 11.19 on page 442, the volume of a gas
increases O decreases by a fixed increment when subjected to a change in
temperature. The algebraic statement of Charles' law depends on using

Compressed Gases and Safety Concerns

gases under pressure must be handled. Chlorine gas can cause seri-
ous
respiratory problems and irritate the skin and mucous membranes. In
extreme cases, death from suffocation could result from exposure to this
gas. Yet chlorine is an important industrial product. Compounds of chlo-
rine are used in bleaches,
oxidizing agents, and solvents, and as interme-
diates in the manufacture of other substances.
Compressed gases are commonly stored in thick-walled
metal
cylinders designed especially for this purpose. All
cylinders must comply with Canadian Transport Commission
(CTC) regulations. Containers must be permanently marked with
a serial number and
specifications for the volume of the
cylinder
and the maximum pressure it can withstand. Containers must be
tested every five to ten years, with the date of the test stamped
on the
cylinder:

The Combined Gas Law
Boyle's law can be used to solve for changes in volume when pressure
changes. The gas must be in a closed system and the temperature must
remain constant. You can use Charles' law to solve for
changes in volume
with temperature changes. This law works only in a closed system in
which pressure remains constant: Gay-Lussac's law can solve
problems in
which the amount and volume of gas remain constant while the tempera-
ture and pressure change
As you learned, Boyle's law (V & 1/P) is expressed mathematically
as PV = k. Charles' law (V & T) is expressed
mathematically as VIT = k1
when temperature is recorded in kelvins. Combining these two
expressions gives:

If a
sample of a gas is trapped at a measured set of initial conditions,

As this gas is then subjected to changes in pressure and temperature,
the final condition of the gas can be described mathematically as

the combined gas law can be written as

What is the pressure contribution of COz to the atmospheric pressure
on a very
when the barometer read 0.98 atm? Convert your
answer into three different units.
What Is Required?
You must find the contribution of COz to the atmospheric pressure,
and then convert the units.
What Is Given?
According to Table 11.2, COz contributes 0.03% of the
atmospheric pressure. The total atmospheric pressure is 0.98 atm
The conversion factors of pressure are
1 atm = 760 torr = 760 mm Hg = 101.3 kPa
Plan Your Strategy
You need to multiply the total atmospheric pressure times COz '$
contribution to the total:
Then you can multiply the answer in atm by the conversion factors
to cancel out atm and obtain other units.

Nitrogen's Many Uses
Inert gases are not very reactive. The word inert is also a synonym for
sluggish and slow. Something with the property of inertness hardly
sounds useful! Yet this very property makes nitrogen extremely valuable
in technological and industrial applications
Because nitrogen gas reacts with very few substances, it can be used
to blanket substances, preventing them from reacting with oxygen. (A
reaction with oxygen is called oxidation:) Blanketing means covering
something with nitrogen, displacing all of the oxygen.
This usually

Liquid nitrogen's low boiling
(77 K) means that it can be used in
food preservation. Foods frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen retain more
nutrients than slowly frozen foods. Less damage is done to cell structure
during the quick-freezing process. Freezing foods this way also removes
moisture , decreasing their weight and size. Freeze-dried foods are often
used by people who require easily portable, lightweight food, such
as
campers, the military, and space explorers.
In cryosurgery, liquid nitrogen is used to fast-freeze cancerous tissues

dangerous place for humans The air that & diver breathes to stay alive
underwater can itself be one of the greatest hazards. That's because of the
tremendous pressure exerted by the waters above a diver: For roughly
every 10 metres of depth, water pressure on the diver's body adds the
equivalent of one unit of atmospheric pressure (Figure 11.31)
The air that a diver breathes (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) must equal
the pressure of the surrounding water if the diver's lungs are to
inflated. Of course, this gas pressure increases as a diver goes deeper
As the gas pressure increases, the diver's bloodstream and body tissues
absorb higher and higher volumes of gases.
Beyond depths of roughly 40-60 metres,
the increased volumes of gas in the diver's body
can cause

The dissolved gases such as nitrogen in the diver's bloodstream are
under pressure.
This is much like the carbon dioxide that is dissolved in a
can of soda. If the diver returns to the surface too quickly, these dissolved
gases behave similarly to the gas in soda when a can is opened. The gases

Volumes of Real Gases
You know that ideal gases have a volume of 22.4 L at STP Do real gases
have the same volume? The volumes of several real gases at STP are given
in Table 12.1. All the volumes are very close to 22.4 Llmol, the molar
volume of an ideal gas. Scientists have decided that 22.4 Llmol is an
acceptable approximation for any gas at STP when

Although the volumes are the same, one mole of a gas will have a differ-

Always convert the temperature to kelvins (K).
Always convert the masses to moles (mol).
Always convert the volumes to litres (L)

Molar Mass of a Gas
You can find the molar mass of a gaseous element OT compound in the
same way that you find the molar mass of any other element o compound:
by adding up the masses of the atoms. You can also find the molar mass
by dividing the mass by the number of moles. (See Figure 12.12.)

Including Water Vapour Pressure in Gas Calculations
You can collect many gases by allowing them to bubble up
through water into a container that is filled with water: (See
Figure 12.16). This is the method your teacher used to collect
the gas in Investigation 12-A. Unfortunately molecules of water
vapour mix with the gas sample. To avoid error; the pressure that
was contributed by the water vapour must be subtracted when
finding the pressure of the gas.
As an
example, consider hydrogen gas, which is often
collected over water: The hydrogen that is collected is a mixture
of hydrogen and water vapour: As you learned from Dalton's law
of partial pressures in Chapter 11, the pressure of this mixture is
=
+ Pwater vapour
To find the partial pressure of
hydrogen, subtract the pressure
of the water vapour from the total pressure.
Figure 12.16
This is an
efficient and convenient method

for collecting hydrogen gas.
The pressure of the water vapour is the same for any gas that is collected
Unfortunately molecules of water

particular temperature. For example, the pressure of water vapour at

25'C is 3.17 kPa
Table 12.3 gives the pressure of water vapour at different
temperatures.
When using the ideal gas law for a gas collected over water; you
must correct the pressure before you substitute it into the gas law The

In this section, you will look at the chemistry that takes place among

ozone and the
pollutants that affect this gas.
Gas Chemistry in the Atmosphere
Many important chemical reactions take place in the atmosphere.
All
these reactions involve gases. There are two main types of gas chemistry

Pollutants in the Atmosphere
Gases from living and non-living processes on Earth 's surface interact
with the gases in the atmosphere. For example, oxygen and carbon diox-
ide in the air are involved in animal and plant
respiration. A forest fire
burns plants to produce carbon dioxide gas. On a more damaging level,
human technology and industrial processes produce many polluting
gases. As you will learn in Chapter 14, burning fossil fuels is a major
source of gas
pollution in the atmosphere.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are an important class of polluting gases
that are not usually caused by burning fossil fuels. CFCs are stable and
harmless near the
ground. When

CFCs and Ozone Depletion
As you learned earlier; chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that
interfere with the ozone
high up in the atmosphere. CFCs are non-
toxic, nonflammable compounds that contain atoms of chlorine, carbon,
and fluorine_
These gases are human-made compounds that were released
into the atmosphere primarily from refrigeration and aerosol devices.
In 1928, Thomas Midgley invented the first CFC compound. Because

were referred to as
miracle compounds.
In particular, dichlorodifluoromethane, CClzFz, also known as Freon, was

Because of Freon, household refrigeration became common. In fact, much
of our
modern-day life style first became possible because of CFCs.
By 1974, millions of tonnes of CFCs had been produced (see Figure 12.22).
At the University of California, chemists F Sherwood Rowland and Mario
Molina began to wonder where all of these CFCs ended up.

The Effects of Ozone Depletion
How do we know that CFCs and other ozone-destroying
molecules are
having an effect on the atmosphere? As
Figure 12.24 illustrates, ozone levels over Canada and
other parts of the world have decreased significantly
since the late 1970s.
With reduced ozone levels, more ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun reaches Earth. Among
humans , UV-induced skin cancer and eye damage
are
becoming
a serious threat. The increased levels
of radiation also damage phytoplankton in fresh
and marine ecosystems. Since phytoplankton are
the base of the aquatic food chain, this damage
affects all other water species. As you learned
earlier; the presence of ozone close to Earth damages
crops and forests.
A lack of ozone in the atmosphere,
however; also reduces the yield of crops, such as barley
and canola, and harms forests.

Much of the

Naming Alkanes
The IUPAC system for naming organic compounds is very logical and
thorough. The rules for naming alkanes are the basis for naming the other
organic compounds that you will study: Therefore it is important that you
understand how to name alkanes.
Naming Straight-Chain
Alkanes
Recall that carbon can bond to form
continuous, chain-like struc-
tures. Alkanes that bond in this way are called straight-chain alkanes.
(They are also called unbranched alkanes ) Straight-chain alkanes are
the simplest alkanes Table 13.2 lists the names of the first ten straight-
chain alkanes_

Like many hydrocarbons, this isomer of CsH14 has a branch-like
structure.
Alkanes such as

Drawing Alkanes
As you learned earlier in this chapter; three kinds of diagrams can be used
to represent the structure of a hydrocarbon. The easiest kind is probably
the condensed structural diagram.
When you are asked to draw a con-
densed structural diagram for an alkane, such as 2,3-dimethylhexane,
you can follow several simple rules. These rules are listed below. After
you have studied the rules, use the Practice Problems to practise your
alkane-drawing skills.

polar; which gives them physical properties similar to those of alkanes.
Alkenes are different from alkanes, however; in a number of ways.
First, their bonds are different, as indicated by their suffixes. As you
will recall, the -ane
ending tells
that alkane compounds are joined by
single bonds.
The -ene
ending for alkenes tells you that these compounds
have one or more double bonds.
A
double bond involves four bonding
electrons between two carbon atoms, instead of the two
bonding electrons
in all alkane bonds. Examine Figure 13.18 to see how the presence of a
double bond affects the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkene.

The general formula for an alkene is CnHzn: You can check this against
the next two members of the alkene series. Propene has three carbon
atoms, so you would expect it to have six hydrogens. Butene has four car-
bon atoms, s0 it should have eight hydrogens. The formulas for propene
and butene are CzH6 and C4H8
s0 the general formula is accurate. Note,
however; that the general formula

per molecule. You will learn about alkenes with multiple double bonds in
future chemistry courses.
Properties of Alkenes
The general formula for alkenes implies that at least two carbon atoms
in any alkene compound have fewer than four bonded atoms. As a result,
chemists refer to alkenes as unsaturated compounds. Unlike saturated
compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbons contain carbon atoms that can
potentially bond to additional atoms.
Unsaturated compounds have physical and chemical properties that

differ from those of saturated compounds. For example, the boiling

of alkenes are usually slightly less than the boiling
of similar-sized
alkanes (alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms) This difference
reflects the fact that the forces between molecules are slightly less for
alkenes than for alkanes. For example, the boiling
of ethane is
-89'C, whereas the boiling
of ethene is -104'C. On the other hand;,
both alkenes and alkanes have a low solubility in water: Alkenes, like all
aliphatic compounds, are non-polar:

In polymerization, hundreds of ethene molecules are reacted and strung

On the
previous page, you learned that ethene is used to ripen fruit.
How does this work? When a fruit ripens, enzymes in the fruit begin to
produce ethene gas. The ethene is responsible for the colour change, as
well as the
softening and sweetening that occur as the fruit ripens. Food
chemists have learned that

delay ripening) by keeping fruits at a low temperature as

transported. Once the fruits reach their final destination, ethene can be
pumped into the fruit containers to hasten the ripening process No

In the next investigation, you will use reactivity to identify saturated

Alkynes
Carbon and
hydrogen atoms can be arranged in many ways to produce a
great variety of compounds. Yet another way involves triple bonds in the
structure of compounds. This bond structure creates a class of aliphatic
compounds called alkynes.
Alkynes are aliphatic compounds that contain
one
or more
triple bonds.
Naming and Drawing Alkynes
Both double and triple bonds are multiple bonds Therefore alkynes are
unsaturated hydrocarbons, just as alkenes are_
To name alkynes and draw
their structures, you follow the same rules that you used for alkenes.
The
only difference is the suffix -yne, which you need to use when naming
alkyne compounds.
Also, remember to count the number of bonds for
each carbon. An alkyne bond counts as three bonds
CH3
C=C~CH-_CH:
As you might expect, the presence of a triple bond in alkynes makes
their physical and chemical properties different from those of alkanes and
alkenes.
A structure with a
triple bond must be linear around the bond:
(See Figure 13.24.) This means that the shapes of alkynes are different
from the shapes of alkanes and alkenes.
As well, the triple bond makes
the molecule much more reactive-
even
more s0 than the double bond.
In fact, few alkynes occur naturally because
are s0 reactive.
Alkynes are similar to both alkanes and alkenes because
form a

(a male sex hormone) and estrone (a female sex hormone): Steroids also
have important medicinal uses.
For example, budesonide is a steroid
that is used to treat asthma: One of the most common steroids is
cholesterol. This compound is essential to your normal body functions,
but it has been linked to blocked artery walls and heart disease, as well:
Steroids have also been associated with misuse, especially at the

occur when the two ends of a hydrocarbon chain join together: In order to
do this, a hydrogen atom from each end carbon must be removed, just as
in the formation of a multiple bond. (See Figure 13.26 on the next page.)

Because of the
structure, the
naming rules for
hydro-
carbons, including cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, are slightly different
from those for alkanes and alkenes. Below are four examples to illustrate
the
naming rules.
To draw
hydrocarbons, start with the rules you learned for
drawing other types of compounds. To place multiple bonds and branches,
you have the option of counting in either direction around the

corners (carbon atoms) in the

Example 2:
When naming cyclic compounds, all carbon atoms in the
CH:
are treated as equal. This means that any carbon can be carbon number 1.
In Figure 13.28, only one branch is attached to the ring: Therefore the
carbon that the branch is attached to is carbon number 1_
Because this
branch automatically gets the lowest possible position number; no position
number is required in the name: Thus the name of this compound is

alphabetical order and to add the position numbers in ascending order: So
the name of this structure is 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclohexane.
Figure 13.29
Example 4:
In Figure 13.30, there is a double bond, represented by the
extra vertical line inside the ring structure.
You must follow the same rules
as for alkenes. That is, the double bond gets priority for the lowest number
This means that one of the carbon atoms, on either end of the double bond,
CH:
must be carbon number 1_
The carbon atom at the other end must be carbon
number 2.
Next you have to decide in which direction to count so that the
branch gets the lowest possible position number: In this compound, the
carbon atom on the bottom end of the double bond is carbon number 1.
Then you can count clockwise so that the methyl group on the top carbon

of the ring has position number 3. (Counting in the other direction would
give a higher locating number for the branch ) The name of this structure
is 3-methyl-1-cyclohexene.

Reliance on hydrocarbons has increased substantially since the nineteenth

the raw materials that are used to
synthesize petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals are basic hydrocarbons, such as ethene and propene, that
are converted into plastics and other synthetic materials. Petroleum is the
chief source of the
petrochemicals that drive our cars and Our economy
Petroleum is not a pure substance, however: Rather; petroleum is a com-

During a typical combustion reaction, an element O

example of a combustion reactions:
Hydrocarbon compounds will burn in the presence of air to produce
oxides.
This is a chemical property of all hydrocarbons. Complete

What Is Required?
You need to write the equation. Then you need to balance the atoms
of the reactants and the products.
What Is Given?
You know that
acetylene (ethyne) and oxygen are the reactants. Since
the reaction is a

The ThoughtLab gave you some insight into the factors that are important
when measuring energy changes. How can you use these factors to calcu-

factor and determine its relationship to heat transfer: You will begin with
the most obvious factor: temperature.
Then you will look at how the mass
of a substance affects the quantity of thermal energy it can store. Finally,
you will look at the type of substance and how it affects heat transfer

Mass of Substance

enormous mass of water absorbs and releases tremendous amounts of
heat energy Water makes our climate more moderate by absorbing heat
in hot weather and releasing heat in cold weather: The greater the mass
of the water; the greater the amount of heat it can absorb and release.

Calorimetry
In the ThoughtLab in section 14.3, two students used beakers with no lids
when
measured change in temperature. The students assumed that
energy was
exchanged only between the ice and the water: In fact,
energy was also
being exchanged with the surroundings.
As a result, the
data that the students obtained had
a
large experimental error: How could
the students have prevented this error?
Much of the
technology in our lives is designed to stop the flow of
heat: Your home is insulated to prevent heat loss in the winter and heat
in the summer: If you take hot soup to school for your lunch, you
probably use a ThermosT to prevent heat loss to the environment:
Whenever there is a temperature difference between two objects,
thermal energy flows from the hotter object to the colder object: When

Heat of Combustion
How much energy is needed for a natural gas water heater; like the one
shown in Figure 14.18, to heat the hot water in your home? It is probably
much more than you think! In the next Sample Problem, you will find
out. You will also calculate the heat of combustion of a
hydrocarbon: the
heat that is released when combustion occurs.
Sample Problem
Calculating Thermal Energy _

Many homes in North America use natural gas for general heating
and for water heating: Like calorimeters, natural gas water heaters
have an insulated container that is filled with water: A gas flame at

(a) How much thermal energy is needed to raise the temperature of
151 L of water from 20.5*C to 65.0'C? Note: Make the same three
assumptions that you made for calorimeters
(b) If it takes 506 g of methane to heat this water; what is the heat of

burned.
What Is Given?
(a) You know the initial and final temperatures of the water: You also
know the volume of the water:
Initial temperature (T;) = 20.5*C
Final temperature (T;) = 65.0'C
Volume = 151 L
As well,
know the specific heat capacity of water (c):
4.184 Jlg "C or 4.184 kJ/kg: "C.
(b) You know the mass of the methane. Mass of methane (m) = 506 g
Plan Your Strategy
(a) This problem involves thermal energy and a change in tempera-
ture. You can use the heat equation Q = mcAT. First calculate the
mass of 151 L of water: (Remember that the density of water at
room temperature is 1 g/mL, O1
1
kg/L ) If you express the mass of
the water in kilograms, you must also use the appropriate specific
heat capacity of water: 4.184 kJ/kg 'C
Note: To
the calculation simple, assume that the density of
the water remains the same when it is heated. (This is not strictly
true.)

measured in Calories.
You have probably noticed that Calories are used more often than
kilojoules when discussing the energy in food (Figure 14.21). How are
these terms related?
For years, chemists used the calorie as a unit of energy. One calorie is
equal to 4.184 J This is the amount of energy that is required to heat
1 g
of liquid water by 1C. The food Calorie (notice the upper-case C) is equal
to one thousand calories, Or one kilocalorie. Therefore one food Calorie is
to 4.184 kJ.

List two characteristics of a calorimeter that are necessary for
successful heat measurement.
A calorimeter is calibrated at 7.61 kJ/'C. When a sample of coal is
burned in the calorimeter; the temperature increases by 5.23*C. How

was lost by the coal?
A reaction in a calorimeter causes 150 g of water to decrease in
temperature by 5.0*C. What is the thermal energy change of the water?
A company claims that its new Calorie-reduced dessert has less
than 10 Cal per serving: To test this claim, a technician at the depart-

the dessert in a bomb calorimeter: The temperature change is 4.86C.
The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 8.28 kJ/"C. Is the company's

heats of combustion, a chemical property, of propane, butane, and
paraffin. Use a reference book, such as The CRC Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics. Look up the following hydrocarbons:
methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and hexane. Compare
their densities, melting points, boiling points, and heats of combus-

A benefit is an
advantage, or positive result: For example, riding a bicycle provides the
benefits of exercise, transportation, and enjoyment: When deciding to do
an
activity, it may be a
idea to compare the risks and benefits
involved. (See Figure 14.29.)
Risk-Benefit Analysis
Knowing more about an issue helps you assess its risks and benefits
more accurately How can you make the most informed decision
possible?
Follow these steps to do your own assessment of risks and benefits, called
a risk-benefit analysis.
Step 1
Identify possible risks and benefits of the activity: Decide how to
research these risks and benefits_
2
Research the risks and benefits. You need information from reliable
sources to make
accurate analysis.
Step 3
Weigh the effects of the risks and benefits. You may find that the
risks are too great and decide not to do the activity On the other
hand, you may find that the benefits are greater than the risks.
