Scientists have been able to gather information about atoms without actually seeing
them. Perform the following activity to get an idea about the structure of the atom.
Take an onion. It looks solid. Peel off a layer, and you will find another layer
underneath. Layer after layer surfaces as the onion is peeled off. Keep on peelingto its core.
Analysis
1.How do you compare this with the atomic model?
2.What do the layers represent in the atomic model?
3.What does the core represent in the atom?
Two thousand years ago, ancient Greek philosophers developed a theory of matter
that was not based on the experimental evidences. A notable Greek philosopher,namely, Democritus , believed that all matter was composed of very tiny, indivisible
particles. He called them atomos . Hence, the word ‘atom’ came from the Greek word
atomos, which means uncuttable or indivisible.
Aristotle  was part of the generation that succeeded Democritus . He did not believe in
atomos. Aristotle thought that all matter was continuous. That is, if one proceeded onbreaking down a substance, it would be impossible to reach to the last indivisibleparticle. In other words, it would continue to divide infinitely. His opinion wasaccepted for nearly 200 years.
The early concept of atoms was simply a result of thinking and reasoning on the part
of the philosophers, instead of experimental observations. In 1803, however, John
Dalton  proposed a completely different theory of matter. His theory was based on
scientific experimental observations and logical laws. These scientific assumptions were
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
3very closely related to what is presently known about the atom. Due to this,  John
Dalton  is often referred to as the father of modern atomic theory.
Dalton also worked on the relative masses of atoms and gave symbols to some
elements as illustrated in Figure 1.1.
1.1  Atomic Theory
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• describe Dalton’s atomic theory;
• describe modern atomic theory; and
• compare and contrast Dalton’s atomic theory with modern atomic theory.
Form a group and discuss  the following idea: Dalton’s contribution was different from that
of the ancient Greeks who postulated the existence of atoms. Point out the differences
between the two ideas. Present your discussion to the class.
Even though the idea of the existence of atoms and atomic theory dates back to
classical times, as discussed earlier, only Dalton's  atomic theory ideas were the basis
for the new era of science.
1.1.1  Dalton’s Atomic Theory
Activity 1.1
British physicist and chemist John Dalton  is best known for
developing the atomic theory of elements and molecules, the
foundation of modern physical science. While pondering thenature of the atmosphere during a meteorological study in the
early 1800s, Dalton  deduced the structure of carbon dioxide and
proposed that an exact number of atoms constitute eachmolecule. He held that all atoms of a given element are identical
and different from the atoms of every other element. The first to
classify elements according to their atomic weights, Dalton setthe stage for a revolution in scientific thought.John DaltonHistorical Note
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
4In 1804, John Dalton  developed the first modern theory of atoms and proposed their
existence. Dalton's  atomic theory was based directly on the ideas of elements and
compounds, and on the three laws of chemical combination. The three laws are:
i)The law of conservation of mass  states that matter is neither created nor
destroyed. This law is also called the law of indestructibility of matter. It meansthat the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the mass of the products inany chemical reaction. A chemical reaction involves only the separation and unionof atoms.
ii)The law of definite proportions  states that a pure compound is always
composed of the same elements combined in a definite ratio by mass. Forexample, water ( H
2O) is composed of hydrogen and oxygen only. These elements
are always in the proportion of 11.19% hydrogen to 88.81% oxygen by massand in the proportion 2 : 1 by volume.
iii) The law of multiple proportions  states that when two different compounds are
formed from the same elements, the masses of one of the elements in the twocompounds, compared to a given mass of the other element, is in a small whole-number ratio. For example, carbon and oxygen form two compounds: carbonmonoxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide contains 1.3321 g of oxygenfor each 1 g of carbon, whereas carbon dioxide contains 2.6642 g of oxygenfor each 1g of carbon. Hence, carbon dioxide contains twice the mass of oxygenas does carbon monoxide.
Activity 1.2
Activity 1.2
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Using two chemical compounds as an example, describe the difference between the law
of definite proportions and the law of multiple proportions.
Dalton  proved that these laws are entirely reasonable if the elements are composed of
tiny particles, which he called atoms . An atom is the smallest fundamental particle of
an element.
The basic postulates of Dalton’s Atomic Theory are summarized as follows:
1.All elements are made up of small particles called atoms.
2.Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.
3.All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and in all other properties.
4.Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.
5.Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine.
6.In a given compound, the relative numbers and types of atoms are constant.
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
5Although some of these postulates, like postulate number 2 and number 3, have been
shown to be incorrect by later work, Dalton's  theory was a brilliant and logical
explanation of many experimental discoveries and laws that were known at that time.
Activity 1.2
Form a group. Discuss  the following laws and present to the class.
Use Dalton’s atomic theory to explain:
aThe law of conservation of mass
bThe law of definite proportions
cThe law of multiple proportions.
1.1.2  Modern Atomic Theory
Towards the end of the 19th century, various experimental discoveries revealed the
existence of subatomic particles, isotopes, and so on. In light of these findings,Dalton's Atomic Theory  was modified.
The Modern Atomic Theory can be summarized as follows:
1.Atoms are the smallest particles of all elements that can take part in a chemical
reaction.
2.An atom is divisible. It can be subdivided into electrons, protons, and neutrons.
An atom is also indestructible i.e., atoms can neither be created nor destroyed
during ordinary chemical reactions.
3.Atoms of the same element may not be identical in mass because of the existence
of isotopes.
4.Atoms of the same elements have identical chemical properties.
5.Atoms of different elements have different chemical properties.
6.Atoms of two or more elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form
compounds.

6 1.2  DISCOVERIES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SUBATOMIC
PARTICLES AND THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• explain the discovery of the electron;
• explain the discovery of the nucleus;• explain the discovery of the neutron.
Activity 1.3
Form a group and discuss the following ideas.  Present your discussion to the rest of the
class.
1.In your grade 7 chemistry lesson, you have learned that atoms consist of three
fundamental subatomic particles. What are these? Where is their location in the atoms?
What are their charges?
2.What were the consequences of the discoveries of subatomic particles on Dalton’s
atomic theory?
In the late 1880’s, John Dalton  thought atoms were indivisible. However, a series of
investigations and astounding discoveries clearly demonstrated that atoms are made upof smaller particles, called subatomic particles. The three fundamental subatomic
particles  of an atom are electrons, protons, and neutrons.
1.2.1  Discovery of the Electron
Do you think that there is a similarity between cathode rays and electrons?
The electron was the first subatomic particle to be identified. In 1879, William
Crooke  studied electrical discharges in partially evacuated tubes called
discharge tubes .
Two electrodes from a high-voltage source are sealed into a glass tube from which air
has been evacuated. The negative electrode is the cathode and the positive one is theanode. When the high-voltage current is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenishlight and a beam of light is seen at the anode. These rays flow from the cathodetowards the anode in a straight line. They are called cathode rays . Later on, in 1897,
J.J. Thomson  found that the beam was deflected by both electrical and magnetic
Activity 1.4
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
7fields. In an electric field, they bend toward the positive plate. From this he concluded
that the cathode rays are made up of very small negatively charged particles, which henamed electrons . He concluded that electrons are constituents of all matter, because
he obtained the same results when he changed the gas and the electrode in the tube.
Figure 1.2   A simple cathode-ray tube.
Properties of Cathode Rays
Cathode rays possess the following properties:
1.An object placed between the cathode and the opposite end of the tube,
casts a shadow on the glass. This shows that the cathode rays travel in a
straight line.
2.A paddle wheel placed in the path of cathode rays rotates. This indicates that
cathode rays are of particle nature-the particles strike the paddle and therefore
move the wheel.

Figure 1.3   A paddle wheel placed in the path of cathode ray.
3.When an electric or magnetic field is applied in the path of cathode rays, they
are deflected towards the positive plate. This shows that cathode rays are
negatively charged.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
84.The properties of cathode rays (like charge to mass ratio, e–/m ratio) do not
depend on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube or on the material of the
cathode. This shows that electrons are present in the atoms of all elements.
Thus, cathode-ray experiments provided evidence that atoms are divisible into small
particles, and that one of the atom’s basic constituents is the negatively charged
particle called electron .
PROJECT WORK
Produce a model of ca thode ray tube from simple and locally available materials
such as glass tube, copper wire and rubber stoppers. Using your model show how
cathode rays are generat ed and explain their properties.
Charge and Mass of an Electron
J.J. Thomson  studied the deflection of cathode rays under the simultaneous application
of electric and magnetic fields, that are applied perpendicular to each other. Hisexperiment led to the precise determination of the charge-to-mass ratio ( e
–/m) of an
electron, and this ‘ e–/m’ value was found to be 1.76 × 108 coulomb/g. Coulomb is a
unit of electric charge.
Activity 1.5
Form a group and discuss how J.J Thomson's determination of the charge-to-mass ratio of
the electron led to the conclusion that atoms were composed of sub atomic particles.Present your findings to the class.
In 1909, Robert Millikan  determined the charge of an electron ( e–), using the  oil drop
experiment. He found the charge of an electron to be 1.60 × 10–19 coulombs.
Combination of e–/m and e– values are used to determine the mass of an electron,
which is found to be 9.11 × 10–31 kg.
From Thomson’s  experiment, e–/m = 1.76 × 108 C/g
From Millikan’s  experiment, e– = 1.60 × 10–19 C

From the above discussion, it follows that:
An electron is a fundamental particle of an atom carrying a negative charge and having
a very small mass. The mass of an electron is approximately 11837 times the mass
of a hydrogen atom.

1.2.2  Discovery of the Atomic Nucleus
Radioactivity
In 1895, the German physicist, Wilhelm Röntgen  noticed that cathode rays caused
glass and metals to emit very unusual rays. This highly energetic radiation penetrated
matter, darkened covered photographic plates, and caused a variety of substances tofluoresce. Since these rays could not be deflected by a magnet, they could not containcharged particles as cathode rays do. Röntgen  called them X-rays.
Not long after Röntgen’s  discovery, Antoine Becquerel , a professor of physics in
Paris, began to study fluorescent properties of substances. He found that exposingthickly wrapped photographic plates to a certain uranium compound caused them todarken, even without the stimulation of cathode rays. Like X-rays, the rays from theuranium compound were highly energetic and could not be deflected by a magnet.Also, these rays were generated spontaneously. One of Becquerel's students, Marie
Curie , suggested the name radioactivity  to describe this spontaneous emission of
particles and/or radiation. Consequently, any element that spontaneously emitsradiation is said to be radioactive .
Further investigation revealed that three types of rays are produced by the “decay”, or
breakdown of radioactive substances such as uranium, polonium, and radium. Theseare alpha, beta, and gamma rays.
Alpha (α) rays  consist of positively charged particles called α-particles . They are
deflected by positively charged plates. Beta (β) rays  or β-particles  are electrons of
nuclear origin that are deflected by negatively charged plates. The third type ofradioactive radiation consists of high-energy rays called gamma (γ) rays . Like X-rays,
γ-rays have no charge and are not affected by an external electric or magnetic field.
Activity 1.6
Form a group and discuss the following ideas. Present your discussion to the class.
Scientists discovered the three subatomic particles (electrons, protons and neutrons).
Compare and contrast these fundamental sub atomic particles with alpha particles, betaparticles and gamma rays in terms of the nature of the particles.
More details about the structure of an atom were provided in 1911 by Ernest
Rutherford  and his associates, Hans Geiger  and Ernest Marsden . The scientists
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
10bombarded a thin gold foil with fast moving alpha particles . Alpha particles are positively
charged particles with about four times the mass of a hydrogen atom. Geiger  and
Marsden  assumed that mass and charge were uniformly distributed throughout the atoms
of the gold foil. Therefore, they expected the alpha particles to pass through the gold foil
with only a slight deflection. However, when the scientists checked for the possibility ofwide-angle deflections, they were shocked to find that roughly 1 in 8000 of the alphaparticles had actually been redirected back toward the source.
After thinking about the observations for two years, Rutherford  finally came up with
an explanation. He reasoned that the rebounded alpha particles must have
experienced some powerful force within the atom. He concluded that the source of
this force must occupy a very small amount of space because very few of the totalnumber of alpha particles had been affected by it. He also concluded that the forcemust be caused by a very densely packed bundle of matter with a positive electriccharge. Rutherford called this small, dense, positive bundle of matter the nucleus .
Figure 1.4    Rutherford’s a – particles experiment.
Rutherford ’s Conclusion
1.Since most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected, most of
the space in an atom is empty.
2.Some of the α-particles were deflected by small angles. This indicated the presence
of a heavy positive centre in the atom, which Rutherford named the nucleus.
3.Only a few particles (1 in about a million) were either deflected by a very large
angle or deflected back. This confirmed that the space occupied by the heavypositive centre must be very small.
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
11
Activity 1.7
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Predict what Rutherford might have observed if he had bombarded copper metal instead
of gold metal with alpha particles.
From the angles through which alpha particles are deflected, Rutherford calculated
that the nucleus of an atom has a radius of about 10–15 m. The radius of the whole
atom is about 10–10 m. Therefore, the nucleus is about 1/10,000 (one ten-thousandth)
of the size of the atom as a whole. Thus, if we magnified an atom to the size of afootball stadium (about 100 m across), the nucleus would be represented by a peaplaced at the centre of the pitch.
Rutherford  suggested that the negatively charged electrons surrounding the positively
charged nucleus are like planets around the sun revolving. He could not explain,
however, what kept the electrons in motion around the nucleus.
1.2.3  Discovery of Neutrons
In 1932, an English scientist, James Chadwick , identified the existence of neutrons.
He bombarded a thin foil of beryllium with α-particles of a radioactive substance. He
then observed that highly penetrating rays, consisting of electrically neutral particles of
a mass approximately equal to that of the proton, were produced. These neutralparticles are called neutrons .
A neutron is a subatomic particle carrying no charge and having a mass of 1.675 ×
10
–24 g. This mass is almost equal to that of a proton or of a hydrogen atom.
Exercise 1.3

i)electrons are negatively charged particles?
ii)electrons are the constituents of all atoms?

gold foil undeflected. What does this indicate?
3.In Rutherford’s experiment, some of the α-particles were deflected by small
angles. What does this indicate?
4.What was determined from Millikan’s oil drop experiment?

cAn atom of calcium has a mass of 40 a.m.u. An atom of cobalt has a mass of
59 a.m.u.
Are these findings in agreement with Dalton’s  atomic theory? Discuss your conclusions in
your group.
All atoms have two regions. The nucleus is a very small region located at the center of
an atom. Except for the nucleus of the simplest type of hydrogen atom, all atomicnuclei are made of two kinds of particles, protons  and neutrons . Surrounding the
nucleus, there is a region occupied by negatively charged particles called electrons .
This region is very large compared with the size of the nucleus. A proton has apositive charge, which is equal in magnitude to the negative charge of an electron.Atoms are electrically neutral because they contain equal numbers of protons andelectrons.
Figure 1.6  A simple representation of an atom.
A proton has a mass of 1.673 × 10–27 kg, and a neutron has a mass of 1.675 × 10–27
kg. Hence, protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass. Most of the
mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus, assuming the mass of an electron tobe negligible or almost zero.

Based on the table, answer the following questions:
i)Which of the species are neutral?
ii) Which of them are negatively charged?
iii) Give the symbolic representations for ' B' , 'D' and  ' F'
All atoms are composed of the same basic particles. Yet all atoms are not the same.
Atoms of different elements have different number of protons. Atoms of the same
element have the same number of protons.
The Atomic Number  (Z) of an element is equal to the number of protons in the
nucleus of an atom. It is also equal to the number of electrons in the neutral atom.
Z = p+  or  Z = e–    (in a natural atom)
For different elements, the nuclei of their atoms differ in the number of protons they
contain. Therefore, they differ in the amount of positive charge that their atomspossess. Thus, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines the identityof an atom.
Each atom of an element is identified by its atomic number. In the periodic table, the
atomic number of an element is indicated below its symbol. Notice that the elementsare placed in order of increasing atomic number. Hydrogen, H, has atomic number 1,
hence, atoms of the element hydrogen have one proton in the nucleus. Next is helium,He, which has two protons in its nucleus. Lithium, Li, has three protons. Beryllium,
Be, has four protons, and so on.
Mass Number ( A) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of
an atom. Collectively, the protons and neutrons of an atom are called its nucleons .
Mass Number ( A) = Number of protons + Number of neutrons
A = p
+ + n°
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
16The name of an element, its atomic number and mass number can be represented by
a shorthand symbol. For example, to represent neutral atoms of magnesium with 12
protons and 12 neutrons, the symbol is 24 12Mg. The atomic number is written as a
subscript to the left of the symbol of magnesium. The mass number is written as asuperscript to the left of the symbol. This method can be represented in general by
the following illustration, in which X stands for any chemical symbol.
Mass Number A
Atomic Number Z Xo r X
24
12Mg can be read as “Magnesium-24”, and “Magnesium-25” represents25
12Mg. In a
similar manner, 23
11Na can be read as “Sodium-23”.
The number of neutrons in an atom is found by subtracting the atomic number from
the mass number. For example, the number of neutrons for a silver atom (108
47Ag) is:
Mass number – Atomic number = Number of neutrons
108 – 47 = 61
∴ The number of neutrons is 61.
Example 1
How many protons, electrons, and neutrons are found in an atom of bromine-80
if its atomic number is 35?
Solution:
Atomic number of bromine is 35.Mass number of bromine is already given as 80.  Now we can write bromine,
Br in the form of:
XA
Z BrA
Zas = Br80
35
Mass number – Atomic number = Number of neutrons
80 – 35 = 45 neutrons
For a neutral atom: number of protons = number of electrons = atomic number.
\   Number of protons = Number of electrons = 35

and it is radioactive. It exists in very small amounts in nature, but it can be preparedartificially. Each tritium atom contains one proton and two neutrons.  Protium,deuterium and tritium are the three isotopes of hydrogen.
Isotopes  are the atoms of the same element that have the same atomic number but different
masses number . The isotopes of a particular element have the same number of protons and
electrons but different number of neutrons. Isotopes of an element may occur naturally, orthey may be made in the laboratory (artificial isotopes). Since isotopes have the samenumber of protons and electrons, they have the same chemical properties.
Designating Isotopes
Isotopes are usually identified by specifying their mass number. There are two
methods for specifying isotopes.  In the first method, the mass number is writtenwith a hyphen after the name of the element. Tritium, for example, is written asHydrogen-3 . We will refer to this method as hyphen notation . The second method for
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9

Hydrogen-3 is written as 3
1H. The following table illustrates this designation of
isotopes for hydrogen and helium.

Relative Atomic Masses
Actual masses of atoms, measured in grams, are very small.  An atom of oxygen-16,
for example, has a mass of 2.657 × 10–23g. For most chemical calculations, it is more
convenient to use relative atomic masses. In order to set up a relative scale of atomic
mass, one atom has been arbitrarily chosen as the standard and assigned a relative mass
value. The masses of all other atoms are expressed in terms of this defined standard.
The standard used by scientists to determine units of atomic mass is the carbon-12
atom. It has been arbitrarily assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units, or 12
a.m.u. One atomic mass unit , or 1 a.m.u , is exactly 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12
atom, or 1.660 × 10–24 g. The atomic mass of any atom is determined by
comparing it with the mass of the carbon-12 atom. The hydrogen-1 atom has an
atomic mass of about 1/12 of that of the carbon-12 atom, or about 1 a.m.u. The
precise value of the atomic mass of a hydrogen-1 atom is 1.007 a.m.u. An oxygen-16 atom has about 16/12 (or 4/3 the mass of a carbon-12 atom). Careful
measurements show the atomic mass of oxygen-16 to be 15.994 a.m.u. The mass
of a magnesium-24 atom is found to be slightly less than twice that of a carbon-12
atom. Its atomic mass is 23.985 a.m.u.
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM

Activity 1.15The masses of subatomic particles can also be expressed on the atomic-mass scale.
The mass of an electron is 0.0005486 a.m.u, that of the proton is 1.007276 a.m.u,and that of the neutron is 1.008665 a.m.u. Note that the proton and neutron massesare close to 1 a.m.u but not equal to 1 a.m.u. You have learned that the mass numberis the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. You can nowsee that the mass number and relative atomic mass of a given nucleus are quite closeto each other. They are not identical because the proton and neutron masses deviateslightly from 1 a.m.u.
Form a group and perform the following task, based on the given information:
Magnesium has three naturally occurring isotopes, namely Mg-12, Mg-13, and Mg-14.
Make models of three isotopes of magnesium using locally available materials such as clay,

Present your model to the class.
Average Atomic Masses of Elements
Most elements occur naturally as mixtures of isotopes, as shown in the examples in
Table 1.3 . The percentage of each isotope in the naturally occurring elements is nearly
always the same, no matter where the element is found. The percentage at which eachisotope of an element occurs in nature is taken into account when calculating theaverage atomic mass of the element. Average atomic mass  is the weighted average of
the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of an element.

* Since tritium is radioactive and exists in a very small amount in nature, it is not
included in the calculation of atomic mass of hydrogen.

relative atomic mass and percentage abundance of each isotope and dividing by 100.

Solution:
75.77 % of natural chlorine exists as chlorine 35, and the rest 24.23 % as
chlorine 37.
The average atomic mass of chlorine is calculated as follows:
= (75.77 × 35) + (24.23 × 37)

you heard the word “ model ” in your everyday life? Car makers produce different models as
time passes. What is your understanding about the atomic model?
Atoms are too small to be observed directly. Hence, it is better to develop a tentative
mental picture ( model ) of the atomic concept. The ideas about atoms have changed
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
22many times. But, at present we can reduce these ideas into five models: Dalton’s
Model, Thomson’s Model, Rutherford’s Model, Bohr’s Model, and the QuantumMechanical Model.
i)   Dalton’s Atomic Model
This model of atoms was accepted for 100 years without serious challenge. He
thought of atoms as solid indestructible spheres. He called it the billiard ball model .
Figure 1.7   Dalton’s model of an atom.
ii)  Thomson Model
After learning that atoms contain electrons, Thomson  proposed a new model of the
atom, which is shown in  Figure 1.8 . It is sometimes called the plum-pudding model . In
his model of an atom, Thomson proposed thought that electrons were embedded
inside a positively charged sphere, just like plums in a pudding. Today we might callThomson’s  model the chocolate chip ice-cream model .

Activity 1.17
Perform the following tasks in groups and present your findings to the class.
1. Draw a sketch diagram of a carbon atom using Thomson's atomic model.
2. What was incorrect about Thomson's model of the atom?
iii)   Rutherford Model
Why was Thomson’s model of atom discarded and replaced by
Rutherford’s model?
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
23By 1911, evidence was collected that allowed scientists to modify Thomson’s model
of an atom. Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) , a former student of Thomson, performed
one of the classic experiments of scientific history. As indicated earlier in this unit, hebombarded different types of matter with high-energy, positively charged alphaparticles. Based on the Thomson’s  model of an atom, Rutherford  hypothesized that
the alpha particles should go through very thin metal foils undeflected. However, afterperforming an experiment on gold leaf, he found that a small but significant number ofthe alpha particles were deflected through large angles by the gold atoms. Theseresults showed Rutherford that the Thomson model of the atom was not valid. Auniform positive charge with embedded negatively charged electrons would notinteract with the alpha particles in such a manner.
The Rutherford model of the atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus
around which electrons whirl at high speeds and at relatively long distances from it.He compared the structure of an atom with the solar system, saying that the nucleuscorresponds to the sun, while the electrons correspond to the planets. This picture ofthe atom is also called the planetary atom . In other words, Rutherford  gave us the
nuclear model  of the atom.
Even though Rutherford  showed that the atom has a nucleus, he did not know how
the electrons were arranged outside the nucleus. This was the major drawback of
Rutherford’s model of an atom.
Figure 1.9   Rutherford model.
A Nobel Prize winner, Niels Bohr , was known not only for his
own theoretical work, but also as a mentor to younger physicists
who themselves made important contributions to physical
theory. As the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at
the University of Copenhagen, Bohr gathered together some of
the finest minds in the physics community, including Werner
Heisenberg  and George Gawow . During the 1920’s, the Institute
was the source of many important works in quantum mechanics
and in theoretical physics in general.Historical Note
Niels Bohr
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
24iv)   Bohr Model
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962)  proposed an atomic model in
which the electrons moved around the nucleus in circular paths called orbits . He
assumed the electrons to be moving around the nucleus in a circular orbit as the
planets move around the sun. Based on the Rutherford's  atomic model, Bohr made
the following modifications.
• The electrons in an atom can exist only in a restricted number of stable orbits
with energy levels in which they neither absorb nor emit energy. These orbitsdesignated by a number called the principal quantum number, n. The principal
quantum number  has the values of 1, 2, 3, . . . The energy levels are also called
shells . They are represented by K, L, M, . . . etc. The K-shell is the first shell,
the L-shell is the second shell, the M-shell is the third shell, etc.
• When an electron moves between orbits it absorbs or emits energy. When an
electron jumps from lower to higher states it absorbs a fixed amount of energy.When an electron falls from a higher (excited) state to a lower (ground) state itemits a fixed amount of energy.
• The electrons move around the nucleus  in energy levels.
Figure 1.10   The first six energy levels in the Bohr model of an atom.
• According to Bohr , for each element, the number of energy levels or shells is
fixed. Also, each different energy level or shell of an atom can only accommodatea certain number of electrons. The maximum number of electrons that the mainenergy level can have is given by the general formula 2n
2, where n is equal to
the main energy level.
Therefore, the maximum number of electrons in each shell in the Bohr  model is:
first energy level ( n = 1) is 2(1)2= 2 electrons
second energy level ( n = 2) is 2(2)2= 8 electrons
third energy level ( n = 3) is 2(3)2= 18 electrons
fourth energy level ( n = 4) is 2(4)2= 32 electrons
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
25It can also be summarized in the form of Table 1.4 .
Table 1.4   Energy levels and electrons for the first four main energy levels.
Principal quantum number  ( n) 1234
Shell KL M N
Maximum possible number of electrons 2 8 18 32
• When electrons fill the various energy levels in an atom, they first occupy the
shell with the lowest energy level. When the lowest energy level is filled, accordingto the 2n
2 rule, then the electrons enter the next higher energy level.
The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than eight electrons, even
if it has the capacity to hold more electrons. This is because having more than eightelectrons in the outermost shell makes the atom unstable.
For example, let us write the electron configuration of magnesium that has 12
electrons. The first 2 electrons occupy the K-shell (the first energy level). The L-shell(the second energy level) is occupied with 8 electrons. The remaining 2 electronsenter the M-shell (the third energy level). Hence, the electron configuration ofmagnesium atom becomes

Draw Bohr’s diagrammatic representations for the following atoms:
aNitrogen (atomic number = 7)
bSulphur (atomic number = 16)
cPotassium (atomic number = 19)
dCalcium (atomic number = 20)
v)  The Quantum Mechanical Model
During the 1920’s, the discovery of the wave-like properties of electrons led to the
wave-mechanical model or quantum-mechanical model  of atoms. In this model, the
electrons are associated with definite energy levels, but their locations cannot bepinpointed. Instead, they are described in terms of the probability of being found incertain regions of space about the nucleus. These regions of space are called orbitals .
An orbital is a particularly shaped volume of space where the probability of finding anelectron is at a maximum.
According to this model, the electrons in an atom are in a series of energy levels or
shells. Each energy level or shell is described by a number called the principal
quantum number, n, which is related to the size of the energy level. The larger the
energy value of n, the farther the electrons are found from the nucleus.
The quantum mechanical model introduces the concept of sublevel  for each main
energy level. For atoms of the known elements, there are four types of sublevelsdesignated by the letters s, p, d, and f. The number of sublevels within each energy
level or shell is equal to the numerical value of n.
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM

maximum number of electrons.

6P 6  ( s, p, d, f, g, h )7 2
Any orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. Accordingly,
s-sublevel has only 1 orbital and can hold a maximum of 2 electrons,
p-sublevel has 3 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 6 electrons,
d-sublevel has 5 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 10 electrons, and
f-sublevel has 7 orbitals and can hold a maximum of 14 electrons.
Electron Configurations
The arrangement of electrons in an atom is known as the electron configuration of the
atom . Because atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons, a
distinct electronic configuration exists for the atoms of each element. Like all systemsin nature, electrons in atoms tend to assume arrangements that have the lowest
possible energies. The lowest energy arrangement of the electrons in an atom is called
the ground state electron configuration . A few simple rules, combined with the
quantum number relationships discussed below, allow us to determine these ground-
state electron configurations.
The quantum mechanical model is designated by the following notation: a coefficient
which shows the main energy level, a letter that denotes the sublevel that an electron
occupies, and a superscript that shows the number of electrons in that particular
sublevel.
The designation is explained as follows

The configuration for sodium (23

are 2 electrons in the first s-sublevel, 2 electrons in the second s-sublevel, 6 electrons
in the second p-sublevel, and 1 electron in the third s-sublevel.

aPhosphorus (atomic number = 15)
bSulphur  (atomic number = 16)
cChlorine (atomic number = 17)

Rules Governing Electron Configuration
Most of the electronic configuration of an atom can be explained in terms of the building-up
principle, or also known as the Aufbau principle . According to the Aufbau principle, an
electron occupies the lowest energy orbital available before entering a higher energy orbital.
The atomic orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy.  The orbital with the lowest energy
is the 1s orbital. The 2s orbital is the next higher in energy, then the 2p orbitals, and so on.
Beginning with the third main energy level, n = 3, the energies of the sublevels in the differentmain energy levels begin to overlap.
In Figure 1.12 , for example, the 4s sublevel is lower in energy than the 3d sublevel.
Therefore, the 4s orbital is filled before any electrons enter the 3d orbitals. Less energy is
required for two electrons to pair up in the 4s orbital than for a single electron to occupy a 3d
orbital. Which sublevel will be occupied after the 3d sublevel is fully occupied?
The electrons are arranged in sublevels according to Aufbau principle which is also known as
the diagonal rule . The diagonal rule is a guide to the order of filling energy sublevels. It is
particularly helpful for atoms with atomic numbers higher than 18. This is because for atomswith higher atomic numbers their sublevels are not regularly filled.
Figure 1.12  Diagonal rule for writing electron configuration.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
30If you list the orbitals following the direction of arrows, you can obtain the electron
configuration of most atoms. Therefore, the order of filling the sublevels is given as:
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6...
The outermost occupied energy level of an atom is called the valence shell  and the
electrons that enter into these energy levels are referred to as valence electrons .
Example 1
What is the electron configuration of magnesium, 24
12Mg?
Solution:
24
12Mg = 1 s2 2s22p6 3s2   ﬁ in sublevel
2     8      2   ﬁ in main energy level
From this, we can write the configuration of elements by using a noble gas as
a core and the electrons outside the core. Note that noble gases have completeouter electron shells, with 2 or 8 electrons. Therefore, the above electronconfiguration can be written as follows:
24
12Mg = 1s22s22p6 3s2
[Ne]
= [Ne] 3 s2
Example 2
Write the electron configuration of copper (Z = 29).
Solution:      Following the diagonal rule, we can fill the sublevels, in order of increasing
energy, until all its electrons are filled. Therefore, the configuration will be:
Cu = 1 s

Unit Summary
The Greek philosopher Democritus  proposed what we consider as the first atomic
theory. He believed that all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles. Henamed the particles atoms  (meaning uncuttable or indivisible).
John Dalton’s  work in atomic theory marked the start of modern chemistry. His
concept of an atom was far more detailed and specific than Democritus'.
Dalton did not try to describe the structure or composition of atoms – he did not
know what an atom really looked like. But he did realize that the different propertiesshown by elements such as hydrogen and oxygen can be explained by assuming thathydrogen atoms are not the same as oxygen atoms.
In our current view of atomic theory, atoms consist of smaller particles – electrons ,
protons , and neutrons . The structure of an atom is basically a cloud of electrons
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
32surrounding a small, dense region, called the nucleus . An electron is a negatively
charged particle with negligible mass.
The nucleus was discovered by Ernest Rutherford . Rutherford suggested that the
charge and mass of an atom are concentrated in its nucleus, and that the nucleus haspositive charge.
In current views, the nucleus of an atom contains protons  and neutrons . Protons have
positive charge, and neutrons have no charge. Each element has a unique number ofprotons in its atoms. This number is the atomic number  of the element, and is
designated by Z. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom
is the mass number  of the element. Mass number is designated by A. Atomic number
and mass number for an atom of an element, X, is designated by:
A
Z X
For a neutral atom,
•the number of protons = the number of electrons = atomic number .
• the number of protons + the number of neutrons  = mass number.
Over centuries, scientists have developed these main atomic models:
•Dalton’s Model : an atom is a solid, indestructible sphere.
•Thomson’s Model : an atom is a sphere with a uniform positive charge. Negatively
charged electrons are embedded in the positive charge.
•Rutherford’s Model : Rutherford discovered that atoms are mostly empty space
with a dense, positive nucleus.
•Bohr’s Model : in an atom, electrons follow circular orbits around the nucleus.
The Bohr Model was the first quantum mechanical model of the atom.
•The Quantum Mechanical Model : in an atom, the orbits of electrons around
the nucleus are elliptical. This theory is a modification of the Bohr model.
The quantum mechanical description of an atom is the electron configuration  of the
atom – the arrangement of electrons in the atom. The maximum number of electrons ina main energy level is 2n
2, where n is the principal quantum number.
The quantum mechanical model is governed by this principle:The Aufbau principle  is a guide to the order of filling energy levels and sublevels.
According to this principle lower energy sub levels are completely filled beforeelectrons enter higher energy sublevels.

PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
37Activity 2.1
Form a group and discuss  the following concepts. Present your discussion to the rest of
the class.
What was the basis for the early attempts in classifying the elements? Outline the
contributions of some scientists you have read about in classfying the elements.
Before the beginning of the 18th century, it was easy to study and remember the
properties of the elements because very few were known.  However, in the middle ofthe 19
th century, many more elements were discovered. Scientists then began to
investigate possibilities for classifying the known elements in a simple and usefulmanner. After numerous attempts, the scientists were ultimately successful. Theygrouped elements with similar properties together. This arrangement is known as theclassification of elements .
Early Attempts in classifying the elements
What is meant by the term periodicity? Can you give some periodic events in
nature?
Early attempts to classify elements were based merely on atomic mass. Then scientists
began to seek relationships between atomic mass and other properties of theelements.
i)Dobereiner's Triads:   One of the first attempts to group similar elements was
made in 1817 by the German chemist J. Dobereiner.  He put together similar
elements in group of three or triads. According to Dobereiner , when elements in
a triad are arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses, the middle elementhad the average atomic mass of the other two elements. For example, becausethe atomic mass of bromine is nearly equal to the average atomic mass ofchlorine and iodine, he considered these three elements to constitute a triad when
arranged in this order: chlorine, bromine, iodine see Table 2.2.
Table 2.2 Dobereiner's Triads.

Do you think that this classification works for all elements?
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
38ii)Newlands's Law of Octaves:   In 1864, John Newlands , an English chemist,
reported the law of octave , which is also known as the law of eight .  He stated
that when elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic masses,
every eighth element had similar properties to the first element.
Newlands first two octaves of eight elements are shown below:
Li Be B C N O F
Na Mg Al Si P S Cl
KC a
However, the law of octaves could not be applied beyond calcium.

While attempting to group the elements according to their
chemical properties and atomic weights, Dimitri Mendeleev
developed the periodic table and formulated the periodic law.
Because his classification revealed recurring patterns (periods) in
the elements, Mendeleev was able to leave spaces in his table for
elements that he correctly predicted would be discovered.
Dimitri MendeleevHistorical NoteActivity 2.2
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
402.2.1 The Periodic Law
A. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law
In 1869, the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev  and the German scientist Luthar
Meyer  independently published periodic arrangements of the elements based on
increasing atomic mass.
Mendeleev observed that, when elements are arranged according to increasing atomic
mass, the chemical and physical properties of the elements recur at regular intervals.This periodic variation and the recurrence of the properties of the elements led to theformulation of the Periodic Law .
Mendeleev's periodic law  states that the properties of the elements are periodic
functions of their atomic masses. Only 63 elements were known when Mendeleev
constructed his table in 1871. Mendeleev  organized his table in columns, with each
column containing elements that have similar chemical properties. Accordingly,elements in the same column gave family or groups of elements.
How did Mendeleev know where to leave gaps for undiscovered elements in his
periodic table?
Mendeleev left blank spaces for the undiscovered elements and also predicted masses
and other properties of these unknown elements almost correctly.  For example,neither gallium nor germanium were discovered when Mendeleev  constructed his
periodic table.  But he predicted the existence and properties of these unknownelements.
Mendeleev left two blank spaces for these two elements in the table, just under
aluminium and silicon.  He called these unknown elements ' eka-aluminium ' and ' eka-
silicon .' ('eka' means ' first'). What he meant by ' eka-aluminium ' is "a currently known
element (galium) following aluminium".
Later on, in 1874, the element Gallium ( eka-aluminium  in Mendeleev's  system) was
discovered. In 1886, the element Germanium ( eka-silicon ) was discovered. The
observed properties of these elements were remarkably very close to those inMendeleev’s  predictions. Table 2.3  shows the properties of eka-silicon  predicted by
Mendeleev  and compares them to the observed properties of Germanium.

Defects in Mendeleev's periodic table
1. Position of isotopes: The isotopes were not given separate places in Mendeleev's
periodic table.  Since elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses,the isotopes belong to different groups (because isotopes have different masses ).
2. Wrong order of atomic masses of some elements: When certain elements are
grouped on the basis of their chemical properties, some elements with higheratomic masses precede those with lower atomic masses.  For example, argon,with atomic mass of 39.95, precedes potassium with atomic mass of 39.1.
B The Modern Periodic Law
What was Mosley's contribution to the modern form of the Periodic Table?
In 1913, the English physicist Henry Mosley determined the atomic number of each of
the elements by analyzing their X-ray spectra. He observed that when each element
was used as a target in an X-ray tube, it gave out X-rays with a characteristicwavelength. The wavelength depends on the number of protons in the nucleus of theatom and was constant for a given element. By arranging the elements in order ofdecreasing wavelength, Mosley was able to assign atomic number to each element.The atomic number of every element is fixed, and it clearly distinguishes one element
from another.  ' No two elements can have the same atomic number .' For example,
atomic number 8 identifies the element oxygen. No other element can have atomicnumber 8.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
42Therefore, the atomic number of an element is the fundamental property that
determines the chemical behavior of the element.  The discovery of atomic number ledto the development of the modern periodic law. The modern periodic law states that:‘‘the properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers.’’ Thismeans that when elements are arranged according to increasing atomic number,elements with similar physical and chemical properties fall in the same group.
2.2.2 Characteristics of Groups and Periods
Many different forms of the periodic table have been published since Mendeleev'stime. Today, the long form  of the periodic table, which is called the modern periodic
table, is commonly in use. It is based on the modern periodic law. In the modernperiodic table, elements are arranged in periods and groups.
What are the basis for classifying the elements into groups and periods?
What are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of S
and Cl?
Periods: The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods  or
series .
Elements in a period are arranged in increasing order of their atomic numbers from left
to right.
There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table, and each period is represented by
an Arabic numeral: 1, 2 . . . and 7.
• Elements in the same period have the same number of shells.
• Periods 1, 2, and 3 are called short periods while periods 4, 5, and 6 are
known as long periods .
• Period 1 contains only 2 elements, hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and period 3
contain 8 elements each.
• Period 4 and period 5 contain 18 elements each. Period 6, the longest period,
has 32 elements. Period 7, which is an incomplete period, contains more than24 elements.Period 7 element is radioactive and/or an artificial element.
• Except for the first period, all periods start with an alkali metal and ends with a
noble gas.
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
43Table 2.4  The number of elements in a given period and the orbitals being filled.
Period number Orbitals occupied Number of elements
11 s 2
22 s, 2p 8
33 s, 3p 8
44 s, 3d, 4p 18
and so on
The position of an element in a given period can be determined by the number of
shells occupied with its electrons. Accordingly, the number of shell is equal to thenumber of period to which the element belongs.
Example
Electronic configuration of 23
11Na = 1s22s22p63s1 (2, 8, 1). Sodium has 3 main
shells. Hence, sodium is found in period 3.
What are the similarities and differences in the electron configuration of  F
and Cl?
Groups or families:  are the vertical columns of elements in the periodic table.  There
are 18 columns or groups in the modern periodic table.
• Group numbers are usually designated with the Roman numerals I to VIII each
followed by the letter A or B.
These are: IA . . . . . . . . . VIII A     Main groups  (A groups)
IB . . . . . . . . . VIIIB      Sub groups  (B groups)
• Elements in a given group have the same number of outermost shell electrons.• Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties.
• For the main group elements the group number equals the number of valence
electrons.
Example
Electronic configuration of 35
17Cl = 1s22s22p63s23p5 (2, 8, 7). The number of
valence electrons of chlorine is 7. Hence chlorine is found in Group VIIA.

Perform the following tasks in groups and present your conclusion to the class.
For the following elements, determine the valence electrons, and identify the sub–shell
(s, p, d or f) in which the last electron of each element enters.

cSilicon (atomic number = 14)
dIron (atomic number = 26)
eZinc (atomic number = 30)
fKrypton (atomic number = 36)
gCerium (atomic number = 58)
Elements in a periodic table can be classified into three distinct categories based on
their electron configuration and the type of sub-level being filled. These are therepresentative elements, the transition elements, and the rare-earth elements.
1. Representative Elements: s-and p-block elements
These are elements in which valence electrons are filling the s- or p-orbitals .
Representative elements are also known as Main Group Elements . They include
elements in groups IA through VIIIA.
s-block elements  are elements in which the last electron enters the s-orbital  of the
outermost shell. Their general valence shell configuration is ns
1 and ns2, where n
represents the outermost shell.  They are found on the left side of the periodic tableActivity 2.3
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
46and contain the first two groups: Group IA and Group IIA.  These two groups
contain very reactive metals.
p-block Elements  are elements in which the last electron enters the p-orbital  of the
outermost shell. They have the general valence shell electron configuration of ns2np1–
ns2np6. p-block  elements are located at the right hand side of the periodic table and
they include six groups-Group IIIA to VIIIA. Most of these elements are non-metals.

Why is helium classified as a noble gas?
2. Transition Elements: d-block elements
These elements are found in the periodic table between the s-block and p-block
elements. In these elements, the valence electrons are being added to the d-orbital  of
the outermost shell. They are also known as d-block elements .  They are designated
as 'B' group, and they consist of groups IB – VIIIB. The transition elements are foundin periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. They include common elements such as iron, gold, andcopper. d-block elements are also called transition metals .
3. Rare-Earth Elements: f-block elements
These elements are also known as inner-transition elements .  They are elements in
which the last electrons are being added to the f-orbital  of the outermost shell. The
inner transition elements are in periods 6 and 7. The period 6 inner transition seriesfills the 4f-orbitals . It is known as the Lanthanide series  because it occurs after the
element lanthanum and its elements are similar to it.  The period 7 inner transitionseries fills the 5f-orbitals  and appears after the element actinium. Its elements are
similar to actinium, thus it is known as the Actinide series .s-block

Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• explain the general trends in properties of the elements as they move down a
group of the periodic table;
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9

Activity 2.4• explain the general trends in properties of elements across a period;
• deduce the properties of an element from its position in the periodic table; and• make a chart to show the trends in properties of elements in the periodic table.
Refer any chemistry book and look up values for atomic size, ionization energy,
electronegativity and other properties of elements. Enter the values in the periodic table,and see if there any obvious trends in the properties as you go across a period or down a
column of the table. Report your findings to the class.
In the periodic table the properties of the elements such as atomic size, ionization
energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity show a regular variation with in a groupor across a period.
2.3.1 Periodic Properties within a Group
Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and also
exhibit similar chemical properties.  For example, group IA elements have 1 valenceelectron; those in Group IIA have 2 valence electrons, and so on. Generally, it ispossible to conclude that the number of valence electrons determines the groupnumber of an element.
Table 2.6 Electron configuration and number of valence electrons of Group IA elements.
Element Electron Number of Group Number

Na 2, 8, 1 1
K 2, 8, 8, 1 1 IA
Rb 2, 8, 18, 8, 1 1
Cs 2, 8, 18, 18, 8, 1 1
The periodic properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of nuclear
charge and effective nuclear charge.
Nuclear charge ( Z): is the total positive charge in the nucleus of an atom.
Effective Nuclear charge ( Zeff): In an atom, the outermost shell electrons (or
valence electrons) are attracted to the nucleus and simultaneously repelled by the innershell electrons. The attraction of the nucleus for the valence electrons is also reducedbecause inner electrons shield (or screen) the valence electrons. As a result, these
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
49inner electrons reduce the attraction of the nuclear charge. The resulting net-positive
nuclear charge attracting the valence electrons is called effective nuclear charge , Zeff.
Effective nuclear charge relates the nuclear charge to the number of shells (size) of the
atom.
The effective nuclear charge is the difference between the nuclear charge ( Z) and the
inner electrons ( S) that shield the valence electrons. The effective nuclear charge is
always less than the actual nuclear charge.
Zeff = Z – S
Let us consider the sodium atom with its 11 electrons: 1s22s22p63s1 (2, 8, 1).  The 10
inner electrons of sodium completely cancel the 10 units of nuclear charge on thenucleus. In this way, the inner electrons shield the valence electrons from the fullattractive force of the nucleus and leave an effective nuclear charge of + 1 ( Z
eff= + 1).
The fact that the inner electrons shield or screen the outer electrons from the full
charge of the nucleus is known as shielding  or screening effect .
Form a group and perform the following task:
Draw Bohr's model for the following elements and indicate the shielding shells, shielding
electrons and effective nuclear charge:
aberyllium, magnesium and calcium;
blithium, carbon and fluorine.
Present your findings to the class.
The following properties of elements vary in a regular periodic manner.
1. Nuclear Charge
On moving down a given group of the periodic table, nuclear charge progressively
increases, but effective nuclear charge remains nearly constant.
2. Atomic Size/Atomic Radius
Where in a group do you find atoms with the largest atomic radius? Why?
It is difficult to measure the size of an atom directly. The electron cloud enveloping the
nucleus does not have a clear boundary because its electrons do not have fixeddistances from the nucleus. Therefore, atoms do not have definite outer boundaries.
The size of an atom is defined in terms of its atomic radius. For metals, atomic radius
is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of the two adjacent atoms. ForActivity 2.5
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
50Activity 2.6
elements that exist as diatomic molecules (such as chlorine), atomic radius is equal to
one-half of the distance between the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule. Figure 2.2
illustrates the atomic radius of chlorine in a chlorine molecule.

In moving down a group, atomic radius of the elements mainly depends on the
number of shells.

radii corresponding to the symbols of the elements.
2.explain the reason for the observed trend.

3. Ionization Energy
In which region of the periodic table do you find elements with the:
a lowest tendency to lose electrons, and
b highest tendency to lose electrons?
Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove the outermost shell
electron from an isolated gaseous atom or ion.
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
51Activity 2.7Ionization energy is represented by the following equation ( where M denotes any
metal ).
M (g) + energy –––– →M+ (g) + e–
The electrons in an atom can be successively removed, one after another. Thus, the
first ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the first valence electron, thesecond ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the second valence electron,and so on.
M (g) + energy ––––→ M
+ (g) + e–⇒ First ionization energy
M+ (g) + energy ––––→ M2+ (g) + e–⇒ Second ionization energy
For a given element, the second ionization energy is higher than the first one.Ionization energy is always a positive value (and therefore is an endothermic process)
because energy is required to remove an electron from an atom. Ionization energy ismeasured in electron volts ( eV) or kiloJoules per mole ( kJ/mol ).
Ionization energy is a measure of the tendency of an atom to lose an electron. Metals
easily lose electrons and thus have low ionization energy. Non-metals have highionization energy because they do not easily lose electrons.
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
Rank each set of the following elements in order of decreasing ionization energy and
explain the trend in ionization energy of the elements down a group.
i) Ca,  Sr,  Mg,  Be
ii) K,  Li,  Rb,  Na
iii) Cl,  F,  I,  Br
Generally, ionization energy is affected by the following factors:
i) Atomic size:  As atomic size increases, the valence electrons are less tightly
held by the nucleus. Thus, less energy is required to remove these electrons.
For example, the energy needed to remove an electron from a cesium atom is
lower than from a lithium atom.
ii) Effective nuclear charge:  The smaller the effective nuclear charge of an atom,
the lower is the energy needed to remove an electron from the atom.
iii) Types of electrons:  The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the more difficult
it is to remove the electron. In a given energy level, s-electrons are closer to
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
52the nucleus than p-electrons. Similarly, p-electrons are closer than d-electrons,
and d-electrons are closer than f-electrons. Hence, ionization energy
decreases in the order of:  s > p > d > f.
iv) Screening effect by the inner electrons:  As described earlier, inner shell
electrons shield the valence electrons from the nuclear charge. The more innerelectrons there are, the higher the screening effect, and therefore the easier itis to remove the valence electrons. Screening decreases ionization energy.
v) Electron configuration (stability):  It is easier to remove electrons from unstable
sublevels than from stable ones. Half-filled ( p
3,  d5, f7) and completely-filled
(d10, p6, f14) sublevels are more stable. For example, more energy is
required to remove a p3 electron than a  p4 electron. As a result of it,  the first
ionization energy of nitrogen is higher than that of oxygen.
Generally, with the increasing atomic number, the first ionization energy decreases
down the same group.
Activity 2.8
After studying the given information, identi fy the elements represented by X, M, and Y;
discuss the findings in your group, and then share your conclusion with the other groups.

 has a very low ionization energy.
 is in the fourth period of the periodic table.

4. Electron Affinity (EA)
To which group it is easier to add electrons; alkali metals or halogens?
Non-metals gain electrons and therefore form negative ions. The tendency of an atom
to form a negative ion is expressed in terms of electron affinity ( EA).
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS
53Electron affinity is defined as the energy released in kilojoules/mole, when an electron
is added to an isolated gaseous atom to form a gaseous ion.  It is a measure of theattraction or ‘affinity’ of the atom for the extra added electron.
X(g) + e
– ––––→ X– (g) + energy
Since energy is liberated during the process, electron affinity is expressed as a
negative value.  For example, when an electron is added to a fluorine ( F) atom, 328
kJ/mol of energy is released to produce a fluoride ion ( F–), and EA is – 328 kJ/mol.
F(g) + e– ––––→ F– (g) + EA = – 328 kJ/mol
Electron affinity is a measure of the strength of an atom to attract an additional
electron. The smaller  is the atomic size of an element, the stronger  is the tendency to
form negative ions, and consequently the higher the electron affinity. Generally,electron affinity depends on atomic size and effective nuclear charge of the elements.
Activity 2.9
Form a group and discuss the following concepts.
1.Why does the electron affinity of Cl is higher than that of F?
2.Explain why noble gases have extremely low (almost zero) electron affinities?
3.Explain why halogens have the highest electron affinities?
Present your findings to the class.
5. Electronegativity
Where do you find the most electronegative element in the periodic table?
Electronegativity is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract the shared electrons
in the chemical bond. The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901-1994)  developed
the most widely used scale of electronegativity values based on bond strength. ThePauling scale ranges from 0.7 to 4.0. Fluorine, the most electronegative element, is
assigned a value of 4.0, and the least electronegative element, cesium, has anelectronegativity value of 0.7.  The electronegativity values for all the rest elements liebetween these extremes.
The electronegativity of an atom is related to its ionization energy and electron affinity.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
54Activity 2.11
Activity 2.10
An atom with high ionization energy and high electron affinity also tends to have a high
electronegativity value because of its strong attraction for electrons in a chemicalbond.

6. Metallic Character
In which region of the periodic table do you find metals and non-metals?
Metals have the tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions.  As a result, metals
are called electropositive elements .
In moving down a group, atomic size increases progressively, and it becomes easier
for elements to lose their valence electrons and form positive ions. Therefore, metalliccharacter increases down a group.
In the periodic table, metals and non-metals are separated by a stair step diagonal
line, and elements near this border line are called metalloids . Metals are found on the
left side of the line and nonmetals on its right side.

2.3.2 Periodic Properties within a Period
Form a group and draw a rough sketch of the periodic table ( no details are required ). Based
on this, perform the following activities and present your findings to the class.
1. Indicate the regions where metals, non-metals, and metalloids are located in the
periodic table. ( Use different colours ).
2. Where do you find the most active metal and the most active non-metal? .
As we move from left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons of the
elements increases.  But the number of energy levels or main shells remains the samein a given period and electrons are filling the same energy level until stable noble gasconfiguration is achieved. The additional electrons from Li (2, 1) to Ne (2, 8) areadded to the second shell. In fact, the period number equals the number of energylevel being filled.

Let us now consider periodic properties of elements across a period.
1. Atomic Size:  From left to right in a given period, nuclear charge or atomic
number progressively increases by one for every succeeding element. However,increasing number of valence electrons is being added to the same shell. Thisresults in an increase in effective nuclear charge.
Activity 2.13
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
The following values are given for atomic radii (in Å) of period 2 elements:

the period from Na to Ar.
2. Explain why the first ionization energy of:
i)aluminium is lower than that of magnesium.
ii)sulphur is lower than that of phosphorus.
(Hint:  Use sublevel configurations for the elements).
3. Electron Affinity:  The variation in electron affinity of elements in the same
period is due to changes in nuclear charge and atomic size of the elements.
A cross a period from left to right, electron affinity increases due to an increase
in effective nuclear charge. The elements show a greater attraction for an extraadded electron.
4. Electronegativity:  Across a period, a gradual change in nuclear charge and
atomic size determine the trends in the electronegativity of the elements.
Activity 2.15
Form a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.
The following values are given for electronegativity of period 3 elements:2.1, 0.9, 1.5, 3.0, 1.8, 2.5 and 1.2Based on the information given;
1. Draw a table of period 3 elements and fill with the appropriate electronegativity
values corresponding to the symbols of the elements.
2. Explain the reason for the observed trend.
5. Metallic character:  From left to right in a period, metallic character of the
elements decreases. Elements on the left end of a period have a higher tendencyto form positive ions. Those at the right end have a greater tendency to formnegative ions. In any period, elements on the left side are metals and those onthe right side are nonmetals.
Consider the following period-3 elements and observe how the elements become

2.4 ADVANTAGES OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• describe the advantages of periodic classification in studying chemistry.
Form a group and discuss the importance of the periodic table for predicting the atomic
size and ionization energy of the elements. Share your idea with the class.
Why do we need the classification of elements?
The main advantages of using the periodic table are:
1.The periodic table is useful for predicting the formulas of compounds. The
elements in a given group form compounds with the same atomic ratio
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
60because of their similar electron configuration. For example, if the chemical
formula of sodium oxide is Na2O, then we can predict the formulas of the
other oxides of alkali metals. These are Li2O, K2O, Rb2O, and Cs2O.
2.The periodic table is useful for predicting the physical and chemical properties
of elements. For example, radium is a rare and radioactive element andtherefore difficult to handle in many experiments. Since its properties can bepredicted from the general trends of group IIA elements, sometimes we donot need to analyze it directly.
3.The periodic table is also useful for predicting the behaviour of many
compounds. For example, oxides of the elements become more acidic acrossa period and more basic in character down a group. The trends in the oxidesof period-3 elements vary from strongly basic oxides to amphoteric and thenacidic oxides as we move across a period.

How do you account for the unexpected resemblance of the properties of
the following sets of elements: Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si?
In addition to the group and period relationships, the elements of s and p block
also exhibit diagonal relationship. On moving diagonally across the periodic table, the
elements show certain similarities. Though clear upon examination, these diagonal
relationships are far less pronounced than the similarities within a group.
Diagonal relationship is particularly noticeable in the elements of second and third
periods of the periodic table. The following illustrations show the diagonal relationship
between Li and Mg, Be and Al, and B and Si.

Objective of the Activity
Scientists have identified different types of attractive forces between atoms in forming
bonds. The strength of the forces relies on the types of bonds. For instance, incovalent bonds, the strength of the bonds depends on whether the bonds are

3.1  CHEMICAL BONDING
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• define chemical bonding;
• explain why atoms form chemical bonds.
Most of the elements are not found free in nature. Why do the elements exists in
combined form ? Discuss in group and present your findings to the class.
A chemical bond  is the attractive force that binds atoms together in a molecule, or a
crystal lattice.
After the periodic table and the concept of electron configuration were developed,
scientists began to develop ideas about molecules and compounds. In 1916,
G .N Lewis  concluded that atoms combine in order to achieve a more stable electron
configuration resulting in molecules or compounds.
Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875 - 1946) , introduced the theory of the
shared-electron-pair chemical-bond formation in a paper
published in the journal of the American chemical society. In
honor of this contribution, we sometimes refer to “electron-dot”structures as “Lewis structures” .
G.N. LewisHistorical Note
Activity 3.1
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
68As independent particles, atoms are at relatively high potential energy.  Nature, favors
arrangements in which potential energy is minimized. Most individual atoms exist in aless stable state than in their combined form.
When atoms form bonds with each other, they attain lower potential energy states.
This decrease in atomic energy generally results in a more stable arrangement of matter.When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, only their outer regions are in contact.In the process of the interaction, atoms achieve stable outermost shell configuration.For this reason, when we study chemical bonding, we are concerned primarily withthe valence electrons. As described in Unit 2 , valence electrons  are electrons that exist
in the outermost shell of an atom.
Form a group and discuss the following:
The following table shows elements of group VIIIA and their atomic numbers. In the space
provided fill the valence shell electron configuration and number of valence electrons forthe elements. In your discussion include why helium is placed in group VIIIA even thoughit has only 2 valence electrons.
Elements Atomic Valence-Shell Number of Valence
Number Electron Electrons
Configuration
Helium, He 2
Neon, Ne 10Argon, Ar 18Krypton, Kr 36Xenon, Xe 54Radon, Rn 86
Share your discussion with the rest of the class.
Noble gas atoms with eight electrons (except for, He) in the outermost shell are stable.
Thus, the ns2np6 electronic valence structure has maximum stability.  Atoms containing
less than eight electrons in their outermost shell are unstable.  To attain stability, theseatoms tend to have eight electrons in their valence shells. This leads to the explanationof the octet rule .  The rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose or share electrons until
there are eight electrons in their valence shell.
The type or characteristic of the resulting arrangement depends largely on the type of
chemical bonding that exists between the atoms. These are ionic, covalent , and metallic
bonds .Activity 3.2

3.2 IONIC BONDING
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• explain the term ion;
• illustrate the formation of ions by giving examples;• define ionic bonding;• describe the formation of an ionic bond;• give examples of simple ionic compounds;• draw Lewis structures or electron-dot formulas of simple ionic compounds;• explain the general properties of ionic compounds; and
• investigate the properties of given samples of ionic compounds.
Form a group and discuss each of the following concepts. Share your ideas with the class.
1.Why do some atoms easily lose electrons and others do not?
2.Sodium chloride, NaCl is a good conductor in the form of liquid state, but a non
conductor in the form of solid state.
When an atom either loses or gains electrons, it becomes an ion. An ion is an electrically
charged particles. Two different types of ions exist. These are the positive ions calledcations and the negative ions called anions .
The chemical properties of metals differ from those of non-metals. A metal has 1, 2,
or 3 electrons in its outermost shell. Metals tend to lose these electrons and becomepositively charged ions. For example, if a metal ( M) loses one electron, it becomes an
ion with a charge of +1.Activity 3.3
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
70However, if it loses two electrons it becomes an ion with a charge of +2:
A non-metal may have 4, 5, 6, or 7 electrons in its outermost shell. Non-metals tend
to gain electrons to form negatively charged ions. For example, if a non-metal ( X)
gains one electron, it becomes an ion with a charge of –1.
Note that hydrogen can form both a cation, H+ (hydrogen ion ) as in HCl, or an anion
H– (hydride ion ) as in NaH .
Metals in Group IA, the alkali metals, tend to lose one electron when they combine
with other elements, producing cations of +1 charge.  For example, Na and K each
lose one electron to form ions of +1 charge.
Na → Na++e–
sodium atom sodium ion
K → K++e–
potassium atom potassium ion
On the other hand, Group VIIA elements, the halogens, usually gain one electron and
produce an ion with –1 charge. For example, each Cl and Br atom accepts oneelectron to produce an ion with –1 charge.
Cl + e
–→ Cl–
chlorine atom chloride ion
Br + e–→ Br–

4.Sulphur (atomic number = 16)

bwrite the type of ions they form; and
cindicate the charges on the ions formed.
Present your findings to the class.
The following table relates the position of some elements in the periodic table to the ions
they normally produce.Note that the charge is the same for each ion in a given group orcolumn.
Table 3.1 Selected ions in the periodic table.
Ionic Bond formation
When two atoms combine, one of the atoms gains electrons and becomes an anion
and the other loses electrons to form a cation. When a cation and an anion are broughtclose to one another, an electrostatic force of attraction  is set up between them. This
force of attraction between oppositely charged ions is called an ionic bond . It is also
called an electrovalent bond . The bond is produced when electrons are transferred
from the outermost shell of a metal atom to the outermost shell of a nonmetal atom.
To illustrate ionic bonding, let us consider the formation of the bond between sodium
and chlorine. A sodium atom has 1 valence electron. In order to attain the electron
configuration of the nearest noble gas ( Ne), it has to lose its valence electron and
form a sodium ion ( Na
+). Chlorine has 7 valence electrons. By gaining 1 electron,
chlorine attains the electron configuration of argon ( Ar) and form a chloride ion ( Cl–).Activity 3.4
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
72In general, an ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electron from a metal to a
nonmetal- for example, sodium and chlorine.  Atoms that are bound together by an
ionic bond form ionic compounds. For example, Na+ and Cl– ions form sodium
chloride, NaCl . The transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine and the formation
of the ionic bond in sodium chloride is shown with the following shell diagrams.
Figure 3.3 Formation of sodium chloride.
Electron-dot  notation is often used to represent the outermost shell electron
configurations of the elements. These formulas, also called Lewis formulas , consist of
the symbol of the element plus dots equal to the number of valence electrons in theatom or ion. Since valence shells contain a maximum of eight electrons, electron-dotsymbols contain a maximum of eight dots. Electron-dot formulas of sodium and chlorine
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
73are shown below. Sodium is an alkali metal with one valence electron:
Na: 1s22s22p63s1
The Lewis symbol for sodium is Na•.
Chlorine is a halogen with seven valence electrons:
Cl: 1s22s22p63s23p5
The Lewis symbol for chlorine is Cl.
The formation of ionic bond can also be represented by using electron-dot formulas.
Therefore, the Lewis structure for the ionic compound sodium chloride will be
Cl Na  +–Cl Na+

The following table illustrates the formation of ionic bonds between representative metals
and non-metals. Careful observation indicates that, in each case, both the metal and
the nonmetal acquire a noble-gas configuration. The compounds formed in each caseare electrically neutral as the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges.

given procedure, by considering the example of NaCl:
1.Write the name of the metal (sodium).
2.Modify the last characters of the name of the non-metal (chlorine) to end it withide. (Chlor ide).

A summary of the general properties of ionic compounds:
1.Ionic compounds do not contain molecules. They are aggregates of positive ions
and negative ions. In the solid state, each ion is surrounded by ions of the oppositecharge, producing an orderly array of ions called crystal.

77Figure 3.4 Arrangement of ions.
2.At room temperature ionic compounds are hard and rigid crystalline solids.  This is due
to the existence of strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the ions.
3.Ionic compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. This is due to
the presence of strong electrostatic forces between the ions. These forces can
be overcome only by applying very large amounts of energy.
4.Ionic compounds can conduct electric currents when molten or in aqueoussolution. This is due to the presence of mobile ions in molten state or in solution.
However, ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state.

Share your ideas with the class.
Many molecules are formed when outermost shell or valence electrons are shared
between two atoms. This sharing of electrons creates a covalent bond .
Covalent bond formation can be illustrated by the sharing of electrons between twohydrogen atoms to form a molecule of hydrogen.
Figure 3.6 Sharing of electrons between hydrogen atoms in H2  molecule.
In the hydrogen molecule, each hydrogen atom attains the stable electron configuration
of helium.
In a covalent bond, each electron in a shared pair is attracted to the nuclei of both
atoms as shown in Figure 3.6.  The shared electrons spend most of their time between
the two nuclei. The electrostatic attraction between the two positively charged nucleiand the two negatively charged electrons hold the atoms in the molecule together. ThisActivity 3.7
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
79attractive force between positively charged nuclei of atoms and the shared electrons in
a molecule is known as covalent bond .
A molecule of hydrogen chloride is also formed by a pair of electrons shared between
the two atoms. Each atom in the molecule attains a stable electron configuration.
Figure 3.7 Hydrogen and chlorine share a pair of electrons in HCl.
The concept of Lewis formula representation can also be extended to covalent bonds.The Lewis structure for a covalent compound shows the arrangement of atoms in amolecule and all the valence electrons for the atoms involved in the compound. It isconventional to represent the non-bonding (lone pair) electrons by dots and the pairof electrons that are shared between atoms by a dash. For example, consider thehydrogen molecule:
The electron-dot formula of the hydrogen molecule is:
H• + •H → H
H
The covalent bond in hydrogen molecule is also written as H – H .
The formation of the covalent bond in hydrogen chloride is shown by the following
electron-dot formula. This formula must satisfy the octet rule (for chlorine) and thedoublet rule (for hydrogen). As shown in the illustration, these requirements are satisfied.The shared pair belongs to both of the atoms (hydrogen and chlorine) in the hydrogenchloride molecule. The resulting valence electron configuration provides two valenceelectrons to hydrogen and eight to chlorine.
The chlorine atom in the molecule has three pairs of electrons, which are not used forbonding. Pairs of electrons that is not used for bonding are called lone-pair electrons .
Pairs that are used for bonding are called bonding-pair electrons .
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
80Consider the fluorine molecule, F2. The electron configuration of fluorine is 2, 7.  Thus
each fluorine atom has seven valence electrons.  Accordingly, there is only one unpairedelectron on fluorine. Therefore, the formation of the fluorine molecule is represented as
Note that only two valence electrons participate in the formation of fluorine molecule.
The others are non-bonding electron (lone pairs).  Thus each fluorine atom in fluorinemolecule has three lone-pairs of electrons. The resulting molecule is a diatomic molecule .
A diatomic molecule consists of two atoms. All the other members of the halogenfamily form diatomic molecules in the same way as fluorine does.
The maximum number of covalent bonds that an atom can form can be predicted
from the number of electrons needed to fill its valence shell. For example, each memberof Group IV A elements has four electrons in its valence shell, and it needs four moreelectrons to achieve stable noble-gas electron configuration. Thus, it forms four covalentbonds for carbon in methane, CH
4 as shown below:
CHHH
HCH
HH Hor
Elements of Group V A need three additional electrons to achieve noble gas configuration
and they form three covalent bonds as shown below for nitrogen in ammonia NH3.

HHor HH
Similarly, elements of group VIA form two covalent bonds and Group VIIA elements
form single covalent bonds.
Types of Covalent Bonds
How do you compare the nature and strength of the bonds in H2, O2 and N2?
Atoms can form different types of covalent bonds. These are single bonds, double
bonds and triple bonds.
In a single bond two atoms are held together by one electron pair.
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
81How are the covalent bonds in H2, Cl2 and HCl formed?
Many covalent compounds are held together by multiple bonds . Multiple bonds are
formed when two or three electron pairs are shared by two atoms. If two atomsshare two pairs of electrons, the covalent bond is called a double bond . For example,
double bonds are found in molecules of carbon dioxide ( CO
2) and ethene ( C2H4).

3.3.1 Polarity in Covalent Molecules
Form a group and discuss the following idea:
The covalent bonds are formed by sharing of electrons. Compare covalent bonds formed
between atoms of the same elements and those formed between atoms of differentelements. (Example: H
2 and HCl).
Present your conclusion to the class.
A covalent bond is formed when electron pairs are shared between two atoms.  In
molecules like H2, in which the atoms are identical, the electrons are shared equally
between the atoms. A covalent bond in which the electrons are shared equally betweenthe two atoms is called a non-polar covalent bond .
H – H
In other words, a non-polar  bond is a covalent bond in which bonding electrons are
shared equally between identical atoms, resulting in a balanced distribution of electricalcharge.
In contrast, in the covalently bonded HCl molecule, the H and Cl atoms are of different
elements; therefore, they do not share the bonding electrons equally.
Activity 3.9
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
83A chemical bond in which shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of one
atom than the other is called a polar covalent bond , or simply a polar bond .
Polarity of bonds is caused by differences in the electronegativity  of the two atoms
forming the bonds. Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract the sharedelectrons in a chemical bond toward itself.
Elements with high electronegativity have a higher tendency to attract electrons than
elements with low electronegativity. For example, in the case of HCl, the electronegativity
of the chlorine atom is higher than that of the hydrogen atom. The shared pair ofelectrons is more strongly attracted to the nucleus of the chlorine atom. As a result,the chlorine atom acquires a partial negative charge ( δ
–) whereas the hydrogen atom
acquires a partial positive charge ( δ+). The delta is read as "partial" or "slightly."
If a molecule has a positive end and a negative end, it is said to be polar and posses
a dipole. Dipole means 'two poles'.
Experimental evidence indicates that, in the HCl molecule, the electrons spend more
time near the chlorine atom. We can think of this unequal sharing of electrons as apartial electron transfer or a shift in electron density as shown below:
This unequal sharing of the bonding electron pair results in a relatively higher electrondensity near the chlorine atom and a correspondingly lower electron density nearhydrogen.

asingle bond, b double bond, and c triple covalent bond?

3.3.2 COORDINATE COVALENT BOND
A covalent bond in which one atom donates both electrons of the bond is called a
coordinate covalent bond . It is also called a dative bond . Such a bond is hypothetically
represented as:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
84Once formed, a coordinate covalent bond has the same properties as any other covalent
bond. The atom that contributes both electrons for the bond is the donor atom, andthe atom that shares the electron pair is the acceptor atom.
For an atom to act as a donor, it must contain lone pair of electrons in its valence
shell and the acceptor atom must have at least one vacant orbital.
For example, the ammonium ion, NH
+
4, is formed by a coordinate covalent bond in
which the two non-bonding electrons on NH3 bond with a hydrogen ion, H+, which
has no electrons to contribute.
In the resulting ion, NH+
4, the four N – H  bonds are identical.
Similarly, a coordinate covalent bond can be formed between a hydrogen ion and a
molecule of water, which has two lone pairs of electrons.
Carbon monoxide, CO, also has a coordinate covalent bond. In order for both carbon
and oxygen atoms to attain noble-gas electron arrangements, oxygen donates a pair ofelectrons to the carbon atom. In the process a coordinate covalent bond is formedbetween the two atoms.
General properties of covalent compounds
1.Covalent compounds are generally liquids or gases at ordinary temperature. For
example : water and ethyl alcohol are liquids. Hydrogen chloride, methane and
cabon dioxide are gases. Same covalent compounds are solids ( e.g. sugar)
2.As compared to ionic compounds, covalent compounds have relatively lower
melting points and boiling points.
3.They do not conduct electric current when molten or in aqueous solution, because
they consist of molecules rather than of ions.
4.Covalent compounds are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. They are
soluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride.

• explain the formation of metallic bond;
• explain the electrical and thermal conductivity of metals in relation to metallic
bonding; and
Activity 3.11
Form a group and discuss the following concepts and present your discussion to the class.
aMetals are solids. They contain large number of atoms in their crystals. What kind of
force do you think holds these metal atoms together?
bHow do you account for the properties of metals, such as conductivity, malleability, and
ductility in terms of the bonds in metals?
The highest energy orbitals of most metals are occupied by very few electrons. In
s-block metals, for example, one or two valence electrons occupy s orbitals in the
outermost levels (for example Na and Mg). Furthermore, the p orbitals of the outer
most level are also occupied partially in p-block metals (example Tl, Pb and Bi).
The d-block metals contain partially filled (n–1)d levels in their atomic states or principal
oxidation states. The bonding in metals is different from that in other types of crystals.
The valence electrons of metals are not held by individual atoms. Rather, they are
delocalized and mobile (free to move throughout the structure).
The valence electrons form a sea of electrons around the metal ions and these metal
ions are organized as a crystal. Metallic bonding results from the attraction between
the metal ions and the surrounding sea of electrons.
For example, as illustrated in Figure 3.8 , a sodium metal crystal is a lattice-like array
of Na+ ions surrounded by a sea of mobile bonding valence electrons.
Figure 3.8 Metallic bonding in sodium metal.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
88The bonding valence electrons move freely throughout the entire crystal. This freedom
of movement is responsible for the electrical conductivity of metals.
Properties of Metallic BondingHave you ever visited a goldsmith workshop? Why are metals easily shaped into
thin sheets and drawn into wires?
The freedom of movement of bonding valence electrons is responsible for the high
electrical and thermal conductivity that characterizes the metals. Other properties ofmetallic bonding contribute to unique properties of metals. For example, most metalsare easy to shape due to their malleability  and ductility .
Malleability  allows a substance such as a metal to be reshaped. By hammering and
bending some metals, you can create thin sheets. Ductility  allows a substance to be
drawn or pulled out into long thin pieces, such as wires.
Metals are malleable and ductile because metallic bonding is the same in all directions
throughout the solid.
When we apply a force to metal, its cations swim freely within the sea of electrons
without breaking the crystal structure. For example, when you hammer, bend, or pullon a metal to reshape it, you shift its cations around. The force you apply moves theatoms around, for example, around corners in the lattice. This is the basis for malleabilityand ductility of metals, which allows you to change its shape.
Model of a Metallic Crystal
Put about one hundred balls (for example, marble balls or balls made from other locally
available materials) into a rectangular glass trough. Shake the trough. Allow the balls tosettle.
aDraw a two-dimensional diagram to show how the marble balls are now arranged in
the trough.
bIf the balls represent atoms in a metallic lattice, which species are occupying the
‘empty’ space between and around them?
Present your model and findings to the class.

Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• define inter-molecular forces;
• explain hydrogen bonding;
• explain the effects of hydrogen bonding on the properties of substances;
• describe Van der Waal's forces;• explain dipole-dipole forces;
• give examples of molecules with dipole-dipole forces;
• explain dispersion forces;• give examples of molecules in which dispersion  force is important; and
• compare and contrast the three types of intermolecular forces.
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon: Why do covalent compounds
usually exist as gases and liquids?
Share your views with the rest of the class.
Inter-molecular forces  are relatively weak forces of attraction that occur between
molecules. Inter-molecular forces vary in strength but are generally weaker than thebonds that join atoms in molecules, ions in ionic compounds, and metal atoms in solidmetals. Inter-molecular forces acting between molecules include: dipole-dipole forces ,
London dispersion forces  and hydrogen bonding . Dipole-dipole attractions and
London forces are collectively called Van der Waal's forces .
ADipole-Dipole Forces
Dipole-dipole forces are strong inter-molecular forces between polar molecules. A dipole
is created by equal but opposite charges separated by a short distance. A polar moleculeacts as a tiny dipole because of its uneven charge distribution.
A dipole is represented by an arrow with a head pointing toward the negative pole
and crossed tail situated at the positive pole. The dipole created by a hydrogen chloridemolecule, which has its negative end at the more electronegative chlorine atom, is asshown below:
Figure 3.9 Dipole-dipole interactions in HCl molecules.Activity 3.12
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
90The negative end in one polar molecule attracts the positive end in an adjacent molecule
in a liquid or solid. Dipole-dipole forces occur in molecules such as ethyl alcohol andwater.
BLondon Dispersion Forces
All molecules, including those without dipole moments, exert forces on each other. We
know this because all substances, even the noble gases, change from liquid to solidstate under different conditions.
Figure 3.10  Induced dipole-induced dipole forces between non-polar molecules.
London dispersion forces  act between all atoms and molecules. They are the only
forces that exist between noble gas atoms and non-polar molecules. This fact is reflectedin the low boiling points of noble gases and non-polar molecules. Because dispersionforces result from temporary redistribution of the electrons causing induced dipole-dipole interactions, their strength increases with the number of electrons in the interactingatoms or molecules. Hence, dispersion forces increase with atomic number or molarmass. This trend can be seen by comparing the boiling points of gases (helium, He,
and argon, Ar), (hydrogen, H
2, and oxygen, O2), and (chlorine, Cl2, and bromine,
Br2).
As an illustration, the boiling points of the noble gases are presented in Table 3.4.

Ne -246 10
Ar -186 18
Kr -152 36
Xe -107 54Rn -62 86
CHEMICAL BONDING AND INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
91As you look down the column of noble gases, you note that boiling point increases.
This is because the induced dipole-dipole interaction increases.
CHydrogen Bonding
Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of intermolecular force arising when a hydrogen
atom is bonded to highly electronegative elements, fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen.Hydrogen bonding is a particular type of dipole-dipole interactions  between polar
compounds. In such compounds, large electronegativity differences between the hydrogenand the fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atoms make the bonds connecting them highlypolar. This polarity gives the hydrogen atom a positive charge. Moreover, the smallsize of the hydrogen atom allows the atom to come very close to an unshared pair ofelectrons on an adjacent molecule.  Hydrogen bonding is responsible for the unusualhigh boiling points of some compounds such as hydrogen fluoride ( HF), water ( H
2O)
and ammonia ( NH3).
Hydrogen bonds are usually represented by dotted lines connecting the hydrogen atom
to the unshared electron pair of the electronegative atom to which it is attracted.  Forexample, the hydrogen bond in hydrogen fluoride, HF, results when the highlyelectronegative F atom attracts the H atoms of an adjacent molecule.
Do you think that the intermolecular forces between molecules containing C-H,N-H, and O-H bonds are as strong as the intermolecular forces containing F-Hbonds?

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
97Chemical reactions  are the basis of chemistry. Chemical reactions occur around us all
the time. For example, the burning of fuel, the souring of milk, metabolic processes ofour body and the decay of plants are some familiar chemical reactions in daily life.
A chemical reaction is the process in which reacting substances, called reactants , are
converted to new substances, called products . The characteristics of the products are
completely different from those of the reactants. The conversion process is a chemical
change .
Reactants  Æ  Products
For example, if you burn magnesium with oxygen, the magnesium and oxygen are
completely converted to magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is a soft, white,
crumbling powder. These characteristics of magnesium oxide are completely differentfrom the characteristics of the original substances, magnesium and oxygen. Magnesiumand oxygen are no longer present in the elemental form.
In summary, a chemical reaction  has occurred in which the reactants , magnesium and
oxygen, underwent a complete chemical change , giving the product magnesium oxide.
All chemical reactions include three types of changes in the original substances. These
are changes in composition, properties and energy.
Form a group and perform the following task.
List some chemical processes that occur in your daily life. Identify the reactants and
products in each of these chemical processes.
Present your findings to the class.
Note that, in daily life, we use different terms for the same process of chemical
change. For example “the souring of milk” occurs due to the process of fermentation.
In scientific discussion we generally have a single term for each process.
4.2  FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Competencies

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
98The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a
chemical reaction.  In other words, the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to themass of the products, within the limits of experimental error. This law is also known as
the law of indestructibility of matter .
Mass of reactants = Mass of products
There is no loss or gain of substances during a chemical reaction, and mass is
conserved.
For example, consider the decomposition of mercury (II) oxide. When 100 g of
mercury (II) oxide decomposes by heat, 92.6 g of mercury and 7.4 g of oxygen are
formed. Note that the total mass of mercury and oxygen after decomposition is 100 g:Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. When wood burns, the ash weighs
much less than the original wood. Where did the “lost mass” go? How can you estimate
the mass of the wood that is no longer present?
Present your conclusion to the class.
While investigating the quantitative relations between substances in chemical reactions,
scientists formulated the three basic laws of chemical combination. These are:
i) The law of conservation of mass
ii) The law of definite proportions
iii) The law of multiple proportions
i)  The Law of Conservation of Mass
In 1774, the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier performed an experiment in which he
heated a sealed glass container that held a sample of tin in air. He measured the mass ofthe substances before and after heating and found them to be the same. This and othersimilar experimental observations became the basis of the law of conservation of mass.
French chemist Antoine Lavoisier  is considered the founder of
modern chemistry. He found that the amount of matter before a
chemical reaction is equal to the amount of matter afterwards, even
though the matter may change in its form. Lavoisier  also
experimented with the role of oxygen in combustion and
respiration in both plants and animals.

Objective:  To determine the mass of substances before and after a reaction.
Apparatus:  Flask, test tube, thread, rubber stopper, balance.
Chemicals:  Sodium chloride, silver nitrate.
Procedure:
1.Take 50 mL of silver nitrate solution in a conical flask.
2.Tie a thread around the top of a test tube. Fill the test tube with a saturated
solution of sodium chloride. Suspend the test tube in the flask by means of athread held by a rubber stopper, as shown in Figure 4.1 .

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
100ii)  The Law of Definite Proportions
The law of definite proportions states  that a compound always contains the same
elements in the same proportion by mass.  This means that all pure samples of acompound have the same composition regardless of the source of sample.  This law isalso known as the law of constant composition . For example, sample of water could
be obtained from different sources, such as from a river, the ground, or the ocean.But whatever the original source, all forms of pure water contains 11.2% hydrogenand 88.8% oxygen by mass. These percentages represent a ratio of 1.0 to 8.0 (1:8),by mass, of hydrogen to oxygen.
This ratio is constant (fixed) for water. In other words, a compound with a different
ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is not water.
Similarly, in forming the compound ZnO, 65.0 g of zinc combines with 16.0 g of
oxygen. This is 80.2% zinc and 19.8% oxygen, by mass.  As is the case for water,the composition of ZnO is constant. In forming ZnO, zinc combines with oxygen in a
definite proportion.

decomposition)

iii)  The Law of Multiple Proportions
The law of multiple proportions  states that when two elements combine to form more
than one compound, the masses of one element combined with a fixed mass of thesecond element are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This law can be illustrated bythe two oxides of carbon. The two oxides of carbon are carbon monoxide (CO) andcarbon dioxide (CO
2). In CO2, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 2.67 g of oxygen;
whereas in CO, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 1.33 g of oxygen. By comparing2.67 g of oxygen with 1.33 g of oxygen, it is found that the masses of oxygen in thetwo compounds that combine with the same mass of carbon are in the simple wholenumber ratio, 2:1.

4.3  CHEMICAL EQUATIONS
Competencies
By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
• describe the conventions used to write chemical equations;
• balance chemical equations, using the inspection method;
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
103• balance chemical equations, using the Least-Common-Multiple (LCM) method.
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1.What is the difference between a chemical equation and a chemical reaction?
2.Which law is satisfied when a chemical equation is balanced? Take a simple chemical
reaction to illustrate this law.
Present your conclusion to the class.
A chemical equation  is a shorthand representation of a chemical reaction in terms of
chemical symbols and formulas. In a chemical equation the starting substances arecalled reactants ; and the new substances produced are known as products .
Reactants are written on the left side and products on the right side of the equation.
An arrow ( →) is placed between the two sides to indicate transformation of reactants
into products.
Reactants  Æ  products
4.3.1  Writing Chemical Equation
In writing chemical equation, instead of using words, chemical symbols and formulas
are used to represent the reaction.
Steps to Write a Chemical Equation
1.Write a word equation: A word equation is stated in words. For example, the
word equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine to produce sodiumchloride is written as:
Sodium + Chlorine  Æ  Sodium chloride ( word equation )
Note that we read the ' + ' sign as 'reacts with' and the arrow can be read as
'to produce', 'to form', 'to give' or 'to yield'.
2.Write the symbols and formulas for the reactants and products in the word
equation.
Na + Cl
2  Æ  NaCl ( Chemical equation )
3.Balance the equation.
2Na + Cl2  Æ  2NaClActivity 4.5
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
104Generally, any chemical equation must fulfil the following conditions:
i)The equation must represent a true and possible chemical reaction.
ii)The symbols and formulas must be written correctly. The elements– hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine exist as diatomic
molecules . These elements should be written as molecules in the equation.
iii)The equation must be balanced.
A chemical equation has both qualitative  and quantitative meanings .
Qualitatively, a chemical equation indicates the types of the reactants and products
in the reaction.
Quantitatively, a chemical equation expresses the relative number ( amount)
of moles, molecules or masses of the reactants and products.
4.3.2 Balancing Chemical Equation
Which should be adjusted in balancing a chemical equation, the subscripts or
the coefficients?
According to the law of conservation of mass, atoms are neither created nor
destroyed during a chemical reaction.  As a result, the number of atoms of eachelement should remain the same before and after the reaction. Therefore, the mainreason why all chemical equations must be balanced is just to obey the law ofconservation of mass.
To balance a chemical equation means to equalize the number of atoms on both sides
of the equation by putting appropriate coefficients in front of the formulas.
Only two methods of balancing chemical equations will be discussed under this topic.
These are the inspection  and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) method.
1.  The Inspection Method
Most simple chemical equations can be balanced using this method.  Balancing an
equation by inspection means to adjust coefficients by trial and error until the equationis balanced.  Follow the following four steps to balance the chemical equation.
Step 1:    Write the word equation.
Step 2:    Write the correct symbols or formulas for the reactants and products.
Step 3: Place the smallest whole number coefficients in front of the symbols or
formulas until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sidesof the equation.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
105Step 4: Checking:  By counting the number of atoms on both sides of the equation,
make sure that the atoms of all elements are balanced and also thecoefficients are expressed as the smallest whole number ratio.
Note:
When you balance an equation, do not change any symbol or formula of any compound.
If you change a symbol or formula, it no longer represents the element or compound
required by the equation.
Example 1
Balance the equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to
produces magnesium oxide.
Solution:
Step 1: Magnesium + Oxygen  Æ  Magnesium oxide
Step 2: Mg + O2  Æ  MgO ( unbalanced )
Step 3: Put coefficients to balance the equation
• Oxygen is not balanced. There are two oxygen atoms on the left side and
one on the right side. Hence, place the coefficient 2 in front of MgO.
Mg + O2  Æ  2MgO ( unbalanced )
• Now Mg is not balanced. There is one Mg on the left side and two on the
right side. Thus, place the coefficient 2 in front of Mg.
2Mg + O2  Æ  2MgO ( balanced )
Step 4: Checking:  There are two Mg and two O atoms on each side of the
equation. Therefore, the equation is correctly balanced.
2Mg + O2  Æ  2MgO
Exercise 4.2
Balance the following chemical equation, using the inspection method:
1. Na + H2O  Æ  NaOH + H2
2. CaCO3  Æ  CaO + CO2
3. H2O2  Æ  H2O + O2
4. Al + H3PO4  Æ  AlPO4 + H2
5. HNO3 + H2S  Æ  NO + S + H2O
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
1062.  The LCM Method
In the LCM method, the coefficients for the balanced chemical equation are obtained
by taking the LCM of the total valency of reactants and products and then dividing itby total valency of reactants and products. All the necessary steps to balance a
chemical equation by the LCM method, are shown by the following examples.
Example 2
When aluminium reacts with oxygen, aluminium oxide is formed. Write
the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.
Solution:
Step 1: Represent the reaction by a word equation.
Aluminium + Oxygen Æ  Aluminium oxide
Step 2: Change the words to symbols and formulas for the reactants and
products.
Al + O2  Æ  Al2O3
Step 3: Place the total valency of each atom above it.
34 6 6
22 3 Al O Al O +   Æ
Now the equation shows
•  The valency of aluminium as 3.•  The total valency of oxygen is 2 × 2 = 4.•  The total valency of aluminium in Al
2O3 is  3 ×  2 = 6.
•  The total valency of oxygen in Al2O3 is 2 × 3 = 6.
Step 4: Find the LCM of each total valency and place it above the arrow.

4.4  ENERGY CHANGES IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to :
• explain energy changes in chemical reactions;
• define endothermic and exothermic reactions;• describe endothermic and exothermic reactions;• illustrate endothermic and exothermic reactions using diagrams;• conduct simple experiment to demonstrate exothermic and endothermic reactions;
• describe the importance of chemical changes in production of new substances
and energy.
Form a group and discuss each of the following phenomena:
When the bread baked, does the bread absorb or release heat energy? Justify your answer.
Present your conclusion to the class.
Almost all chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes . These energy
changes could be in the form of heat energy, light energy, electrical energy, and so on.Activity 4.6
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
109On the basis of energy changes, chemical reactions can be divided into exothermic
and endothermic reactions .
4.4.1  Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
Can heat energy be considered as a reactant or product?
Exothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction that releases heat energy to the surroundings is known as an
exothermic reaction . During an exothermic process, heat is given out from the system
to its surroundings and this heat energy is written on the right side of the equation as
shown below.
Reactants  Æ  Products + Heat
For example, the burning of carbon with oxygen produces carbon dioxide and heat is
released during the reaction.  Thus, the reaction is exothermic and written as:
C + O2  Æ  C O2 + Heat
Endothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction which absorbs heat energy from the surroundings is known as an
endothermic reaction . During an endothermic process, heat flows into the system from
its surroundings and the heat is written on the left side of the equation.
Reactants  +  Heat  →  products
For example, the reaction between carbon and sulphur to form carbon disulphide is
an endothermic reaction because heat is absorbed in the reaction.
C + 2S + Heat Æ  C S2
The amount of heat energy liberated or absorbed by a chemical reaction is called heat
of reaction  or change in enthalpy  for the reaction. It is symbolized as ∆H.  Its unit is
expressed in kilojoules per mol ()kJmol. The change in enthalpy ( ∆H) is the difference
between the energy of the products and the energy of the reactants.
∆H = Hp – Hr; where Hp is the heat content ( energy ) of the product,  Hr is the
heat content ( energy ) of the reactant.
4.4.2  Energy Diagrams
For endothermic reactions, DH is positive because the energy of the product is higher
than the energy of the reactant. As a result, the enthalpy of the system increases asshown in Figure 4.3 .
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
110since,   Hp > Hr, DH = positive ( DH > 0)
For example, when nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide, 66.4 kJ of
heat energy is absorbed ( i.e., DH = + 66.4 kJ/mol) and thus the reaction is
endothermic.
N2 (g) + 2O2 (g)  Æ  2NO2 (g); DH = + 66.4 kJ/mol
Figure 4.3   Energy diagram for an endothermic reaction.
For exothermic reactions, DH is negative because the energy of the reactants is
greater than the energy of the products. Thus, the enthalpy of the system decreases,as shown in Figure 4.4 .
H
p < Hr  ﬁ  ∆H = negative ( DH < 0)
For example, when carbon burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, 393.5 kJ of
heat energy is liberated and hence the reaction is exothermic  (∆H = –393.5 kJ/mol).
C(s) + O2(g)  Æ  CO2(g):  DH = –393.5 kJ/mol

113Form a group and perform the following task.  In your daily life you encounter with many
chemical changes involving energy. List some of such changes and discuss their
importance.
Share your findings with the rest of the class.
Chemical reactions bring about chemical changes. All chemical changes are
accompanied by energy changes. This energy is usually in the form of heat, light, or
electricity.
Energy changes produced by chemical reactions have many practical applications
(uses). For example, energy lifts rockets, runs cars, and extracts metal from
compounds.
Many applications involve the energy produced by fuel combustion, which liberates
large amounts of heat. The energy can be converted from one form to another. For
example, the energy that fuel combustion produces can convert water to steam.
The steam can run a turbine that creates electricity.
Respiration (breathing) creates energy for our bodies. Breathing releases the energy
our living cells produce by oxidizing glucose. This energy helps to maintain our
body temperature and body exercises.

compound into two or more elements or simpler compounds. A decompositionreaction can be carried out using heat, light, electricity or a catalyst. But mostdecomposition reactions are carried out when heat is supplied and this heat energy isindicated by a ‘delta’ ( ∆) symbol above the arrow. The general form of equation for
a decomposition reaction is:
AB  Æ  A + B
where the reactant AB must be a compound and the products A and B could be
elements or compounds.
Examples
•Water is decomposed to hydrogen and oxygen gases when electricity is passed
through it.

A reaction in which one element displaces another element from its compound is
known as single displacement or replacement reaction . Such a reaction is represented
by the following two general forms.
A + BC  Æ  B + AC
If A is a metal, it will displace B to form AC, provided A is a more active metal
than B.
A + BC  Æ  BA + C
If A is a non-metal, it will displace C to form BA, provided A is a more active
non-metal than C.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
124The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced chemical
equation is known as stoichiometry . In other words, stoichiometry is the study of the
amount or ratio of moles, mass, energy and volumes (for gases) of reactants andproducts. Stoichiometric calculations are based on the following two major principles.
i)The composition of any substance in the chemical equation should be expressed
by a definite formula.
ii)The law of conservation of mass must be obeyed (the mass of reactants equals
the mass of products).
4.6.1  Molar Ratios in Balanced Chemical Equation
From a balanced chemical equation, it is possible to determine the:
•number of moles of each reactant and product; and
•relative mass of each of the reactants and products
For example, in the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water, 2 moles of
H2 combines with 1 mole of O2 to yield 2 moles of H2O. The equation also tells us
4 g of hydrogen reacts with 32 g of oxygen to produce 36 g of water. This can befurther interpreted as follows:
2H
2(g)     +   O2(g)    Æ    2H2O(l)
Mole  Æ   2 mole          1 mole          2 mole
Molecule  Æ   2 molecule      1 molecule      2 molecule
Mass  Æ   4 g             32 g           2 × 18 g
36 g reactant 36 g product
Calculations based on chemical equations ( stoichiometric problems ) are classified
into mass-mass problem, volume-volume problems and mass-volume problems.
4.6.2  Mass–Mass Relationships
In mass-mass problems , the mass of one substance is given, and the mass of the
second substance is determined from the same reaction.  There are two methods forsolving such types of problems:
i)Mass-ratio method
ii)Mole-ratio method
Let us see each method by using the necessary steps.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
125i)   The mass-ratio method
In this type of stoichiometric calculation, the mass of one substance is determined
from the given mass of the other substance using the following steps.
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Place the given mass above the corresponding formula, and x above the
formula of the substance whose mass is to be determined.
Step 3: Write the total molar mass of the substances below the formula of each
substance. ( Total molar mass is the molar mass of the substance
multiplied by its coefficient ).
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown mass, x.
Example 1
How many grams of calcium chloride are formed when 15 g of calcium metal
reacts with hydrochloric acid?

Step 5: x = 56.8 g
ii)  The mole-ratio method
The mole ratio is the ratio between the numbers of moles of any two substances in a
given reaction. In this method, the given mass is converted into moles, and the numberof moles for the required substance is calculated. If needed, convert the obtainedmoles back to mass.
Follow the steps given below to solve problems of mass-mass relationships by the
mole ratio method:
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Convert the given mass to moles and write the obtained moles and the
required quantity, x, above the formulas of the respective substances.
Step 3: Place the coefficients as the number of moles under the formula of each
substance involved.
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown value, x; and convert the moles obtained into mass.
Example 3
How many grams of sodium metal are needed to react with 10.0 g of water?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Na + 2H2O  Æ  2NaOH + H2
Step 2: moles of H2O = given mass 10.0 g  =
molar mass 18 g/mol = 0.56 mol

Therefore, 12.88 g of sodium metal is needed to react with 10 g of water.
Example 4
What mass of nitrogen dioxide is produced by the decomposition of 182 g of
magnesium nitrate?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Mg (NO3)2  Æ   2MgO + 4NO2 + O2
Step 2: moles of Mg (NO3)2 = 182 g
148 g/mol = 1.23 mol

reaction that produces 0.05 moles of O2?
6.How many moles of CaO are needed to react with excess water to produce
370 g of calcium hydroxide?
4.6.3  Volume-Volume Relationships
In reactions involving gases, the volume of gases can be determined on the principle
that 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 litres at STP ( standard
temperature and pressure , STP, the temperature is 0°C and the pressure is 1 atm ).
It is also known that 22.4 L of any gas weighs exactly its molecular mass at STP. Thisvolume, 22.4 litres, of a gas is known as the molar volume .
At STP, 1 mole of any gas = 22.4 L = gram volume mass of the gas
The relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro's law  states that equal volumes of different gases,
under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain equal number ofmolecules. This law can also be stated as the volume of a gas is proportional to thenumber of molecules (moles) of the gas at STP.

4.6.4  Mass–Volume Relationships
In mass-volume problems, either the mass of one substance is given and the volume
of the other is required or the volume of one substance is given and the mass of theother one is required. The steps to solve such type of problems are the same as theprevious steps except putting the masses on one side and the volumes on the otherside of the equality sign.

4.6.5  Limiting and Excess Reactants
When all the reactants are completely consumed in a chemical reaction, then such
reactants are said to be in stoichiometric proportions . But, practically these types of
chemical reactions do not always occur.  In many cases, an excess of one or more
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
132reactants is encountered in the reaction and the other reactant is completely converted
into products. Thus, the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction is known
as the limiting reactant , because it limits or determines the amount of products that can
be formed.
For example, consider the following reaction:
H2   +    C l2    Æ   2HCl
1 mole     1 mole       2 moles
According to the equation, 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2
mole of HCl. Thus, all the reactants are completely consumed and only products
appear. However if 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1.5 mole of Cl2, there is insufficient H2
to react with all of the Cl2. Therefore, Cl2 will be in excess and H2 will be the limiting
reactant. Only 2 moles of HCl are formed and at the end of the reaction 0.5 mole of
Cl2 remains unreacted.
Example 8
How much ammonia is produced if 10 g of hydrogen reacts with 18 g of
nitrogen?
Solution:
3H2(g) + N2(g) Æ  2NH3(g)
First determine the number of moles;
Moles of H2 = 10 g = 5 mol
2 g/mol
Moles of N2 = 18 g
28 g/mol= 0.64 mol
Now, calculate the number of moles or masses of the product that would be
formed by each reactant.
The reactant that gives the smallest amount of product is the limiting reactant.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
133Therefore, the limiting reactant is nitrogen, because it gives less amount of
NH3, i.e., 21.8 g NH3.  In the reaction, 0.64 mole (18 g) of N2 is consumed.
Hydrogen is in excess. The amount of hydrogen consumed will be:

Example 9
In the chemistry laboratory, a student performed a displacement reaction by
adding 9.5 g of zinc into 9.5 g of HCl in a beaker. What weight of ZnCl2 will
be produced?
Solution:
Zn + 2HCl  Æ  ZnCl2 + H2
Moles of Zn = 9.5 g
65 g/mol = 0.15 mol
Moles of HCl  = 9.5 g
36.5 g/mol = 0.26 mol
Even though the given masses of the two reactants are the same, they are not
mixed in equimolar ratio as shown above. Thus, the limiting reactant must be
determined first.

4.6.6  Theoretical, Actual and Percentage Yields
The measured amount of product obtained in any chemical reaction is known as theactual yield . The theoretical yield  is the calculated amount of product that would be
obtained if the reaction proceeds completely. The actual yield ( experimentally
determined yield ) of a product is usually less than the theoretical yield ( calculated
yield).
The percentage yield  is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield multiplied by
100.
Percentage yield = Acutal yield
Theoretical yield × 100

Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to :
• define redox reactions;
• define the terms oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer;• define oxidation number (oxidation state),
• state oxidation number rules,
• determine the oxidation number of an element in a given formula;• describe the oxidizing and reducing agents;• analyze a given redox reaction by specifying the substance reduced and the
substance oxidized, and also the oxidizing and reducing agents; and
• Distinguish between redox and non-redox reactions.
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon:
When you dry your meal dishes with a towel, the towel can be termed as a drying agent
and the dish as wetting agent. What happens to the towel and the dish, in terms of
getting wet and dry, after cleaning? Relate this idea with oxidizing agent and reducing
agent, oxidation and reduction of substances. Present your conclusion to the class.
In our day to day activity, we are familiar with the chemical processes like rusting of
iron, burning of substances, breathing of air, digestion of food and so on. All suchtypes of processes or reactions are known as oxidation and reduction  or redox
reactions .
4.7.1  Oxidation-Reduction
Can oxidation take place without reduction?
Oxidation:  is the process in which a substance loses electrons in a chemical reaction.
For example, in the reaction
2Na + Cl2  Æ  2NaClActivity 4.10
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
137Each sodium atom has lost one electron and has turned to a sodium ion.
Hence, sodium is oxidized.
Na + 1e–   Æ  N a+
Reduction: is the process in which a substance gains electrons in a chemical
reaction.
For example, in the above reaction each chlorine atom has gained an
electron and has changed to chloride ion. Thus, chlorine is reduced;
Cl2 + 2e–  Æ  Cl–
The processes of oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously because if one
substance loses electrons, the other substance must gain these electrons. Since theprocess of oxidation and reduction involves the transfer of electrons, it also results inthe changes of oxidation number. Thus, oxidation and reduction can also be defined interms of oxidation number. Oxidation is an increase in the oxidation number of anelement and reduction is a decrease in the oxidation number. For example, in the
reaction,
The oxidation number of sodium is increased from 0 to +1 and thus sodium is
oxidized. The oxidation number of chlorine is decreased from 0 to –1, and thereforechlorine is reduced.
4.7.2  Oxidation Number or Oxidation State
Oxidation number or oxidation state is the number of electrons that an atom appearsto have gained or lost when it is combined with other atoms.
Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Rule 1: The oxidation number of all elements in free state is zero. This rule is also
applied for diatomic or polyatomic elements.
Example:  The oxidation number of Na = 0, Cu = 0, Cl in Cl2 = 0, O in
O3 = 0, S in S8 = 0.
Rule 2: The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
Example:  Na+ = +1, Mg2+ = +2, S2–
= –2.
Rule 3: The oxidation number of oxygen in a compound is usually – 2 except in the
following cases:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
138Exceptions
The oxidation number of oxygen in:
i)peroxides is –1. Example:  Na2O2
ii)superoxides is –1/2. Example:  2KO
iii)oxygen diflouride is +2. Example:  2OF
Rule 4: The oxidation number of hydrogen in its entire compounds is +1 except
in metal hydrides, (like NaH, CaH2 and AlH3), where its oxidation
number is –1.
Rule 5: The sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a neutral compound is
zero.
Example:  +1 +6    -2
24HS O    ((+2) + (+6) + (–8) = 0)
Rule 6: In a polyatomic ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers of the constituent
atoms equals the charge on the ion.
Example:  +6 –2
–2
4(SO )    ((+6) + (–8) = –2)
Rule 7: Elements of group IA have +1 and group IIA have +2 oxidation states in all
of their compounds.
Rule 8: In a compound, the more electronegative element is assigned a negative
oxidation number, and the less electronegative element is assigned a positiveoxidation number.
Example :  +3 –1
3NC l (chlorine is more electronegative than nitrogen )
Example 1
What is the oxidation number of chromium in Na2Cr2O7?
Solution:
The oxidation number of O is –2 ( Rule 3 )
The oxidation number of Na is +1 ( Rule 7 )
Let the oxidation number of Cr be x.
+1 –2
22 7Na Cr Ox
Since the sum of the oxidation numbers of Na, Cr, and O in Na2Cr2O7 is 0
(Rule 5 )
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
139Then, +1 –2
22 7Na Cr Ox
(1 × 2) + ( x × 2) + (–2 × 7) = 0
2 + 2 x – 14 = 0
x= + 6
Therefore, the oxidation number of Cr in Na2Cr2O7 is +6.

The sum of the oxidation numbers of Mn and O in MnO4– is –1 ( Rule 6 )

Therefore, the oxidation number of Mn in MnO4– is +7.
Example 3
Determine the oxidation number of phosphorus in Ca(H2PO4)2.
Solution:
The oxidation number of Ca is +2 ( Rule 7 ).
Let, the oxidation number of P be x.
+2 +1  – 2

4.7.3  Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
In a redox reaction, the substance that causes another substance to get oxidized, but
itself gets reduced, is known as an oxidizing agent , or oxidant . In the same manner,
the substance that causes another substance to get reduced, but itself oxidized, isreferred to as a reducing agent  or reductant.
•Oxidizing agents  are substances that:
– are reduced ( gain electrons )
– contain elements whose oxidation number decreases
•Reducing agents  are substances that:
– are oxidized ( lose electrons )
– contain elements whose oxidation number increases
Tests for an oxidizing agent are accomplished by mixing it with a substance which is
easily oxidized to give a visible colour change when the reaction takes place.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
141For example,
i)Permanganate ion (MnO4–) in acidic solution changes colour from purple to
colourless.
MnO4– → Mn2+
ii)Dichromate in acidic solution changes colour from orange to green.
Cr2O7 2– → Cr3+
Other common oxidizing agents are chlorine, potassium chromate, sodium chlorate
and manganese (IV) oxide.
Similarly, certain reducing agents undergo a visible colour change with a substance
which is easily reduced.
For example,
i)A moist starch solution changes potassium iodide paper to blue-black to show
that iodine is formed, 2I– → I2. That is potassium iodide is a reducing agent.
ii)Hydrogen sulphide bubbled through a solution of an oxidizing agent forms a
yellow precipitate,  S2– → S. That is H2S is a reducing agent.
Other common reducing agents are carbon, carbon monoxide, sodium
thiosulphate, sodium sulphite and iron (II) salts.
The oxidizing or reducing ability of substances depend on many factors. Some
of these are:
•Electronegativity:  Elements with high electronegativity such as F2, O2, N2 and
Cl2 are good oxidizing agents. Elements with low electronegativity for example,
metallic elements like Na, K, Mg and Al are good reducing agents.
•Oxidation states:  In a compound or ion, if one of its elements is in a higher
oxidation state, then it is an oxidizing agent. Similarly, if an element of a compoundor ion is in a lower oxidation state, then it is a reducing agent..
Examples

reduction reaction take place simultaneously in a given reaction.
Activity 4.11

1. Why a reducing agent undergoes oxidation?
2. Why must every redox reaction involve both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent?
Present your discussion to the class.
Example 4
Identify the oxidizing agent, reducing agent, the substance oxidized and reduced
in the following reaction.
H2S + Br2  Æ  2HBr + S
Solution:
Let us assign oxidation number to all the elements of the reactants and products.
In the reaction, the S atom in H2S increases its oxidation number from –2 to
0. Hence, S is oxidized and H2S is a reducing agent. The oxidation number of
Br is decreased from 0 to –1. Thus, Br2 is reduced and is an oxidizing agent.
Example 5
Write the oxidizing and reducing agents for the reaction given below:
Cu + HNO3  Æ  Cu(NO3)2 + NO + H2O

143Non-redox Reactions
So far we have discussed oxidation and reduction reaction or redox reactions.
However, there are also reactions in which oxidation and reduction do not occur andsuch types of reactions are known as non-redox reactions .
In non-redox reactions, no electrons are exchanged between the reacting substances.
Therefore, the oxidation numbers of the atoms do not change in the reaction. Usually suchtypes of reactions involve the exchange of positive and negative ions. Most of the doubledisplacement reactions and acid-base reactions are not oxidation-reduction reactions.

smooth curve through maximum points.
4.Why the graph is steep in the beginning but horizontal at the end of the reaction?
5.At what time does the reaction stop?
Every chemical reaction proceeds at different rates or speed. Some reactions proceed
very slowly and may take a number of days to complete; while others are very rapid,requiring only a few seconds.
The rate of a chemical reaction  measures the decrease in concentration of a reactant
or the increase in concentration of a product per unit time. This means that the rate ofa reaction determines how fast the concentration of a reactant or product changeswith time. The rate of a reaction is obtained by determining the concentration ofreactants or products during the reaction. Methods for determining the concentrationof reactants or products depend on the type of reactions. Some of the methods are:
aColour ( changes in colour )
bPressure ( increase or decrease in pressure, particularly in gases )
cV olume ( increase or decrease in size, particularly in gases )
dMass ( gain or loss in weight )
eAmount of precipitate formed
Generally, the rate of a reaction can be obtained by measuring either one of the above
changes in properties of substances and consequently relating to changes in theirconcentrations during the course of the reaction.
Change in concentration of substanceRateof reaction =Change in time∆=∆C
t
From this expression, it follows that the rate of a reaction is inversely proportional to
the time taken by the reaction.
1Rate α Time
Figure 4.12  illustrates the changes of the rate of a chemical reaction with time. A
reaction becomes slower as reactants are consumed. The reaction rate curve becomesless steep until it becomes a horizontal straight line. No more reactant is used up atthis point.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
147Note that the rate of a reaction is the slope of the tangent to the curve at any
particular time.

acid, hydrogen gas is evolved. When a graph of volume versus time is drawn, show
that the total volume of the gas evolved can be measured at fixed intervals.
Pre-conditions for a Chemical Reaction
Chemical reactions are usually explained by the collision theory. The assumption of the
collision theory is that chemical reactions take place due to the collision betweenmolecules.
1.  Collisions between reactants
The first precondition for a reaction to occur is the direct contact of the reacting
substance with each other. However, all collisions between molecules are notnecessarily effective in bringing a reaction.
2.  Activation energy
If the collisions between the reactant molecules do not have sufficient energy, then no
reaction will occur. Therefore, for the reaction to take place collision must alwaysoccur with sufficient energy to break the bonds in the reactants and form new bondsin the product. Thus, minimum amount of energy needed for the reaction is known asactivation energy .
3.  Proper Orientation
Collision of molecules with sufficient activation energy will not bring a reaction if the
reacting molecules are poorly oriented. Thus, the collision between molecules shouldhave the proper orientation.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
148Activity 4.13
Consider the reaction between H2 and Cl2 molecules:
H2 + Cl2  Æ  2HCl
For the reaction to occur, first H2 and Cl2 molecules must collide with each other. For
the collision to be effective, these colliding molecules ( H2 and Cl2) must have sufficient
energy to break the H – H  and Cl – Cl  bonds and consequently to form new H – Cl
bonds.
Unless, the H2 and Cl2 molecules are oriented in proper positions, there is no product
formed. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4.13(c)  the H2 and Cl2 molecules rearrange
themselves so as to form a new H – Cl  molecule.

Factors Affecting the Rates of Chemical Reaction
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1.   How is the burning of charcoal affected by:
aincreasing the amount of air used
badding more charcoal.
2.   How can you increase the rate of combustion of a given block of wood ?
Present your findings to the class.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
149The rate of a chemical reaction depends on nature of reactants, temperature, and
concentration of reactants, surface area and catalysts.
The collision theory assumes that the rate of a reaction depends on the number
(frequency ) of collisions of particles and those factors which affect the frequency of
collisions will also affect the rate of a reaction. Now let us discuss each factor.
1.  Nature of the reactants
The rate of a reaction is influenced by the type and nature of the reacting substances.
For example, the following reactions have different rates due to the nature of the
reactants, Mg, Fe and Cu.
Mg + 2HCl  Æ  MgCl2 + H2... (very fast reaction )
Fe + 2HCl  Æ  FeCl2 + H2... (slow reaction )
Cu + HCl  Æ  No reaction
2.  Temperature
An increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction. This is because as the
temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases which inturn increases the number of effective collisions.
In general, for many chemical reactions, the rate of a reaction doubles for every 10°C
rise in temperature.
3.  Concentration of reactants
The number of collisions is proportional to the concentration of reactants. The higher
the concentration of the reactants, the more collisions between the reacting particlesand thus the higher the rate of the reaction.
For example, if you heat a piece of steel wool in air (21% oxygen by volume) it burns
slowly. But in pure oxygen (100% oxygen by volume) it bursts in to a dazzling whiteflame. This indicates that the rate of burning increases as the concentration of oxygenis higher.Activity 4.14

151     Experiment 4.114.  Surface area
When the reactants are in different phases, be it solid, liquid or gas, then the surface
area of the substances affect the rate of the reaction. The higher the surface area ofreactants, the faster is the rate of the reaction. This is because more contact results in
more collisions between each small particle of reactants.

A catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction path
with lower activation energy. Lower activation energy for a reaction corresponds tothe higher reaction rate. Figure 4.16  illustrates how the presence of catalysts speeds
up a reaction.

1544.8.2  Chemical Equilibrium
In the previous chapters, we came across chemical reactions in which all the reactants
are completely converted to products. Such types of reactions are known as
irreversible reactions. Irreversible reactions  proceed only in one direction (forward
direction) and expressed by a single arrow ( →).
Examples
2Na + Cl2  Æ  2NaCl
2KClO3  Æ  2KCl + 3O2
However, there are many chemical reactions that do not proceed to completion. The
products at the same time react to give (produce) the reactants. These are called
reversible reactions .
Reversible reactions take place in both the forward and backward directions under
the same conditions. A double arrow ( →←) or (ZZXYZZ ) pointing in opposite
directions is used in such reaction equations.
Example
N2 + 3H2  ZZXYZZ   2NH3
The forward reaction proceeds from left to right and the reaction that goes from right
to left is the reverse reaction.
Does a reaction stop if it attains equilibrium?Chemical equilibrium  is the state of a chemical system in which the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions are equal. At the state of chemical equilibrium, there is
no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products because the system is indynamic equilibrium. Dynamic equilibrium  means the reaction does not stop and both
the forward and the backward reactions continue at equal rates.
At equilibrium , Rate of forward reaction = Rate of reverse reaction
The law of chemical equilibrium can be expressed mathematically using the molar
concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. The concentration of speciesis denoted by enclosing the formula in square bracket [ ].
Thus, for the reversible reaction:
aA+bB  ZZXYZZ   cC + dD
Rate of forward reaction = Kf [A]a [B]bwhere Kf and Kr are rate constants for the
Rate of reverse reaction = Kr [C]c [D]dforward and reverse reactions respectively.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
155Since at equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse
reaction, it follows:

is 1.2 at this temperature, decide whether the system is at equilibrium or not. If
it is not, predict in which direction, the net reaction will proceed.

157Factors that Affect Chemical Equilibrium
Activity 4.18
Form a group and try to explore at least two properties that can be utilize to determine
the state of chemical equilibrium in system.
Present your findings to the class.
A system remains at a state of chemical equilibrium if there is no change in the
external conditions that disturb the equilibrium. But the point of equilibrium could be
affected due to any external factors like temperature, pressure, concentration and so
on. How a system at equilibrium adjusts itself to any of these changes is stated by theFrench chemist Henri Le Chatelier  in 1888.
Le Chatelier states  that if a stress is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system
will respond in such a way to counteract the stress . The stress could be change in
temperature, concentration or pressure.
The factors affecting chemical equilibrium and their effects:
1.   Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature changes on equilibrium depends on whether the reaction is
exothermic or endothermic. An increase in the temperature of a system will favour an
endothermic reaction and a decrease in temperature favors an exothermic reaction.For example, consider the following reaction:
H
2O(g) + CO(g)   ZZXYZZ    H2(g) + CO2(g); ∆H = – 41 kJ
Since the reaction is exothermic,
i)if temperature is increased, the system will shift to the left.
ii)if temperature is decreased, the system will shift to the right and a high yield of
products ( H2 and CO2) is obtained.Activity 4.17

Pressure changes only affect equilibrium reaction involving gaseous reactants and
products. The effect of pressure on liquids and solids is negligible. An increase inpressure (or decrease in volume) on a gaseous system shifts the equilibrium in the
direction of forming smaller number of moles of gas. On the contrary, decreasing the
pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction of forming more number of moles of thegas. For example, in the reaction,
22
3 moles of gases 2 moles of gases2CO(g) + O (g) 2CO (g)    ZZXYZZ

There are 3 moles of reactants and 2 moles of product.
Therefore, increasing the pressure of the system shifts the equilibrium to the forward
direction. This results in a higher yield of CO2. Decreasing the pressure of the gaseous
mixture shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction.
When the number of moles of reactants and products are equal, pressure has no
effect on the equilibrium. For example, in the following reaction;
22
2 molesof gases 2 moles of gasesH( g ) + I( g ) 2HI (g)   ZZXYZZ

the number of moles of reactants and products are equal (2 mol each) and hence no
effect of pressure on the equilibrium.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
1593.  Effect of Concentration
According to Le Chatelier’s  principle, any change in the concentration of a reactant or
product will lead to a change in the concentration of the substances on the other sideof the equation.
If one of the reactants is added to the equilibrium mixture, the system shifts to the
forward direction and a high yield of product is obtained. To the contrary, if moreproduct is added to the system, the equilibrium shifts to the reverse direction. Forexample, in the reaction,
N
2 + 3H2 ZZXYZZ  2NH3
If the concentration of N2 or H2 is increased (i.e., if more N2 or H2 is added), the
equilibrium will shift to the right direction and more NH3 will be produced.
4.  Effect of catalysts
Catalysts change the speed of both the forward and reverse reactions equally.
However, catalysts do not affect the state of chemical equilibrium of a reaction. Thismeans that the position of equilibrium will not be shifted due to the presence of acatalyst.
How can Le-Chatelier’s principle help in maximizing the yields of products
in industrial production?
Many industrial reactions are reversible reactions. The Haber and contact processes
provide excellent illustrations of the effects of temperature, pressure and catalyst on
the equilibrium systems.
A Haber process  (the industrial production of ammonia ). In the Haber
process, ammonia ( NH
3) is industrially manufactured using gaseous nitrogen
and hydrogen.
N2(g) + 3H2 Fe
CatalystZZZXYZZZ 2NH3(g); ∆H = – 92 kJ/mol
High yield of ammonia is produced by decreasing the temperature and
increasing the pressure of the system.
However, the yield per unit time is highly increased by using an iron catalyst.
B Contact process  (the industrial production of sulphuric acid ). Similarly, in
the contact process, sulphuric acid ( H2SO4) is commercially manufactured by
the reaction of SO2 and O2. The resulting SO3 is then converted to H2SO4.

PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
1655.1  INTRODUCTION
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to :
• Name the three physical states of matter.
Discuss each of the following in your group and present your discussion to the class.
1.Name two examples for each of solids, liquids and gases.
2.What happens when you heat an ice cube?
You recall that all object around us is called matter . Matter is defined as anything that
occupies space and has mass. It can exist in the form of gas, liquid and solid. Thesimplest example is the water we use in our daily life. The three physical states of
water are:
• Steam, water in the form of gas.
• Water, in the form of liquid.• Ice, water in the form of solid.
The changes of the states of matter are our every day experience. That is, ice melts
and water freezes; water boils and steam condenses.
The physical state of a given sample of matter depends on the temperature and
pressure. Changing these conditions or variables may change the behaviour of thesubstances as solids, liquids or gases.
Solid
A solid  has a definite shape and a definite volume. Solids are almost completely
incompressible and have very high average density. A high average density reflects thefact that the particles within solids are usually packed closer than those in liquids orgases do. The tightly packed particles of solids are also highly organized.
The particles of a solid, whether they are atoms, ions or molecules only vibrate about
a fixed point with respect to the neighboring particles. Because of these, the particlesmaintain a fixed position; for example substances like metals, wood, coal and stone,are solids.Activity 5.1
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
166Liquid
A liquid  has a definite volume, but does not have a definite shape. Liquids take the
shape of their container. This is explained in terms of arrangement of particles. In the
liquid state, particles vibrate about a point, and constantly shift their positions relativeto their neighbours. At room temperature, water, ethanol, benzene and oil are liquids.
Gas
A gas has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. This is because its particles
are virtually independent of one another. For example, air, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide and nitrogen are gases.
Plasma
Besides, solid, liquid and gas, there exists a fourth-state of matter  at very high
temperature (million degrees Celsius). At such high temperatures molecules cannot
exist. Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons. This state of matter, a
gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is called plasma. Because of theextreme temperatures needed for fusion, no material can exist in the plasma state.

2.In which state do the particles possess the highest kinetic energy?
5.2.1  The Kinetic Theory of Matter
The three states of matter in which substances are chemically the same but physically
different are explained by the kinetic theory of matter. The kinetic theory of matter givesan explanation of the nature of the motion and the heat energy. According to the kinetictheory of matter, every substance consists of a very large number of very small particlescalled ions, atoms and molecules. The particles are in a state of continuous and randommotion with all possible velocities. The motion of the particles increases with a rise intemperature.
Generally, the kinetic theory of matter is based on the following three assumptions:
1.All matter is composed of particles which are in constant motion.
2.The particles possess kinetic energy and potential energy.
3.The difference between the three states of matter is due to their energy contents
and the motion of the particles.
5.2.2  Properties of Matter
Form a group and discuss each of the following idea.Present your discussion to the class.
1.Compare and contrast the density of solid, liquid and gaseous forms of a substance.
2.Discuss the compressibility of solid, liquid and gaseous forms of water.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
168As discussed earlier, matter exists as gas, liquid, and solid. Their properties are
explained in terms of the kinetic theory as follows:
Properties of Gases
From the kinetic molecular theory of gases, the following general properties of gases
can be summarized.
1. Gases have no definite shape and definite volume . This is because gases assume
the volume and shape of their containers.
2. Gases can be easily compressed . By applying pressure to the walls of a flexible
container, gases can be compressed; the compression results in a decrease involume. This happens due to the large spaces between the particles of gases.
3. Gases have low densities compared with liquids and solids . This is due to the
fact that the particles of a gas are very far apart and the number of moleculesper unit volume is very small. A small mass of a gas in a large volume results ina very low density.
4. Gases exert pressure in all directions . Gases that are confined in a container
exert pressure on the walls of their container. This pressure is due to collisionsbetween gas molecules and the walls of the container.
5. Gases easily flow and diffuse through one another .  A gas moves freely and
randomly throughout in a given space.
Properties of Liquids
Liquids can be characterized by the following properties.
1. Liquids have a definite volume, but have no definite shape . They assume the
shapes of their container. Lack of a definite shape for liquid substances arisesfrom its low intermolecular forces as compared to that of solids.
2. Liquids have higher densities than gases . Their density is a result of the close
arrangement of liquid particles. Thus, the particles of liquids are closer thanthose of gases. This accounts for the higher densities of liquids as compared togases.
3. Liquids are slightly compressible . With very little free spaces between their particles
liquids resist an applied external force and thus are compressed very slightly.
4. Liquids are fluids . A fluid is a substance that can easily flow. Most liquids naturally
flow downhill because of gravity. Because liquids flow readily the molecules ofa liquid can mix with each other. They flow much more slowly than gases.
Properties of Solids
1. Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume . This is due to the strong
force of attraction that holds the particles of solids together.
PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
1692. Solids generally have higher densities than gases and liquids . The particles of
solids are very close to each other. There is almost no empty space betweenthe particles of solids. This closeness of particles makes solids to have moreparticles (mass) per unit volume, and hence solids have high density.
3. Solids are extremely difficult to compress . This is because of the high interparticle
forces, and a very short distance between the particles.
4. Solids are not fluids . That is they normally do not flow. This is due to the fact
that solid particles are rigidly held in position by strong forces that cause therestricted motion of their particles.

the class.

5.3.1  The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases
The particles in an ideal gas are very widely spaced and they are in a constant
random motion. The pressure of a gas is the result of continuous collisions between
the particles and the walls of their container.
PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
171Activity 5.6
Assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases
1.The particles are in a state of constant, continuous, rapid, random motion and,
therefore, possess kinetic energy. The motion is constantly interrupted by collisionswith molecules or with the container. The pressure of a gas is the effect of thesemolecular impacts.
2.The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the
gas. Gases are composed of separate, tiny invisible particles called molecules .
Since these molecules are so far apart, the total volume of the molecules isextremely small compared with the total volume of the gas. Therefore, underordinary conditions, the gas consists chiefly of empty space. This assumptionexplains why gases are so easily compressed and why they can mix so readily.
3.The attractive forces between the particles are negligible. There are no forces of
attraction or repulsion between gas particles. You can think of an ideal gasmolecule as behaving like small billiard balls. When they collide, they do notstick together but immediately bounce apart.
4.The average kinetic energy of gas particles depends on the temperature of the
gas. At any particular moment, the molecules in a gas have different velocities.The mathematical formula for kinetic energy is K.E. = ½ mν
2, where m is mass
and ν is velocity of gas molecules. Because the molecules have different velocities,
they have different kinetic energies. However, it is assumed that the averagekinetic energy of the molecules is directly proportional to the absolute ( Kelvin )
temperature of the gas.
5.3.2  The Gas Laws
Form a group and discuss the following phenomena in terms of the gas laws. Present your
conclusion to the class.
aThe increase in pressure in an automobile tire on a hot day.
bThe loud noise heard when a light bulb shatters.
The gas laws are the products of many experiments on the physical properties of
gases, which were carried out over hundreds of years. The observation of Boyle and
other scientists led to the development of the Gas Laws . The gas laws express
mathematical relationships between the volume, temperature, pressure, and quantity of
a gas.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
172Pressure:  pressure is defined as the force applied per unit area.
ForcePressure =
Area
Pressure is one of the measurable properties of gases. Thus, the pressure of a gas can
be expressed in unit of atmosphere, Pascal, torr, millimetre of mercury. The SI unit of
pressure is Pascal (Pa) , and is defined as one Newton per square metre.
1 Pa = 1 N/m2 and
1 atm = 760 mmHg = 76 cmHg = 760 torr = 101325 Pa = 101.325 kPa
Volume: V olume is the space taken up by a body. The SI unit of volume is the cubic
metre  (m3). V olume is also expressed in cubic centimetre (cm3) and cubic decimetre
(dm3). Other common units of volume are millilitre (mL) and litre (L).
1 cm3= (1×10–2 m)3 = 1×10–6 m3
1 dm3= (1×10–1 m)3 = 1×10–3 m3 = 1 L
A litre is equivalent to one cubic decimeter: The relation is given as follows
1 L = 1000 mL = 1000 cm3 = 1 dm3
Temperature:  Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Three
temperature scales are commonly used. These are °F (degree Fahrenheit), °C (degree
Celsius) and K (Kelvin). In all gas calculations, we use the Kelvin scale oftemperature.
We use the following formulae for all necessary inter-conversions:

PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
173Molar Volume and Standard Conditions (STP)
The conditions of a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 0oC (273.14 K)
are called standard temperature and pressure  or STP for gases. At STP the volume of
one mole of any gas is equal to 22.4 litres. This volume is known as molar gas
volume .
Quantity of gas:  The quantity of a gas is expressed in mole ( n). Mole is the quantity
of gas in terms of number of particles. It is the number of atoms or molecules in
1 gram-atom  or 1 gram-molecule  of an element or a compound.

Activity 5.7
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. Present your discussion to the class.
Explain why a helium weather balloon expands as it rises more in the air. (Assume the
temperature remains constant.)
The first quantitative experiments on gases were performed by the Irish chemist,
Robert Boyle (1627-1691) . His experiment helped to analyze the relationship
between the volume and pressure of a fixed amount of a gas at constant temperature.Decreasing the external pressure, causes the gas to expand and to increase in volume.Correspondingly, increasing the external pressure allows the gas to contract and
decrease in volume. This is shown in Figure 5.1 .
Figure 5.1 The relation between pressure and volume.
Boyle  studied the relationship between the pressure of the trapped gas and its volume.
Accordingly, he discovered that at constant temperature doubling the pressure on a
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
174sample of gas reduces its volume by one-half. Tripling the gas pressure reduces its
volume to one-third of the original. Generally, the volume of a gas decreases, as thepressure on the gas increases. This volume-pressure relationship is illustrated in
Table 5.1 .

Figure 5.2 Volume versus pressure graph for a gas at constant temperature and mass.
The general volume-pressure relationship illustrated above is called Boyle's  law.
Boyle's law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional
to the pressure at a constant temperature.  The inverse relationship between
pressure and volume is mathematically given as
1αVP (at constant T and n)
From which follows,
V = k1

where k is a constant at a specific temperature  for a given sample of gas.

From your observation what can you conclude about the effect of temperature
on the volume of a gas?
In 1848, Lord Kelvin realized that a temperature of -273.15oC is considered as
absolute zero. Absolute zero is theoretically the lowest attainable temperature. Then he
set up an absolute temperature scale, or the Kelvin temperature scale , with absolute
zero as the starting point on the Kelvin scale.
The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is closely related to the Kelvin
temperature. The volume of a gas and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional toeach other. For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature causes the volume of a gas
to double, and reducing the Kelvin temperature by half causes the volume of a gas to
decrease by half. This relationship between Kelvin temperature and the volume of agas is known as Charles’ law .
Charles’ law  states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure
varies directly with the Kelvin temperature.
PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
179Mathematically;
V a T at constant P and n:
V = kT,o r   =
T kV
The value of T is the Kelvin temperature, and k is a constant. The value of k depends
only on the quantity of gas and the pressure. The ratio V/T for any set of volume-
temperature values always equals the same k. Charles' law can be applied directly to
volume-temperature problems using the relationship:
12
12VV=TT
where V1 and T1 represent the initial condition; V2 and T2 represent the new
condition.
Charles  found that the volume of a gas at constant pressure increases linearly with
the temperature of the gas. That is, a plot of the volume of a gas versus itstemperature (K) gives a straight line assuming the pressure remains constant.Figure 5.5  illustrates the relationship between the volume of a gas and Kelvin
temperature. If the graph is extrapolated to give zero volume for a gas, thetemperature reached is –273.15
oC. This temperature is the lowest temperature
attained by a gas and it is called absolute zero .

A sample of a gas often undergoes changes in temperature, pressure, and volume.
When this happens, the three variables must be dealt with at the same time.
Boyle’s  law and Charles’  law can be combined to give one expression called the
combined gas law . The combined gas law expresses the relationship between
pressure, volume, and temperature of a fixed amount of gas.
Derivation of the combined gas law:
Boyle’s law:   V a 1/P
Charles’ law:  V a T

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
184Activity 5.12
The relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro’s  law states that equal volumes of different
gases, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same
number of molecules . Thus, according to the law the volume of a gas is proportional
to the number of molecules ( moles ) of the gas at STP.
Mathematically,   V α n; where V is the volume and n is number of moles.
5.  The Ideal Gas Equation
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. Present your discussion to the class.
A balloon can burst when too much air is added into it. Describe what happens to the
pressure, volume, temperature, number of moles, and the balloon itself as it is inflated and
finally bursts. Can you derive an equation which describes these relationships?
An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys the gas laws. Real gases only obey the
ideal gas laws closely at high temperature and low pressure. Under these conditions,their particles are very far apart. The ideal gas law is a combination of Boyle’s law,Charles’ law and Avogadro’s law.
We have considered the three laws that describe the behavior of gases as revealed by
experimental observations:
Boyle's law: V α
1
P (at constant T and n)
Charles' law: V α T (at constant P and n)
Avogadro's law: V α n (at constant P and T)
This relationship indicates how the volume of gas depends on pressure, temperature
and number of moles.

or =nTVRP
where R, is a proportionality constant called the gas constant.

Thus, the ideal gas equation describes the relationship among the four variables P, V,
T and n. An ideal gas is a gas whose pressure-volume-temperature behavior can be
completely explained by the ideal gas equation.At STP, the values of R can be calculated from the ideal gas equation.

Activity 5.13
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. Present your discussion to the class.
Explain why a helium-filled balloon deflated over time faster than an air-filled balloon does.
(Hint:   A balloon has many invisible pinholes).
We have seen that a gas tends to expand and occupy any space available to it. This
spreading of gas molecules is called diffusion .
How do you compare the rate of diffusion of molecules with different
densities?
Thomas Graham (1805 - 1869) , an English chemist, studied the rate of diffusion of
different gases. He found that gases having low densities diffuse faster than gases withhigh densities. He was able to describe quantitatively the relationship between the
density of a gas and its rate of diffusion. In 1829, he announced what is known as
Graham's law of diffusion .
Graham’s law of diffusion  states that at constant temperature and pressure, the rate
of diffusion of a gas , r, is inversely proportional to the square root of its density,
d, or molar mass , M.
Mathematically it can be expressed as:
1 or  1          ∝∝
drrM;
where r is the rate of diffusion, d is the density and M is the molecular mass of the gas.
For two gases (Gas 1 and Gas 2), their rates of diffusion can be given as:

Let rCH4 and rx be the rates of diffusion of CH4 and the unknown gas

Let MCH4 and Mx be the molecular masses of CH4 and the unknown gas

The rate of diffusion of CH4 is two times faster than the unknown gas. This

Discuss the following activities in your group and present to the class.
1.Why some liquids are volatile and others are not?
2.What is the relationship between altitude and boiling point of a liquid?
You recall that liquids have a definite volume and an indefinite shape. They take the
shape of their containers to the level they fill. On the average, liquids are more densethan gases, but less dense than solids.
As in a gas, particles in a liquid are in constant motion. However, the particles in a
liquid are closer together than those in a gas. The attractive forces between particlesin a liquid are more effective than between particles in a gas. This attraction betweenliquid particles is caused by the intermolecular forces ( dipole-dipole forces, London
dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonding ).
Liquids are more ordered than gases because of the stronger intermolecular forces
and the lower mobility of liquid particles. Accordingly, liquid particles are not boundtogether in fixed positions.
Energy Changes in Liquids
The process by which a liquid changes to a gas is known as vaporization . Evaporation
is the process by which liquid molecules break freely from the liquid surface and enterthe vapor phase. Evaporation is explained in terms of the energy possessed by themolecules on the surface of the liquid.
PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
191In an open container, evaporation continues until all of the liquid enters the vapor
phase. However, liquids in a closed container behave differently. The volume of theliquid decreases for a period of time, and remains unchanged. In closed containers,the vapor cannot escape. As the vapor concentration increases, some of the vapormolecules lose energy and return to the liquid state. When a vapor returns to theliquid state, it is said to condense . The process is called condensation . Evaporation
and condensation are opposing processes.
Liquid
Evaporation
CondensationZZZZZZX Z YZZZZZZ Z Gas
The rate of evaporation of a liquid depends on three factors. These are temperature,
intermolecular forces, and surface area of the liquid.
An increase in temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the molecules and
this increases the tendency to change into the gaseous state. Some liquids evaporatereadily at room temperature. Such liquids are said to be volatile . The volatile liquids
have relatively weak forces of attraction between particles. Diethyl ether, ethyl alcohol,benzene and acetone are volatile liquids.
Non-volatile liquids have a little tendency to evaporate at a given temperature. They
have relatively stronger attractive forces between their molecules, e.g., sulphuric acid,water, and molten ionic compounds.
Vapour pressure:  The partial pressure of the vapour above a liquid is called vapour
pressure . The vapour pressure of a liquid depends up on the temperature. At a given
temperature, vapour pressure is constant. As the temperature increases, the vapourpressure of a liquid also increases due to high rate of evaporation.
Vapour pressure depends also on the strength of the intermolecular forces between
the particles of the liquid. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the lower the vapourpressure will be, because fewer particles will have enough kinetic energy to overcomethe attractive force at a given temperature. For example, water and alcohol haverelatively low vapour pressure. On the contrary, liquids with low intermolecular forceshave high vapour pressures at room temperature. For example, diethyl ether, a non-polar molecule with relatively weak dispersion forces, has a relatively higher vapourpressure.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
192Boiling and Boiling Point
What is the difference between evaporation and boiling? How does boiling
point depend on the external pressure?
Boiling  is the change of a liquid to bubbles of vapour that appear throughout the
liquids. It is the conversion of liquid to vapour within the liquid as well as at its
surface. It occurs when the equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals theatmospheric pressure. During evaporation only molecules at the surface escape into
the vapour phase, but at the boiling point the molecules within the liquid have sufficient
energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces of their neighbors, so bubblesof vapour are released at the surface. It is the formation of vapour bubbles within the
liquid itself that characterizes boiling and distinguishes it from evaporation.
If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the equilibrium vapour pressure also
increases. Finally, the boiling point is reached. The boiling point  of a liquid is the
temperature at which the equilibrium vapour pressure of the liquid equals theatmospheric pressure. Therefore, the lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower theboiling point will be.
The boiling point of a liquid can be reduced as lowering the external pressure,
because the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure at a lowertemperature.
If the external pressure is 1.0 atmosphere (760 mmHg), the boiling point is called
normal boiling point . For instance water boils, at 100°C at 1.0 atmospheric pressure.
Thus, the normal boiling point of water is 100°C.

PHYSICAL STATES OF MATTER
195Boiling of a liquid requires a certain amount of heat energy to break the forces of
attraction that holds the molecules together. The amount of heat energy necessary tobring about the vaporization of a fixed amount of a liquid at a fixed temperature to thegaseous state is called the heat of vaporization . For example, the heat of vaporization
per mole of water at 298 K and 1 atmosphere is 44.0 kJ. This is called the molar
heat of vaporization ( ∆H
vap) of water .
Molar heat of vaporization ( ∆Hvap) and molar heat of condensation ( ∆Hcond) are
equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, i.e., ∆Hvap = – ∆Hcond. Vaporization is an
endothermic processes where as condensation is an exothermic process.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
196When a solid is continuously heated its ordered crystalline structure is disturbed. The
particles attain their freedom of motion gradually and melting (or fusion) takes placewhere the solid is converted into the liquid state. The temperature at which acrystalline solid is converted to a liquid is known as the melting point .
In contrast when a liquid is cooled, the molecules become closer and closer, and the
intermolecular forces of attraction become stronger and stronger. The particles arrangethemselves into a regular pattern in the liquid. This process is called freezing  or
solidification. Note that the freezing point of a liquid is the same as the melting point ofa crystalline solid. This means that:
• Both melting and freezing take place at the same temperature.• Both liquid and solid phases coexist at equilibrium with each other at the melting
or freezing point.
To clarify this, let us consider ice, which melts at 0°C and water freezes at 0°C. Ice
and water coexist in equilibrium with each other at 0°C as follows.

The amount of heat needed to convert one gram of a solid to a liquid at the melting
point is called heat of fusion . The molar heat of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion
(∆Hfus) is the quantity of heat needed to convert one mole of a solid at its melting
point to the liquid state. For example, the molar heat of fusion of ice is 6.01 kJ at0°C. This is the amount of energy needed to break the attractive forces in the solid atthe melting point. Melting requires the supply of energy; therefore, it is an endothermicprocess.
During the process of solidification, an amount of heat equal to the heat of fusion must
be liberated. This quantity of heat liberated, which is exactly equal to the heat offusion, is called the heat of solidification or heat of crystallization .
The molar heat of crystallization ( ∆H
cryst) is the quantity of energy that must be
removed from one mole of a liquid to convert it to the solid state at its freezing point.
∆Hcryst = –∆Hfus
Although the motion of the particles in a solid are more restricted than those in a
liquid, many solids have a significant vapour pressure and evaporate directly from thesolid to the vapour state without passing through the liquid state. This process is calledsublimation .

197During the sublimation process heat energy is absorbed. That is, it is an endothermic
process.
Molar heat of sublimation (∆Hfus) is the quantity of heat required to convert one mole
of a solid to a gas at its sublimation point. The heat (enthalpy) of sublimation is related
to the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization by:
DHsub = DHfus + DHvap
Phase Changes and Energy Changes in Solids
A phase is any part of a system that has uniform composition and properties.  A state
of matter represents a phase. Most solid substances undergo two changes of statewhen heated. A solid change to a liquid at the melting point, and the liquid changes tovapour at the boiling point. To understand state changes, we will consider the heatingcurve for a substance given in Figure 5.10 .
A heating curve is a plot of temperature verses the uniform addition of heat. This can
be illustrated for a hypothetical substance, in which the temperature of the substance ison the vertical axis and the passage of time during which heat is added to thesubstance is on the horizontal axis. Figure 5.10  shows the changes in the temperature
and phases of a pure substance as it is heated, beginning with a solid and continuingto the gaseous state as described.
Figure 5.10   Heating curve.
Initially, the substance exists in the solid state, and the addition of heat increases its
temperature. When the solid is heated, its temperature rises (A to B) until it reachesthe melting point (point B), and the temperature remains constant (B to C) until all the
CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
198solid is converted to a liquid (point C). The added heat energy is used to break the
intermolecular forces, thus disrupting the solid structure. At point C phase change iscompleted. Once melting is completed, heating of the liquid raises its temperature(C to D) until the boiling point is reached at point D. In region (D to E) the additionof heat is utilized to break the intermolecular forces of the liquid to change it to a gas.When all the liquid has been converted into a gas, addition of heat simply raises thetemperature of the gas.

Friedrich Wöhler
In 1828 German chemist, Friedrich Wöhler  converted
ammonium cyanate, an inorganic compound, into the organic
substance urea. Wöhler’s  discovery revolutionized the study of
chemistry by redefining the manner in which chemists
distinguished between inorganic and organic compounds. He is
also credited for his work in isolating the elements aluminium
and beryllium.Friedrich WöhlerHistorical Notes
1. Do you agree with the notion that says: “carbon compounds can be synthesized only by
animals and plants”?
2. Draw diagrams to show how carbon atoms can link to one another in different ways to
form a variety of compounds by considering only four carbon atoms.
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.Activity 1.1
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
3History of Organic Chemistry
Before the beginning of the nineteenth century, chemists classified compounds into two
classes; organic and inorganic . Those derived from living things ( plants and animals ) were
classified as organic compounds , while those that came from mineral constituents of the
earth or were found with non-living things are classified as inorganic compounds .
What was the basis of this classification? Early chemists believed that organic compounds
differed from inorganic compounds because living things had a special ‘life force’ withinthem, which was invisible and hard to detect. According to the theory of ‘life force’, theonly source of organic compounds was nature itself ( plants and animals ). It was thought
impossible to synthesize them in the laboratory. This was because man could not add orcreate the ‘life force’ within them.
The belief in the ‘life force’ theory continued until Friedrich Wöhler  synthesized urea for
the first time in 1828. In attempting to prepare ammonium cyanate, NH
4CNO, from the
reaction of silver cyanate, AgCNO, and ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, he accidentally
and surprisingly obtained urea, (NH2)2CO:
AgCNO(aq) + NH4Cl(aq)  Æ  AgCl(s) + NH4CNO(aq)
Urea was the first organic compound synthesized in the laboratory. The synthesis of
urea by Friedrich Wöhler  and subsequent synthesis of other organic compounds marked
the downfall of the ‘life force’ theory.
How do you explain organic compounds at present and define organic chemistry?
The common feature of organic compounds is that they all contain the element carbon. O rganic
compounds are the compounds of carbon found in and derived from plants and animals.They also include those substances synthesized in laboratories except the oxides of carbon,carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, cyanides and cyanates.
Besides carbon, these compounds contain a few other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus. The branch of chemistry that studies carboncompounds is called  organic chemistry . This branch of chemistry was developed, starting
from the theory of ‘life force’ to the era in which synthetic organic compounds are used inour daily lives. The number of inorganic compounds discovered and prepared may be in the
region of  some hundred thousand. At present, millions of organic compounds have been
discovered,  synthesized, and used.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
4The main reason for the presence of millions of carbon compounds is the unique property
of carbon called catenation . Catenation is the ability of atoms of the same element to join
together forming short or long chains and rings. A few other elements like sulphur, siliconand boron show this behaviour, but to a much lesser extent.
Classification of Organic Compounds
CH3CH2CHO and CH3COCH3 have the same chemical formula C3H6O. Write their detailed
structures and observe their difference? Why do these compounds have different
properties? Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
Organic compounds are generally classified based on their functional group .
What are functional groups and what groups of organic compounds are known
on the basis of this classification ?
The functional group  is the part of a molecule or a compound that determines the chemical
properties of that molecule or compound. This group also determines some of the physicalproperties of a compound. Based on the functional groups they possess, the most commonclassification of organic compounds including alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, alcohols,aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. The common functional groups of someorganic compounds are given in Table 1.1 .

Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
What are hydrocarbons and on what basis do we categorize them?
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of the elements carbon and hydrogen
only. Hydrocarbons are subdivided into two groups, based on the type of bonding betweencarbon atoms, as saturated hydrocarbons  and unsaturated hydrocarbons .
Saturated Hydrocarbons  are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen containing only
carbon-carbon single bonds. Methane, ethane, and propane are typical examples of thisgroup. Unsaturated  Hydrocarbons  are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen possessing
one or more multiple bonds ( double or triple bonds ) between carbon atoms. Alkenes,
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons are examples of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
A formula that shows all the bonds and atoms is called a detailed structure .  The shorter
structure is called condensed structure .Activity 1.3
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

1.2.1 Alkanes or Paraffins
Draw a graph using the information in Table 1.2  by plotting the number of carbon atoms
of each compound on one axis, and hydrogen atoms on the other. Predict the formulas of
the saturated hydrocarbons containing 8, 9 and 10 carbon atoms and complete Table 1.2 .
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. They contain chains of carbon atoms linked by single
bonds only. Every carbon atom in the molecule forms four single covalent bonds with otheratoms. Alkanes have the general formula C
nH2n+2, where, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . Using this general
formula, we can write the molecular formula of any alkane containing a specific number ofcarbon atoms. For example, the chemical formulas of alkanes containing one, two and threecarbon atoms are C
1H2×1+2 = CH4, C2H2×2 + 2 = C2H6, and C3H2×3 + 2 = C3H8, respectively.
When we compare the formulas of CH4 and C2H6 or C2H6 and C3H8, they differ by one
carbon and two hydrogen atoms or – CH2 – group called the  methylene group . A group of
compounds in which each member of the group differs from the next member by  a  –CH2,
is called a homologous series . Compounds in the same homologous series can be represented
by the same general formula. The individual members of the group are called homologues .
Alkanes contain carbon-carbon single bonds (— C — C —) as their functional group.Activity 1.4

as the number of carbon atoms increase?
2.Categorize the petroleum related products you encounter everyday as solids, liquids
and gases?  Discuss in your group and present it to the class.
1.2.2  Physical Properties of Alkanes
Do you know which alkanes exist in the liquid, solid or gaseous state at room temperature?
What types of intermolecular forces of attraction exist between the molecules of alkanes?Explain why the boiling points and melting points of alkanes increase with increasingnumber of carbon atoms.
At room temperature, the first four alkanes, methane to butane, are gases; whereas pentane
(C
5H12) to heptadecane (C17H36) are liquids, and the alkanes containing eighteen and
more carbon atoms are solids.
Alkanes are nonpolar organic compounds. Weak intermolecular forces called Van der
Waal’s  forces hold their molecules together. The strength of these forces increases with theActivity 1.5
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
10increasing surface area ( molecular mass ) of the alkanes. Since alkanes are non-polar,
they are almost insoluble in polar solvents like water, but, they are soluble in non-polarsolvents like benzene, toluene, ether and carbon tetrachloride.
The density, melting point, and boiling point of the homologous series of alkanes increase
as the carbon number increases. For alkanes of the same carbon number, branched-chainisomers have lower boiling points than the straight-chain ( normal ) alkanes. The reason is,
as branching increases, there is a decrease in surface area and the strength of theintermolecular force, which, in turn, results in a decrease in boiling point; e.g., the boilingpoints of n-pentane, iso-pentane and neo-pentane are 36°C, 28°C and 9.5°C, respectively.
Alkanes containing all the carbon atoms in one continuous chain are called normal or
straight-chain alkanes  and those containing  chains with branches are known as branched-
chain alkanes .
Example
In alkanes ( branched  or straight-chain ) each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to
four atoms with a bond angle of 109.5°.

In alkanes containing a continuous chain of carbon atoms, the carbon atoms are not linked
in straight line but in zigzag chains to keep the tetrahedral distribution of atoms.

1. Why rules are important for naming organic compounds?    Discuss in your group some
of the rules you know for naming organic compounds and present it to your class.
2. In mathematics, the names pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon are used to
describe polygons. What does each of the prefixes- pent, -hex, -hept and -oct indicate?
What is the significance of these prefixes in chemistry? Discuss in groups and present
it to the class.
1.2.3  Nomenclature (naming) of Alkanes
Organic chemistry uses a simplified and systematic way of naming organic compounds. The
names of alkanes and most of the organic compounds are derived from:
i)a prefix-  indicating the number of carbon atoms (listed in Table 1.3 )and
ii)a -suffix  indicating the type of the functional group present in the molecule.
The following table introduces the prefixes that are used to indicate the presence of one to
ten carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain.
Table 1.3   Prefixes commonly used to indicate one to ten carbon atoms.
Prefix Number of carbon atoms Prefix Number of carbon atoms
Meth- One Hex- Six
Eth- Two Hept- Seven
Prop- Three Oct- Eight
But- Four Non- Nine
Pent- Five Dec- T en
From Table 1.2 , you can note that the names of all alkanes contain the suffix ‘ -ane’, which
indicates that their functional group is a carbon — carbon single bond. Thus, to name anActivity 1.6
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
12alkane, you should use the appropriate prefix that indicates the number of carbon atoms and
the suffix ‘ -ane’. For example, to name the alkane C6H14, use the prefix ‘ Hex’ that indicate
the presence of six carbon atoms and add the suffix ‘ -ane’ so that the name becomes hexane .
Practice naming alkanes using first four prefixes mentioned in Table 1.3. In naming alkanes,
why are number of carbon atoms used as prefixes? Discuss in groups.
Common Names of Alkanes
Lower members of the alkane homologous series have common names. The prefixes used
in the common names are n- (normal ), ‘iso-’ and ‘neo-’. The prefix n- is used when all the
carbon atoms form a continuous chain.
Example
Iso- is used when all of the carbon atoms form a continuous chain, except for the one
next to the last carbon.
Example
Neo-  is used when the central carbon is bonded to four other carbon atoms.
ExampleActivity 1.7
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
13IUPAC System of Nomenclature of Alkanes
It is difficult to have common names for the more branched and complex alkanes. In
naming such alkanes, the more systematic, convenient and appropriate one is theInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system.  In order to applythis system, it is very important to know the rules to be followed, what alkyl radicals are,and how they are named.
Alkyl radicals  are obtained by removing one hydrogen atom from the corresponding
alkanes. Their general formula is C
nH2n+1, where n = 1, 2, 3 . . . . The names of alkyl
radicals are derived from the names of the corresponding parent alkanes by changing thesuffix -ane  to -yl.

The system of naming organic compounds is based on the recommendations of IUPAC.
The following are the rules established by IUPAC to name branched-chain hydrocarbons.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
141.Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule as the parent
structure . The name of the straight-chain alkane possessing the same number of
carbon atoms is used as the name of this longest chain. The groups attached to theparent structure are called side chains  or substituents .
Example 1
There are seven carbon atoms in the longest chain ( the parent structure ). Therefore, it
gets the name “heptane”.
2.Assign numbers to the carbon atoms of the longest chain starting from one end to
the other so that the carbon atoms to which side chains are attached get the lowestpossible number.
To check which direction of numbering is correct; add the locants ( numbers assigned
to the carbon atoms to which substituents are attached ).
The sum of locants in the first case is 3 + 4 = 7 and in the second case, 4 + 5 = 9.
So numbering should be done from left to right in this case. Thus, the first option iscorrect.
3.Indicate the position of the side chain by using the number assigned to the carbon
atom to which it is attached. If the same substituents appear more than once, use the
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
15prefix di-, tri-, tetra-  etc. before the name of the substituent to show two, three ,
four, etc. substituents, respectively.
4.Numbers are separated from each other by commas while they are separated from
substituent names by hyphens.
5.Arrange the names of the side chains before the parent name in alphabetical order.
The complete name of the alkane given in the above example will then be 4-ethyl-3-methylheptane (substituents in alphabetical order ).
Example 2
H C—C—C H—C—C H331 23 4CH3
CH3 H C—C H2356Cl CH3
The longest chain has six carbon atoms and the parent name is hexane. There are two
methyl groups at carbon-2 and another two methyl groups on carbon-4 and one chlorineatom at carbon-3.  Therefore, the correct name of the compound is 3-chloro-2,2,4,4-tetramethylhexane.
Example 3
The longest chain contains eight carbon atoms. Hence, the parent name of the given moleculeis octane. There are three methyl groups attached to carbon number 3, 4 and 6; onebromine atom is attached  to carbon-4 and two chlorine atoms are attached to carbon-3and carbon-5. Thus, the correct name of the compound is 4-bromo-3,5-dichloro-3,4,6-trimethyloctane.

When F, Cl, Br and I appear as substituents, change the names fluorine, chlorine, bromine

There are seven carbon atoms in the parent structure, so it takes the name heptane. There
are two methyl groups at carbon-2 and two methyl groups at carbon-4 and carbon-5 andone fluorine at carbon-3. So the name of the compound is 3-fluoro-2,2,4,5-tetramethylheptane.

There is only one possible structure for each of the first three alkanes, namely, methane
(CH4), ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8). Those alkanes containing four or more carbon
atoms have more than one structure. The existence of two or more chemical compounds
with the same molecular formula but different structures is called isomerism .
The compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures are
called isomers . Alkanes exhibit a type of structural isomerism called chain or skeletal
isomerism . These structures differ in the arrangement of the carbon atoms and hydrogen
atoms. To understand what isomers are, consider the isomers of butane (C4H10) and
pentane (C5H12).

231.2.6  Chemical Properties of Alkanes
Discuss the following points in groups and present your opinions to the class.
1.Which chemical property of alkanes is responsible for generating electricity in diesel
power stations or for moving motor vehicles? Name the major product formed when
the fuel has been consumed in the diesel power station.
2.The reaction of methane with oxygen produces two different oxides of carbon, CO2
and CO.
1What condition determines whether the product of the methane reaction is CO2 or CO?
bIf a domestic heating system is fuelled by methane, what difference does it make
if the combustion produces CO2 or CO?
Alkanes are generally not considered to be very reactive organic compounds. The name
paraffin for alkanes arose from two Latin words ‘ parum ’ meaning little and ‘ affinis ’ means
affinity . Thus, paraffin means little affinity. This name was suggested because alkanes are
inert towards many reagents like acids, bases, oxidizing and reducing agents. However,they undergo several reactions under suitable conditions.
The major reactions of alkanes are the following:
1. Combustion Reactions:   If alkanes are burned with limited supply of oxygen,
they will form water and carbon monoxide and will liberate lesser amounts of heatenergy. Alkanes burn in excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, liberatinga greater amounts of heat. The general equation for the reaction is:
C
nH2n+2    +    3+ 1
2nÊˆ
Ë¯O2    Æ    nCO2    +    ( n + 1) H2O    +    heat
where n is the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule.
Example
C3H8    +    5O2    Æ    3CO2    +    4H2O    +    2299 kJ
The heat energy liberated is used to generate electricity, to move motor vehicles or
to cook our food.Activity 1.11
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
241.Write the general equation for the combustion of alkanes in a limited supply of oxygen
that forms carbon monoxide, water and energy.
2.Why is a petroleum refinery is built in the open air? Present your opinion to the class.
2. Substitution Reaction:   This is a reaction that involves the replacement of one
atom or a group of atoms by another atom or group of atoms. Halogenation ofalkanes is a very good example of substitution reaction. This reaction involvesreacting alkanes with chlorine and bromine. The reaction of chlorine and brominewith alkanes proceeds in presence of heat or sunlight. This type of reaction iscalled photochemical reaction . The reaction of alkanes with chlorine and bromine
proceeds in a sequence of steps. For example, let us consider the photochemicalreaction of methane with chlorine ( chlorination ):
i) Chain Initiating Step:  This step involves absorption of energy to generate
reactive particles known as free radicals . A free radical is an atom or a
group of atoms possessing unpaired electron. A free radical is electrically neutral.A chlorine molecule absorbs light and decomposes into two chlorine atoms:
ii) Chain Propagating Step:  This is a step which consumes a reactive particle ( free
radical ) produced in the chain initiation step and generates another free radical.
iii) Chain Terminating Step:  In the chain terminating step reactive particles ( free
radicals ) are consumed but not generated.
In this step, ‘side reactions’ that do not lead to the formation of the desired products
often take place.
Examples
Such a detailed step by step description of a chemical reaction is called a  reaction
mechanism .Activity 1.12

The chlorination of methane is an example of a chain reaction that involves a series of
steps.
Alkanes do not react with chlorine and bromine in the dark but they do so in the
presence of sunlight. Discuss the role of sunlight for the reaction in your group and
present to the class.
3. Elimination reaction:  This type of reaction involves the removal of smaller molecules
from a compound and leads to the formation of a compound containing a multiplebond (unsaturated compound). It can also involve the removal of hydrogen atomsfrom adjacent carbon atoms at relatively high temperatures.
Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes are saturated hydrocarbons in which the carbon atoms are linked in such a
manner as to form closed chains or ring structures. They are represented by the general
formula, CnH2n, where n ≥ 3. Cycloalkanes are isomeric with open-chain alkenes. Their
names are obtained by prefixing “cyclo” to the name of an alkane containing the same
number of carbon atoms. The following structures represent some examples of cycloalkanes.Activity 1.13

1.Why some alkenes exist in gaseous and liquid states at room temperature?
2.The melting points, boiling points and densities of alkenes increase with increasing
number of carbon atoms; why?
3.Are alkenes coloured compounds? Do they have smell?
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
At room temperature, alkenes containing two to four carbon atoms are gases. Those
containing five to seventeen carbon atoms are liquids, and those containing eighteen ormore carbon atoms are solids.
Alkenes are non-polar. Therefore, their molecules are held together by weak inter-molecular
forces. Since they are non-polar, they are almost insoluble in polar solvents like water, butsoluble in non-polar solvents like ether, benzene, toluene and carbon tetrachloride.
Nomenclature of Alkenes
Alkenes can have common names as well as IUPAC names. The common names of alkenesare obtained by using the prefixes in Table 1.3 and adding the suffix ‘-ylene’:

eWhich name do you think is more appropriate for the longest chain of carbon
atoms in structure ii? 5-hexene or 1-hexene or hexane?  Discuss these questions in
your group and present to the class.
The IUPAC names of alkenes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3 to
indicate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and adding the suffix ‘ -ene’. The
suffix ‘-ene’ indicates the presence of a double bond. For example, the alkene having theformula C
8H16 is named as octene. The prefix oct- indicates that there are eight carbon
atoms in the molecule and ‘ -ene’ signifies the presence of a double bond.
In the IUPAC system of naming alkenes, the rules we follow are similar to those rules we
follow for naming alkanes with slight modifications. These are:
1.Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule that includes the
double bond as a parent structure. Its name will be the same as the alkene containingthe same number of carbon atoms.     ii )     i )
Why should the double bond(s) in alkenes be included in the longest continuous chain?
Express your opinion to the class.Activity 1.17
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
322.Number the carbon atoms starting from one end to the other in such a way that the
carbon atom preceding the double bond takes the lowest possible number andindicate the position of the double bond by this number in the name.
Example 1
Example 2
The longest chain contains 7 carbon atoms and a double bond between the 2ndand 3rd carbon atoms. Therefore, it takes the name 2-heptene or hept-2-ene.There are three methyl groups at carbon number 3, 4 and 5. So the complete nameof the compound is:
3, 4, 5-trimethyl-2-heptene or 3, 4, 5-trimethyl hept-2-ene
Example 3
The parent structure contains 8 carbon atoms and a double bond between 3rd and
4th carbon atoms. Thus, it is named as 3-octene or oct-3-ene. The side chainsattached are chlorine at the 6th, two methyl groups at 5th and 6th and an ethylgroup at carbon number 3. Therefore, the complete name of the compound is:
6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyl-3-octene,  or
6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyloct-3-ene.

Isomerism in Alkenes
Alkenes containing two and three carbon atoms have only one possible structure.  Alkenes
containing four or more carbon atoms exhibit isomerism. Alkenes show the following threetypes of isomerism:
1. Chain isomerism:  This is due to the difference in the arrangement of the carbon
atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain.
2. Position isomerism:  This is due to the difference in the position of the double bond
in the carbon chain.
Example

position isomers of methylbutene, (a), (c) and (e) are the chain isomers, while all
these compounds are the isomers of C5H12.
3. Geometrical isomerism.  This results from the difference in the relative spatial
arrangement of atoms or groups about the double bond. This isomerism exists becausefree rotation about the double bond is not possible. To differentiate geometricalisomers, we use the prefix ‘ cis’ if two similar groups are on the same side of the
double bond and ‘ trans ’ when the two similar groups are on opposite sides of it;
‘cis’ means the same and ‘ trans ’ means across.
The geometrical isomers of 2-pentene are:
Alkenes have more isomers than the corresponding alkanes.

Chemical properties of Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing double bond (a strong bond and a weak
bond) between the two carbon atoms. They are more reactive than alkanes, because theweak bond can be used for further reaction. They undergo several types of reactions.
1.Combustion reaction.  Alkenes burn in oxygen with a luminous flame to form carbon
dioxide and water.
General reaction:      C

2.Addition reaction.  Alkenes undergo mainly addition reactions. The addition occurs
at the carbon-carbon double bond.
aAddition of halogens (halogenation):  When a halogen molecule, X2, (where,
X2 = Cl2 or Br2) is added to alkenes, the product is a dihaloalkane.
General reaction:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
38Example
If bromine water (bromine in CCl4) is added to alkenes, the reddish brown
colour of Br2 in CCl4 will disappear. This is due to the addition of bromine
(Br2) across the double bond. So, Br2 in CCl4 is used to detect unsaturation
(presence of multiple bond) in a compound.
bAddition of hydrogen (Hydrogenation):  Addition of hydrogen molecule to
alkenes in the presence of a nickel or platinum catalyst yields alkanes.
General reaction:  Pt

Example
cAddition of hydrogen halides, HX (hydrohalogenation):  Addition of hydrogen
halide (HCl, HBr or HI) to alkenes leads to the formation of alkyl halides. Theproduct of the reaction can be predicted by Markovnikov’s rule ; which states
that “when an alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide to give an alkyl halide, thehydrogen adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that has the greater numberof hydrogen atoms, and the halogen to the carbon that has the fewer number ofhydrogen atoms”.
The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form

Uses of Ethene (Ethylene)
Ethene is used in the production of ethanol, and polymers such as polyethene,polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene and teflon. It is also used in the productionof 1,2-ethanediol, which is used as an antifreeze material; and for the preservationas well as artificial ripening of fruits.
Take some green tomatoes in first basket and put a ripe banana in between them. In a
second basket put only green tomatoes (but not a banana). Compare the tomatoes in the
two baskets. Do the tomatoes ripen at the same rate in both baskets; if not, why? Share
your opinion with your classmates.
Cycloalkenes
Cycloalkenes are unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons. The carbon atoms are linked in such a
manner as to form a closed chain or a ring structure. They contain a double bond betweencarbon atoms and are represented by the general formula C
nH2n–2, where n should be
equal to or greater than 3. They are isomeric with alkynes. They are named by prefixing“cyclo” to the name of alkenes containing the same number of carbon atoms. The givenstructures show some examples of cycloalkenes.
The IUPAC names for alkynes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3 . The
suffix ‘-yne’  is added to the prefixes, which indicates the presence of a triple bond between a
pair of adjacent carbon atoms. Alkynes are named in the same way as alkenes.Activity 1.19

46Chemical Properties of Alkynes
Alkynes are more reactive than alkanes and alkenes. Why?
Alkynes are more unsaturated than alkanes and alkenes due to the presence of a carbon-
carbon triple bond. They can undergo combustion and addition reactions.
Some of the common reactions of alkynes are:
1. Combustion reaction:   Alkynes burn with a smoky luminous flame, forming CO2 and
water. Smoky luminous flames result from the combustion of alkynes due to their high
carbon content.

Acetylene is a colourless, sweet-smelling gas in pure form and is insoluble in water. It isusually stored as a solution of acetone in steel cylinders. Combustion of acetylene withoxygen produces an intensely hot flame of about 3000
oC. Thus, a large quantity of acetylene
is used as a fuel in oxy-acetylene torches for cutting and welding metals. Acetylene is alsoused to prepare acrylonitrile which is a starting material for producing polyacrylonitrile, araw material for textile fibre. It is also used for making vinyl chloride which polymerizes toActivity 1.23

1.4  AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
Competencies
At the end of this section you will be able to:
• define the term aromatic hydrocarbons;
• draw the structure of benzene;• describe the main physical properties of benzene;• explain the chemical reactions of benzene;• carry out test-tube reactions with Br
2 in CCl4, KMnO4, concentrated H2SO4.
Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1.What comes to your mind when you hear the word “benzene”?
2.What is the word “aroma” mean?  Which substances have an aroma smell?
3.Are aromatic hydrocarbons unsaturated as alkenes? Why?
The term aromatic is derived from the word ‘aroma’ meaning pleasant smell, which was
originally used to describe naturally occurring compounds with pleasant smells. At present,the term is used without its original significance. Aromatic hydrocarbons are generallyobtained from petroleum and coal tar. They are a group of hydrocarbons characterized bythe presence of a benzene ring or related structures. Some examples of aromatichydrocarbon structures are given below:Activity 1.24
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
51Figure 1.9   Structures of some Aromatic Hydrocarbons.
1.4.1  Benzene
Benzene is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon.  Its molecular formula is C6H6. Friedrich A.
Kekule , in 1865, suggested that the six carbon atoms of benzene are arranged in the shape
of a hexagon. He also suggested a resonance hybrid structure. He represented benzene bythe resonance structures ( Figure 1.10 ) in which the two structures shown make equal
contribution for the resonance hybrid or actual structure.
Figure 1.10   Resonance structures of benzene.
The bonds in benzene are neither single nor double but have an intermediate characterbetween those of single and double bonds. All the carbon-carbon bonds in the moleculeare same in length and nature. Since structure I or II given above are not the true structuresof the benzene molecule, the benzene ring is written, in most cases, in its resonance hybridform as follows:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
52The six electrons in the hexagonal ring are delocalized.
From structures I and II in Figure 1.10 , one may think that benzene has three double
bonds and has the same chemistry as that of alkenes. But, this is not true. Benzene and
other aromatic hydrocarbons are not as unsaturated as alkenes because the three doublebonds in benzene are delocalized due to resonance. They are more stable than alkenes.They undergo substitution reactions to a far greater extent than addition reactions, which is
a different characteristic compared to alkenes.
Physical Properties of Benzene
Benzene is a flammable, colourless, and volatile liquid with a characteristic smell. It is
nonpolar and immiscible with water but miscible with non-polar solvents like ether and
carbon tetrachloride. It freezes at 5.4oC and boils at 80.4oC. It is a carcinogenic ( cancer
causing ) substance. Benzene is a good solvent for fats, gums, rubber etc., and is used in
the manufacture of dyes, drugs and explosives.
Chemical Properties of Benzene
Benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons are more stable than alkenes and alkynes due to
the stability of the aromatic ring. It neither decolorizes bromine water (Br2 in CCl4) nor is
reactive towards cold potassium permanganate solution. However, benzene undergoesthe following reactions:
1. Combustion reaction:  Benzene is highly inflammable. It burns with a smoky luminous
flame to form CO
2 and H2O.
2C6H6 +    15O2   Æ   12CO2     +     6H2O   +    Heat
2. Substitution reaction:  The reactions of benzene are chiefly substitution but not
addition reactions. In this reaction, hydrogen atom from the benzene ring is replacedby another atom or group.
aHalogenation:  Benzene reacts with bromine and chlorine in the presence of
iron (III) chloride or aluminium chloride catalyst to form substitution products.
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
53bNitration:  Concentrated nitric acid mixed with some concentrated sulphuric
acid reacts with benzene at moderate temperatures to form nitrobenzene.
cSulphonation:  Benzene reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid, H2SO4, at room
temperature to form benzenesulphonic acid.
3. Addition reaction:  Benzene undergoes addition reactions under special conditions.
Example
When a mixture of benzene vapour and hydrogen is passed over finely divided nickel
catalyst at 200°C, cyclohexane is formed.

1.5  NATURAL SOURCES OF HYDROCARBONS
Competencies
After completing this subunit, you will be able to:
• list the major natural sources of hydrocarbons;
• describe natural gas;• define crude oil;• explain the fractional distillation of crude oil;• mention the products of the fractional distillation of crude oil;• tell the uses of petroleum products;• describe the composition of coal;• explain the destructive distillation of coal.
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
55Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1.What do you think is the major component of natural gas?
2.How can petroleum be separated into different fractions?
3.How are natural gas, petroleum and coal formed in nature? Can they be recycled?
A.  Natural Gas
The principal sources of hydrocarbons are natural gas, crude oil and coal. Natural gas is
found in association with petroleum or alone. It is found in underground deposits severalhundreds or thousands of metres below the earth’s surface, where it originated from the decay
and decomposition of animal and plant remains millions of years ago. Natural gas mainly
contains methane (more than 90%), ethane, propane, butane and small quantities of higheralkanes. Other gases such as, CO
2, N2, O2 and H2S, may also be present in natural gas.
The composition of natural gas varies, depending on its place of origin. Natural gas iswidely used as a fuel. It is advantageous over liquid and solid fuels and also other gases,except H
2, due to its very high heat of combustion.
B.  Petroleum
The word petroleum is derived from two Latin words, ‘ petra ’ meaning rock, and ‘ oleum ’
meaning oil. Thus, petroleum means rock oil.  The term petroleum refers to a broad range
of fossil hydrocarbons that are found as gases, liquids or solids beneath the surface of theearth.  The crude oil is generally found along with  natural gas in the form of a dark-coloured viscous liquid, which is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Its compositionvaries according to its place of origin. However, crude oil mainly contains alkanes,cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It also contains organic compounds consistingof nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen in small amounts.
Refining of Crude Oil
Crude oil or petroleum is obtained by drilling wells until the oil-bearing region is reached.After the crude oil is brought to the surface of the earth, it must be refined before itcan be used.
Crude oil is refined or separated into several components by fractional distillation based
on the differences in boiling ranges of its fractions. ( Figure 1.11 ).Activity 1.25

Most hydrocarbons present in petroleum are long-chain hydrocarbons. However, there is
a very high demand for petrol or gasoline, which contains hydrocarbons, composed of fiveto ten carbon atoms. Therefore, the amount of petrol obtained by fractional distillation ofcrude oil does not satisfy the demand for it. To satisfy the demand and maximize the outputof petrol or gasoline, the process called cracking is carried out during fractional distillation.
What does cracking mean? Cracking is the decomposition of large hydrocarbon molecules
into smaller ones by the application of heat ( thermal cracking or pyrolysis ) or in the
presence of catalysts ( catalytic cracking ).
Example
16 34 8 18 8 16heatC H  C H     +    C H
Hexadecane Octane Octene→
Hydrogen gas can be added during cracking to saturate the alkenes formed in the process.
C.  Coal
Coal is formed naturally by the decomposition of plant matter over several millions of
years. It is not a pure form of carbon. It is an important source of aromatic hydrocarbons.Heating mineral coal in the absence of air, or oxygen is called destructive distillation of coal
or coking of coal . When coal is heated in the absence of air it gives volatile products and
coke. The volatile products  separate into coal gas and a liquid,  called coal tar when cooled.
Aromatic hydrocarbons and many other substances are isolated from coal tar by fractionaldistillation.
Coke , which is a solid and relatively pure form of carbon, is used as a fuel in the blast
furnace during the extraction of iron. It is also used to produce gaseous fuels, such aswater gas (mixture of H
2 and CO) and producer gas (mixture of  N2 and CO).¸

However, thereare many types of alcohol.  The only alcohol present in all alcoholic beverages is calledethanol .  Other alcohols are used for different purposes.
Alcohols are hydroxyl derivatives of hydrocarbons that can be obtained by replacing one
or more hydrogen atom(s) of a hydrocarbon with the hydroxyl (–OH) group. The hydroxylgroup is the functional group of alcohols.
ExamplesActivity 1.26
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
601.6.1  Classification of Alcohols
Alcohols are generally classified as monohydric , dihydric and trihydric depending on the
number of hydroxyl (–OH) groups they contain in their molecular structure.
Monohydric alcohols  are alcohols containing only one hydroxyl group.
Examples
Dihydric alcohols are those containing two hydroxyl groups per molecule. They are also
named glycols  or diols .
Example
Trihydric alcohols  are those containing three hydroxyl groups in their molecular structure.
Polyhydric alcohols  are those containing three or more hydroxyl groups in their molecular
structure. Trihydric alcohols are also considered as polyhydric alcohols.
Example
1.6.2  Nomenclature of Alcohols
An alcohol can be considered to be derived from a hydrocarbon by the replacement of atleast one H atom by hydroxyl group.  Hence, alcohols can be systematically named byusing the suffix -ol to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane name.

Based on the structural formulas given in table 1.10, derive the general formula for the
homologous series of monohydric alcohols. Discuss in your group and present to the class.
In the IUPAC system of nomenclature of alcohols containing side chains or –OH groups in
different positions, the longest chain to which the –OH group is attached, is chosen as aparent structure. The chain is then numbered, starting from the end closer to the carbonatom to which the –OH group is bonded. The other rules are similar to the nomenclature ofhydrocarbons.
Examples
Classification of Monohydric Alcohols
Carbon atoms can be classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary (3°) and quaternary
(4°) if they are bonded to one, two, three and four carbon atoms, respectively.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
62Example
Carbon atoms indicated by letters a, d, and e, are primary. The carbon atom indicated
by letter b is secondary, and the one indicated by letter c is tertiary.
Monohydric alcohols can be classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) and tertiary (3°)
alcohols, depending on the number of hydrocarbon groups ( alkyl groups ) attached to the
carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is bonded.
Primary alcohols  are those alcohols which have the hydroxyl group connected to a primary
carbon. They can also be defined as a molecule containing a “–CH2OH” group.

2.Why boiling points of dihydric and trihydric alcohols are higher than  those of
monohydric alcohols of comparable molecular size?
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
643.Lower alcohols, like methanol and ethanol, are miscible with water in all proportions,
while lower hydrocarbons are not so. Explain.
4.Based on the boiling point of water, H2O, and methanol, CH3OH, in which one would
you expect to observe a greater degree of hydrogen bonding? Explain. Discuss with
your group and present to the class.
The hydroxyl group in an alcohol is polar due to the high electronegativity of oxygen. As a
result, there is significant hydrogen bonding in alcohols.
Figure 1.12   Hydrogen bonding between molecules of an alcohol.
Due to the hydrogen bonding in alcohols, they have higher melting and boiling points thanhydrocarbons of comparable molecular size ( mass ). Hydrogen bonding is also the cause
for even lower members to be liquids at room temperature. The boiling point of morebranched isomer is lower than that of its isomeric straight-chain alcohol.

3CH2CH2CH2OH, boils at 117.7°C, while
boils at 82.5°C. D ihydric and the trihydric alcohols have higher boiling points than
monohydric alcohols of similar molecular size ( mass). Ethane-1,2-diol ( dihydric alcohol,
molecular mass = 62), boils at 197°C, while 1-propanol ( monohydric, molecular
mass = 60 ) boils at 97.2°C.
The first three alcohols, methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol are miscible with water in all
proportions, while the solubility in water decreases with increasing carbon number. Thewater solubilities of dihydric and trihydric alcohols are higher than those of monohydricalcohols of similar molecular mass.

1 How do the local people in Ethiopia prepare al coholic beverages like “Tella” , “Tej” and
“Katikalla”? What raw materials and apparatus do they use?
2 Which industrial method of production of ethanol is more or less similar to the method
followed by the local people?  Share your ideas with your class.
Ethanol is the second member of the homologous series of monohydric alcohols. It is one
of the constituents of all alcoholic beverages. ‘Tella’, ‘Tej’, beer, wine, ‘Katikalla’, ouzo,
gin and whisky contain ethanol. There are a number of methods for  preparing ethanol
using different materials.
Industrial preparation of Ethanol
Ethanol is manufactured industrially by:
1. Fermentation of carbohydrates such as sugar:  Fermentation is the slow
decomposition of carbohydrates such as sucrose, starch and cellulose in the presence
of suitable enzyme, that  results in the formation of  ethanol and carbon dioxide:
Fermentation can produce an alcoholic beverage whose ethanol content is
12 – 15% only.  The alcohol kills the yeast and inhibits its activity when the percentage
is higher. To produce beverages of higher ethanol content, distillation of the aqueoussolution is required.
Most liquor factories in Ethiopia use molasses, a by-product of sugar industries, as
a raw material to produce ethanol. In the brewing industry, germinated barley calledmalt (in Amharic, ‘Bikil’ ) is used as the starting material. The whole process taking
place in breweries is summarized as follows:
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
67      Experiment 1.62. Catalytic Hydration of Ethene:  Most ethanol is manufactured at present by this
method. In this process, ethene is treated with steam at 573 K and 60 atm pressuresin the presence of phosphoric acid, H
3PO4, catalyst.
Preparation of Ethanol by Fermentation

69Properties and Uses of Ethanol
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with a pleasant smell and a burning taste. It boils at 78.3°C and
freezes at –1 17°C. It is inflammable and burns with a blue flame. It is miscible with water in all
proportions, non-poisonous and has an intoxicating effect. It is a hypnotic ( sleep producer ).
Ethanol is a constituent of all alcoholic beverages. It is a good solvent for many organic
compounds that are insoluble in water, such as paints, dyes, perfumes etc. It is also used asa fuel for cars and spirit lamps, and to make denatured alcohol which is a mixture ofethanol and other poisonous substance that has been added to make the alcohol unfit fordrinking. For example, methylated spirit is a mixture of 95% ethanol and 5% methanol.
• Currently, Ethiopia uses 5% ethanol with 95% benzene as fuel for cars.
1.6.5  Chemical Properties of Alcohols
Activity 1.30
Why alcoholic beverages such as “Tela” , “Tej” , beer and wine turn sour if they are not
properly stored? Which reaction of alcohols is responsible for this phenomenon? Write a
chemical equation to support your answer.  Discuss with your group and present it to the
class.
What types of reactions do alcohols undergo? Alcohols contain a hydrocarbon group and
a functional group (–OH). Which part of alcohols is responsible for most of their chemicalreactions?
Reactions of alcohols may involve the cleavage of the oxygen hydrogen bond (— O — H) or
the carbon-oxygen bond (— C — O).
The reactions of alcohols involving the –O–H bond cleavage are:
aAlcohols react with strongly electropositive metals like Na, K and Ca to form
alkoxides and liberating H
2 gas.
General reaction:
Example
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
70Reactions of Alcohols with Active Metals
Objective: To observe the reaction of alcohols with sodium and magnesium.
Materials required:  Ethanol, sodium and magnesium metal. Test tubes, test tube holder,
test tube rack, measuring cylinder, Bunsen burner, scissors or knife.
Procedure:
Take two test tubes and add 2-5 mL of ethanol to each of the test tubes. Cut a very
small piece of sodium with a knife and drop it into the first test tube. Take magnesiumribbon and drop it in the second test tube.
Observations and analysis:
1.What do you observe:
ain the 1st test tube? bin the 2nd test tube?
2.Is there an evolution of gas? What do you think this gas is?
3.If no reaction occurs in any of the test tubes, heat the mixture gently using a Bunsen
burner and write your observation.
4.Which bond of the alcohol is broken in the reaction?
5.Write a general reaction for such reactions?
6.What type of metals react in this manner?
bOxidation of alcohols:  The oxidation products of alcohols depend on the type of
alcohol and the nature of oxidizing agents. Oxidation of alcohols is a very importantmethod for the production of other oxygen-containing compounds of hydrocarbons,such as aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.
i)Oxidation of primary alcohols in the presence of mild oxidizing agents yields
aldehydes.
General reaction:
Example      Experiment 1.7
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
71Strong oxidizing agents, such as acidified KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 and CrO3 in
H2SO4, oxidize primary alcohol first to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids.
It is difficult to stop the reaction at the aldehyde stage.
Example
Note that aldehydes are represented by the general structural formula  or
RCHO, where R is an alkyl group. In the case of methanal R = H.  For naming aldehydes,use the suffix -al to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding
alkane name.   The suffix “-al” indicates the functional group –CHO. The namesand condensed structures of the first six aldehydes are given in Table 1.11 .

ii)Oxidation of secondary alcohols yields ketones.
General reaction:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
72Example
The general structural formula of ketones is:  or RCOR’ where R
and R’ may be same or different.   The IUPAC names of ketones are obtained
by using the suffix -one to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane
name.  The suffix ‘ -one’ indicates the functional group. Unlike aldehydes, the
position of the functional group must be indicated in the name of higher ketones.To do so, the longest chain containing the functional group is chosen as a parent
structure and then the carbon atoms of the chain are numbered starting from the
end closer to the carbonyl group.
Examples
iii)Tertiary alcohols and ketones are generally resistant to oxidation. However,
they can undergo oxidation under drastic conditions to form a mixture ofcarboxylic acids.

INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
79Industrial application
Organic chemicals are used for the manufacturing of a large number of industrial products
that have a variety of uses. Some of these products include alcoholic beverages,pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents etc.
A.  Alcoholic beverages
All alcoholic beverages commonly contain the alcohol known as ethanol . The ethanol
content of all alcoholic beverages is not the same. Some beverages contain smallconcentrations of ethanol while others contain higher concentrations. These alcoholicbeverages can be either undistilled or distilled. The undistilled alcoholic beverages includebeer, wine, “Tella”, ‘Tej’ etc while ouzo, gin, brandy, whisky, ‘Katikalla’, and vodka areamong the distilled alcoholic beverages.
Beer: Beer is one of the alcoholic beverages widely manufactured and consumed in
most parts of the world. The common raw materials for its production are barleyand hops. Although the types of beer produced in the world are very many, the
average beer has alcohol content between 3-6 percent by volume.
Wine: Wine is another undistilled alcoholic beverage. The most common raw material for
producing wine are grapes . In the production process, grapes are first crushed and
then steamed. The liquid derived from crushing is called must. It then goes to a
fermentation tank where fermentation takes place. Then it passes to a settling tank,where sediments are allowed to settle, and it proceeds from there to a filter. Theclear liquid is cooled in a refrigerator and is pasteurized as it passes through a flashpasteurizer. Most wines have an alcohol content varying from 10-15% by volume.
Liquor: Compared with beer and wine, liquor contains higher concentrations of ethanol. It
is not possible to obtain an alcoholic beverage of more than 15% alcohol by volumethrough fermentations. This is because the yeast cells are not able to stay alive inalcohol of higher concentration. To get alcoholic beverages with higher percentagesof alcohol, the alcohol must be separated from the solution by distillation.
The alcoholic beverages like ouzo, gin, cognac, whisky etc, are made by distillation. Different
types of liquors have different alcohol concentrations. In most distilled alcoholic beveragesthe percentage ranges between 30-45% alcohol by volume. However, some alcoholicbeverages like Araki are expected to have a higher percentage of ethanol.
B.  Pharmaceuticals
Organic chemicals are used to manufacture drugs and medicines for various uses. Thesedrugs and medicines are collectively known as pharmaceuticals . Some of the
pharmaceuticals are:
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
80Analgesics: These are substances that reduce pain. For example: aspirin and
paracetamol.
Antiseptics: These are substances that help to prevent infections in wounds by killing
bacteria; for example, acriflavine.
Sedatives: These are drugs that make a person go to sleep or make them feel calm
and relaxed. Examples of such type of medicines are the barbiturates,which include several important drugs.
Disinfectants: These are substances used to disinfect something or to kill bacteria; for
example, Dettol.
Sulphonamides: These are medicines used as antibiotics. For example: penicillin.
C.  Soaps and Detergents
Organic chemicals are used for the synthesis of soaps and detergents. For example, animal
fat and vegetable oils are used for manufacturing soap. Fats and oils are naturally occurringesters of glycerol and the higher fatty acids. Long open-chain alcohols and alkyl benzenesulphonic acid can be used for the production of detergents.
Soaps and detergents are substances used to remove dirt. They are also called surfactants
or surface active agents. This is because they reduce the surface tension of water andchange the surface properties.
Soaps are either sodium or potassium salts of higher ( long-chain ) carboxylic acids. Soaps
that are sodium salts are called hard soaps and those that are potassium salts are soft
soaps . Soaps are prepared by boiling animal fat or vegetable oil with a base. The reaction
that produces soap is called saponification .
Example
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
81Detergents contain either a sulfate or a sulphonate group. One example of detergents is
sodium lauryl sulfate, C12 H25 — O — SO2 — ONa. It is prepared first by reacting
dodecyl (lauryl) alcohol with sulphuric acid followed by reaction withsodium hydroxide.
The reaction equation is:

Preparation of Soap
Objective: To prepare soap from animal fat or vegetable oil.
Materials required: Animal fat or vegetable oil, NaOH, NaCl, measuring cylinder,
beaker, glass rod, Bunsen burner, filter paper, funnel, conical flask, andtest tube.
Procedure:
Measure 3 mL vegetable oil or 3 g animal fat and place it in a 100 mL beaker; add
3 mL of ethanol and 3 mL of 5M NaOH. Stir the mixture vigorously with a glassrod and gently heat over a flame for 15 minutes or until it turns in to a paste. Whenthe paste begins to form, stir very carefully to prevent frothing. After all the pastehas formed, set the beaker on the bench to cool. Add about 15 mL of saturatedNaCl solution to the paste mixture and stir thoroughly. This process is called saltingout the soap. Filter off the soap mixture by suction filtration and wash the collectedsoap precipitate with 15 mL of ice water.
Observations and analysis:
aWhy do we add ethanol during the preparation?
bWhat is the purpose of adding saturated NaCl solution to the paste mixture?
Write a laboratory report and present to the class.      Experiment 1.9
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
82D.  Dry Cleaning
The qualities of some clothes decrease when they are washed with water using ordinary
soap. In order to avoid this, other chemicals are used for washing purposes that remove
dirt in the same manner as soaps. Dry cleaning refers to the use of different chemicalsthat are capable of dissolving grease and other dirt stains in a similar manner as soapswithout the use of water. The most commonly used chemicals in dry cleaning are organicchemicals such as tetrachloromethane , CCl
4; tetrachloroethylene , Cl2C = CCl2; benzene
and gasoline .
E.  Fuels
The term fuel refers to any material that is capable of burning to produce energy, heat and
light. Most fuels occurring in nature are organic compounds. However, some inorganic
substances like hydrogen, producer gas and water gas are also used as gaseous fuels. But,the most widely used fuels at present are of organic origin. This includes petroleum whichchiefly contains alkanes. Natural gas which is used as a fuel for stoves contains mainlymethane. Gasoline which is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines also containsalkanes. Paraffin wax which is used to make candles is another fuel to get light energy and
it is a mixture of alkanes containing more than twenty carbon atoms. Besides its use as a
constituent of all alcoholic beverages, ethanol can also be used as a fuel for internalcombustion engines. At present, it is one of the substances that we can rely on for use as afuel for automobiles. The use of ethanol as a fuel is now practiced in our country by mixingit with petrol. Ethanol and other plant seed oils can be classified as bio fuels.
Agricultural Applications
Organic compounds also play an important role in agriculture, specially to increase crop
productivity by controlling the damages caused by insects, rodents, fungi, birds and weeds.
So, organic chemicals can be used in the manufacture of pesticides and herbicides.
What is the distinction between herbicides and pesticides?Pesticides  are the chemicals used for controlling the damage that can be caused by fungi,
insects and other pests that attack crops. Among the pesticides, Bordeaux mixture is usedas fungicide. Other chemicals like DDT, aldrine, dieldrine, malathion are used as insecticides.
Herbicides  are the chemicals that are applied on agricultural lands to remove unwanted
plants or weeds. Some examples of compounds that are used as herbicides include paraquat,diquat, ammonium sulphamate, ammonium glyphosinate, sodium chlorate etc.
Fertilizers:  In order to increase crop productivity we use either synthetic or natural
fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers are grouped into three classes as nitrogen, potash and
phosphate fertilizers. Nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients. It is absorbed by
plants in the form of nitrate ion, NO
–
3 . Nitrogen enables green plants to synthesize amino
acids and proteins, and it is also a constituent of DNA molecules. To provide nitrogen for
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
83plants, nitrogen-containing fertilizers are usually added to the soil. These include, ammonium
salts like NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4; nitrates like KNO3 and urea. Urea is one of the most important
nitrogen fertilizers. It is a component of urine. On an industrial scale, urea is manufacturedby the dehydration of ammonium carbamate:
It can also be prepared by direct combination of ammonia and carbon dioxide at180°C and pressure of about 140 atm.

2.1  INTRODUCTION
Competencies
By completing this section, you will be able to:
• define inorganic compounds; and
• classify inorganic compounds as oxides, acids, bases and salts.
In the laboratory, take samples of different compounds and classify them as organic and
inorganic. When these compounds are burnt in air, it has been found that most organic
compounds burn when heated in air, but most inor ganic compounds just melt or vaporize;
why? Discuss your observations in groups and share your opinion with the class.
Inorganic compounds are the compounds consisting of mineral constituents of the earth
or generally found in non-living things. The term inorganic compound refers to allcompounds that do not contain carbon. Although, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are carbon-containing compounds, which areclassified as inorganic compounds. Inorganic compounds are mostly found in nature assilicates, oxides, carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, chlorides and nitrates, etc.
There are different ways for the classification of inorganic compounds. They can be
classified on the bases of their composition. For example; they can be classified onthe basis of the:
i)metal they contain such as copper compounds, aluminium compounds, etc.

gases and inactive metals like gold, platinum, and palladium. Such compounds of oxygenare called oxides . Oxides are binary compounds containing oxygen and any other
element ( metal, non-metal or metalloid ). Binary compounds  are those consisting of

Al2O3, sulphur dioxide, SO2, and carbon monoxide, CO.
The classification of oxides into different groups is based on their chemical behaviour;
they are classified as:
• Acidic oxides

A  Acidic Oxides
Acidic oxides are the oxides formed by the chemical combination of oxygen with non-
metals. Thus, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. These oxides are also called acid
anhydrides , since they form acidic solutions when reacted or dissolved in water. Acid
anhydride means acid without water.
Activity 2.2
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
95Generally speaking, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. Examples of acidic oxides
include carbon dioxide, CO2, nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and sulphur dioxide, SO2.
However, it is very important to note that all non-metal oxides are not necessarilyacidic oxides. For example, carbon monoxide, CO, and di-nitrogen monoxide, N
2O,
are non-metal oxides, but they are neutral oxides which will be discussed later.
Chemical Properties of Acidic Oxides
Acidic oxides undergo the following reactions:
1.Acidic oxides ( acid anhydrides ) dissolve in water to form acidic solution ( acid).
Acid anhydride    +    water    Æ    Acid
Examples
CO2+     H2OÆ    H2CO3 (Carbonic acid )
N2O3+     H2OÆ    2HNO2 (Nitrous acid )
SO2+     H2OÆ    H2SO3 (Sulphurous acid )
2.Acidic oxides react with basic or metallic oxides to form salt.
Acidic oxide    +    Basic oxide    Æ    Salt
Examples
CO2+    Na2OÆ    N a2CO3
SO3+    CaO Æ    CaSO4
3.Acidic oxides react with bases to form salt and water. This reaction is called
neutralization reaction .

B.  Basic Oxides
Oxides that are composed of metals and oxygen are basic oxides. But, all metal oxides
are not necessarily basic oxides; for example Al2O3 and ZnO are amphoteric oxides,
which will be discussed in part (C).
Oxides of metals that dissolve in water and react with it to form basic or alkaline solutions
are called basic anhydrides . There are metallic oxides which have basic properties but
are insoluble in water. These oxides react with acids to give salt and water.
Example
FeO    +    2HCl    Æ    FeCl2    +    H2O
The oxides of active metals, group IA and heavier members of group IIA, dissolve in
water and readily form bases. The term base is used to describe both soluble and
insoluble basic oxides. Some examples of basic oxides are Li2O, Na2O, K2O, MgO,
CaO, BaO, and CuO.
Chemical Properties of Basic Oxides
What common reaction do basic oxides undergo?  What products do they form
in their reactions with water, acidic oxides and acids?
1.Basic oxides dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. As they dissolve, they
react with water to form the corresponding metal hydroxides.
Basic oxide    +    water    Æ    Base (Alkali)
Examples
Li2O + H2O Æ  2LiOH
CaO + H2O Æ Ca(OH)2

Objective: To identify basic and acidic oxides.
Materials required:  Deflagrating spoon, gas jar and gas jar lid, test tubes.  Sulphur,
magnesium or calcium metal, water, universal indicator, litmus paper ( blue
and red).
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
98Procedure:
1.    Ignite a small amount of powdered sulphur on a deflagrating spoon and insert
in a gas jar of oxygen. Add 10 mL water after ignition is complete. Cover thegas jar with a lid and shake. Take two test tubes and pour 5 mL of thesolution to each test tube.  Add a few drops of universal indicator solution tothe first test tube and blue litmus paper in the second.
2. Ignite a small amo unt of magnesium or calcium metal on a deflagrating spoon and
insert in to a gas jar of oxygen. Add 10 mL water to the ash formed and shake. Take
two test tubes and pour 5 mL of the solution to each of the test tubes. Add a few
drops of universal indicator in the first and red litmus paper to th e second test tube.
Observations and analysis:a What compounds are formed by the combustion of sulphur and magnesium or
calcium? Write chemical equations to show the reactions.
b What happens when water is added to the gas jars in which sulphur was burnt?
c What colours are observed by adding drops of universal indicator and blue or
red litmus to the solutions in the test tubes?
d Why does the change in the colour of indicators occur in the various solutions?
Write a laboratory report and submit to your teacher.
Universal indicator  and litmus paper serve as indicators. Indicators  are substances
used to identify whether a given solution is acidic or basic by showing colour changes.Table 2.1  shows some common indicators and the colour they develop in acidic and
basic solutions.
Table 2.1   Some common indicators and their colours in acidic and basic solution.
Indicator Col our in aqueous solution Colour in aqueous

Universal      Indicator Yellow – Orange ( in weakly acidic ) Blue ( in weakly basic ) and
and red ( in strongly acidic ) purple ( in strongly basic )
Litmus Red Blue
Phenolphthalein  Colourless Pink ( red)
Methyl orange  Red Yellow
In addition to their effects on indicators, acidic and basic oxides can be identified by their
chemical properties. Acidic oxides react with bases while basic oxides react with acids.But acidic oxides do not react with acids and basic oxides do not react with bases.

99C.  Amphoteric Oxides
Activity 2.3
1. How would you classify the oxides of period III elements?
2. What trend do you observe in the properties of oxides of the elements in a period as
you go from left to right in the periodic table?
Discuss this in your group and present to the class.
There are oxides which exhibit both acidic and basic properties. These are known as
amphoteric oxides . In their reaction with acids, they behave as bases and, in their
reaction with bases they act as acids. The following reaction shows the amphotericbehaviour of aluminium oxide, Al
2O3.
Amphoteric oxide + Acid Æ salt + water
Al2O3 (s) + 6HCl (aq) Æ 2AlCl3 (aq) + 3H2O (l)
Amphoteric oxide + base Æ salt + water
Al2O3 (s) + 2NaOH (aq) Æ 2NaAlO2 (aq) + H2O (l)
sodium aluminate
Some other examples of amphoteric oxides are ZnO, PbO, PbO2, SnO, and SnO2. It
is also important to realize that hydroxides which react with both acids and bases aredescribed as amphoteric substances. For example, aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)
3, reacts
with both acids and bases to form salt and water. So, Al(OH)3, is amphoteric in nature.
What is the common characteristic of acidic, basic and amphoteric oxides?  Acidic
oxides form salts when reacted with basic oxides and bases. Basic oxides also producesalts in their reactions with acidic oxides and acids. Amphoteric oxides form saltswhen they react with acids and bases. Thus, acidic oxides , basic oxides and amphoteric
oxides  are salt-forming oxides .

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
100Investigating Amphoteric Behaviour of Oxides
Objective:  To observe the amphoteric behaviour of Al2O3.
Materials required:        Spatula, reagent bottles, beakers, glass rod, Al
2O3, HCl, NaOH, Universal
indicator and water.
Procedure:
1.Prepare solutions by:
amixing 20 mL concentrated HCl and 80 mL water in one reagent bottle;
bdissolving 8 g NaOH in 100 mL water in another reagent bottle.
cAdd universal indicator to the acid and base, and observe the colour change.
2.Take two beakers and place a spatula full of Al2O3 in each of the beakers.
3.Pour the HCl solution (which you prepared) into one of the beakers and NaOH
solution into the other. Stir the mixture with a glass rod.
4.Add universal indicator in the two beakers and observe the colour change.
Observations and analysis:
1.Does Al2O3 react with the substances in both solutions?
2.What does the change in colour of the indicator in the mixtures indicate?
3.Write chemical equations to show what has happened?
Write a laboratory report and present to the class.
D.  Neutral Oxides
Neutral oxides react neither with acids nor with bases to form salt and water. Hence,
neutral oxides do not show basic and acidic properties. Examples of neutral oxidesare water, H
2O, carbon monoxide, CO, dinitrogen monoxide, N2O, and nitrogen
monoxide, NO. Neutral oxides are very few in number.      Experiment 2.2

number of oxygen in this compound?

1012.If Na2O2 and CaO2 are reacted with water, do you get the same compound, which is
used to decolorize hair? Compare the oxidation number of oxygen in Na2O and MgO
with the oxidation number of the compound used for decolorizing hair.
Discuss your findings in group and present to the class.
E.  Peroxides
In acidic, basic, amphoteric and neutral oxides, the oxidation state of oxygen is –2,
but in peroxides it is –1. In peroxides, the two oxygen atoms are linked to each other
and with atoms of other elements. They contain the peroxide, “– O – O –” link. Inthe oxides discussed above, oxygen atoms are linked directly with atoms of other elements.
Some examples of peroxides are hydrogen peroxide, H
2O2, sodium peroxide, Na2O2,
calcium peroxide, CaO2, barium peroxide, BaO2, and strontium peroxide, SrO2.
Most peroxides of metals are formed by burning the metals in a sufficient amount of oxygen.
2Na (s) + O2 (g) Æ Na2O2 (s)
Ca (s) + O2 (g) Æ CaO2 (s)
Chemical Properties of Peroxides
What chemical properties do the peroxides exhibit?  Some of the chemical properties
of peroxides include:
aPeroxides are powerful oxidizing agents; they react with different substances
by losing oxygen.
Examples
PbS (s) + 4H2O2 (aq) Æ PbSO4 (s) +   4H2O (l)
2KI (aq)  +  H2SO4 (aq)  +  H2O2 (aq) Æ  I2 (s)  +  K2SO4 (aq)  +  2H2O (l)
b Peroxides react with aqueous acids to form hydrogen peroxide.
Hydrogen Peroxide
The structure of the hydrogen peroxide molecule is:Examples
Na2O2 (s) + 2HCl (aq) Æ 2NaCl (aq) + H2O2 (aq)
CaO2 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) Æ CaSO4 (s) + H2O2 (aq)
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
102Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to release oxygen. This reaction is slow but can be
speeded up by the addition of manganese (IV) oxide, MnO2, as a catalyst.
2H2O2 (aq)    Æ    2H2O (l)    +    O2 (g)
Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent. Its oxidizing power is responsible for
its effectiveness as an antiseptic for mouthwash and cleansing wounds. It is also usedas a bleaching agent. When hydrogen peroxide is added to a coloured dye, the moleculeresponsible for the colour will oxidize and so the colour will disappear. For example,if hydrogen peroxide is added to a black dye ( paint ) that contains lead sulphide, PbS,
the black colour turns white. This is due to the oxidation of PbS to PbSO
4. The
equation for this process is:
PbS (s)    +    4H2O2    Æ    PbSO4    +    4H2O (l)
Experiment 2.3

Activity 2.5
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
105Acids are among the most familiar of all chemical compounds.  Acetic acid in vinegar,
citric acid in lemons and other citrus fruits, are among the acids that we encounterevery day. Hydrochloric acid is the acid in gastric juice; it is essential to digestion.Phosphoric acid gives flavour to many carbonated beverages.
Definitions of Acids
a  Arrhenius Definition of Acids
The simplest definition of acids is suggested by Savante Arrhenius , a Swedish Chemist.
Arrhenius  defined an acid as a substance that releases hydrogen ion or proton, H+, or
hydronium ion, H3O+, in aqueous solution.
Example
HCl(aq) Æ H+(aq) + Cl–(aq)
or,HCl(aq) + H
2O(l) Æ H3O+(aq) + Cl–(aq)
Some examples of Arrhenius acids are HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, HI, HBr, and HF. For a
substance to be called an Arrhenius acid , it should contain ionizable hydrogen.
Despite its early success and usefulness, the definition of an acid, first proposed by
Arrhenius has some limitations. The Arrhenius definition of acids explains their behaviouronly in aqueous solution. In addition, it does not explain why some substances showacidic behaviour in the gaseous state and in non-aqueous solutions.
For example, when ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases are brought together, they
react to form ammonium chloride as follows:
NH
3 (g)    +    HCl (g)    Æ    NH4Cl (s)
In this reaction, the hydrogen chloride provides hydrogen ion (or proton), H+, which
reacts with NH3 to form NH4+. But, this happens in the gaseous state not in aqueous
solution. Due to the limitations of Arrhenius’ definition, chemists tried to define acids ina more general way.
Brønsted-Lowry Definition of Acids
A broader and more general definition of acids was provided independently in 1923,by Johannes Brønsted  and Thomas M. Lowry . According to Brønsted-Lowry definition;
an acid is a substance that donates protons, H
+, to some other substance.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
106Examples
HCl (aq) + H2O (l) Æ H3O+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)
NH3 (aq) + H2O (l) U NH4 + (aq) + OH– (aq)
H3PO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l)U HPO2–
4  (aq) + 2H3O+ (aq)
In the above reactions, HCl in the first, H2O in the second and H3PO4 in the third
are Brønsted-Lowry  acids because they are proton donors. Here it is very important
to realize that all Arrhenius acids are Brønsted-Lowry  acids. However, the reverse
is not true because Brønsted-Lowry  acids include substances that are not acids
according to Arrhenius.
Although the Brønsted-Lowry  definition of an acid is more general than the definition
proposed by Arrhenius, it still depends on the transfer of protons. However, thepresence of acids that are not proton-donors, initiated chemists to search for anotherdefinition of acids.
b  Lewis Definition of Acids
In 1923, the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis produced a definition of acid
that extends the concept of acids even further than that of Brønsted-Lowry .
According to Lewis , an acid is a substance that can form a coordinate covalent
bond by accepting an electron pair from another  substance. In other words, an
acid is an electron-pair acceptor . Consider the following reactions:
In the above reaction, between BF3 and F–, BF3 acts as a Lewis acid  since it accepts
a pair of electrons from F–.
The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Arrhenius concept of an acid.
This is because as the acid releases an hydrogen ion, H+, in aqueous solution, the
released proton or H+ accepts a pair of electrons from a water molecule to form an
hydronium, H3O+ ion.
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
107The Lewis definition of an acid is also valid for the Brønsted-Lowry  concept of
acids. Since Brønsted-Lowry  defined an acid as a proton donor, the donated proton
can be accepted by a molecule or species that has lone pair of electrons. So theproton, H
+, is an electron pair acceptor and hence a Lewis acid . Consider the
following reaction.
NH3 (g)    +    H2O (l)    U    NH4+ (aq)    +    OH– (aq)
In this reaction, H2O is a proton donor and hence a  Brønsted-Lowry acid. The donated
proton from water to ammonia, accepts a pair of electrons from the nitrogen atom inNH
3 to form NH4+ as shown below:
The Lewis concept of acids not only includes  H+ as an acid, but also ions or molecules
capable of accepting an electron pair that neither release H+ in aqueous solution nor
donate a proton.
Classification of Acids
Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, has three hydrogen atoms and it is a triprotic acid. Acetic acid,
CH3COOH, has four hydrogen atoms and is classified as a monoprotic acid. Discuss the
reason in your group and present it to the class.
There are different ways of classifying acids; they can be classified depending on the
number of replaceable ( ionizable ) hydrogen atom(s) they contain per molecule as
monoprotic or polyprotic acids .
Monoprotic acids are the acids containing only one ionizable (replaceable)
hydrogen atom per molecule or those acids that can furnish only one hydrogen
Activity 2.6
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
108ion per molecule in aqueous solution . Common examples of monoprotic acids are
HCl, HNO3, HBr, HI, and CH3COOH. The ionization of a monoprotic acid in aqueous

HNO3 (aq)Æ     H+ (aq) + NO3– (aq)
Polyprotic acids are those acids containing more than one ionizable ( replaceable )
hydrogen ion in aqueous solution. Example of acids in this category includes H2SO4,
H2CO3, and H3PO4.
The ionization of polyprotic acids in aqueous solution is shown in the following chemical
equations:
H2SO4 (aq)Æ 2H+ (aq) + SO42– (aq)
H2CO3 (aq)U 2H+ (aq) + CO32– (aq)
H3PO4 (aq)U 3H+ (aq) + PO43– (aq)
Polyprotic acids which contain two ionizable hydrogen atoms such as H2SO4, H2S,
and H2CO3 are also called diprotic acids ;  those containing three ionizable hydrogen
atoms like H3PO4 are called triprotic acids .
Activity 2.8
Activity 2.7
Ammonia and phosphoric acid have three hydrogen atoms but ammonia does not behave
as triprotic acid. Why? Discuss in your group and present it to the class.
Acids can also be classified depending on the number of their constituent elements as
binary and ternary acids . Binary acids are those acids composed of only two elements.
Examples of binary acids are HCl, HBr, HF, HI, and H2S.
Ternary acids also called oxy-acids are acids composed of three different elements.
They usually contain hydrogen, oxygen and a non-metal. Examples are H2SO4, H2CO3,
HClO4, and H3PO4.
General Properties of Acids
Add a drop of lemon juice on your tongue and try to identify its taste. Repeat your
observation with orange juice. Do the two juic es taste bitter or sour? Try to classify them
as acid or base, depending on their taste. Share your observations with the rest of class.
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
109Acids generally have the following properties:
1.Acids have a sour taste
Aqueous solutions of acids have a sour taste. Lemon juice and orange juice taste
sour due to the presence of citric acid. Citric acid is harmless. However, mostconcentrated acids are corrosive and poisonous. So it is strictly forbidden to attemptto identify such acids by tasting them.
2.  Acids change the colour of indicators
The common indicators available in high school laboratories are litmus,
phenolphthalein, methyl orange or methyl red and universal indicator. The effect ofacids on the colour of indicators is summarized in Table2.1 , Section 2.2 .
Experiment 2.4

1103.Acids react with active metals to form salt and hydrogen gas
Metals like magnesium, zinc, and iron react with dilute acids to form salt and liberate
hydrogen gas.

Examples
2HCl + Zn Æ ZnCl2+H2
H2SO4+M g Æ MgSO4+H2
Very active metals like sodium, potassium, and calcium react very violently with dilute
acids. The reaction is very dangerous and should not be performed.
Acids reacting with metals do not necessarily produce hydrogen gas. For example,
concentrated nitric acid and hot concentrated sulphuric acid react with copper producing
nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide gases, respectively, instead of hydrogen. This isbecause concentrated HNO
3 and hot concentrated H2SO4 are oxidizing acids. The
reactions of these acids with copper are given by the following equations:
Cu + 4HNO3Æ Cu(NO3)2+ 2NO2+2 H2O
Cu + 2H2SO4Æ CuSO4+S O2+2 H2O

Strength of Acids (Strong and Weak Acids )
1.Add a few drops of citric acid solution and nitric acid separately on a piece of waste
cotton cloth; what happens? Based on your observations, can you classify these acids as
weak acid or strong acid?
2. You are allowed to taste some acids like acetic acid (in the form of vinegar), and citric
acid at home, but you are never allowed to  taste any kind of acids in the laboratory.
What is the reason?
Discuss your findings  in your group and present to the class.
Acids can be classified as strong acids and weak acids depending on their degree of
ionization in aqueous solution , i.e., the extent to which the acids dissociate to form
hydrogen or hydronium ions when they dissolve in water. A strong acid is one that
ionizes almost completely in aqueous solution. Examples of strong acids are HClO4,
HI, HBr, HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4. These acids dissociate to a very high extent as
shown below:
HCl (aq) Æ H+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)
HNO3 (aq) Æ H+ (aq) + NO3– (aq)
HClO4 (aq) Æ H+(aq) + ClO4– (aq)
A dilute aqueous solution of strong acids contains predominantly the ions derived from
the acids instead of the acid molecules. For example, HCl and HNO3 are almost
completely ionized in water.
Activity 2.9
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
115An acid that releases few hydrogen ions in aqueous solution is a weak acid. The
aqueous solution of a weak acid contains hydronium ions, anions and dissolvedmolecules of the acid.
Organic acids which contain the acidic carboxyl group –COOH, are generally weak
acids. For example, CH
3COOH, ionizes slightly in water to give hydronium ions and
acetate ions, CH3COO–.
CH3COOH (aq)  +  H2O(l)  U  CH3COO– (aq) + H3O+(aq)
Concentrated and Diluted Acids
1.In a solution, if there is 95% H2O and the rest is HCl, what kind of solution is it?
2.In a car battery, the electrolyte used is 35% of H2SO4. How many percent of it is water?
What do you think about the concentration of the electrolyte?
“Concentrated” and “dilute” are terms used to describe the relative amount of acid in
a given acid solution.
A concentrated acid contains a relatively large amount ( percentage ) of acid and a
small amount of water. For example, concentrated sulphuric acid is 98% H2SO4 and
2% water. Concentrated acetic acid is 99% acetic acid and 1% water. But, H2SO4 is
a strong acid and CH3COOH a weak acid.
A dilute acid contains a relatively small amount of acid dissolved in large amount of
water. For example, a diluted solution of sulphuric acid may contain 10% H2SO4 and
90% H2O.
The concentration of an acid is the measure of the number of moles of the acid in one
litre of acid solution and is expressed in mol/L. This unit of concentration is calledMolarity , denoted by M. Mathematically,
Molarity (M) = Number of moles of thesubstance dissolved
Volume of solution in litres
Number of moles of the substance = Mass of the substance dissolved in grams
Molar mass of the substance
For example, the concentration of 98% H2SO4 is about 18 mol/L. If one litre of this
acid is added to 2 litres of water to make 3 litres of solution, the concentration will
Activity 2.10
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
116become 6 mol/L. The new solution obtained is a dilute solution of H2SO4. Thus,
concentrated acids contains a greater number of moles of acid while dilute acids containless number of moles of the acid per litre of the acid solution.
Example
How many moles of HCl are present in 0.8 L of a 0.5 M HCl solution?
Solution:
M = n
V ﬁ n = MV = 0.5 M × 0.8 L = 0.4 mol HCl, where M is the
molarity, n, the number of moles and V, volume of solution in litre.
An important aspect of the property of acids is that they conduct electricity  in aqueous
solutions, i.e., the acids are electrolytes. The extent of conduction of electricity depends
on the amount of ions present in the solution. Thus, aqueous solutions of strong acids
are better conductors of electricity than the same concentrations of weak acid solutions.The conduction of electricity through acid solution is also used as one means of
identification between weak and strong acids.
Experiment 2.8
Can Aqueous Acid Solution Conduct Electricity?
Objectives: To investigate the conductivity of acids

through HCl solution by inserting the two graphite electrodes. See whether the
bulb glows or not. Is the light bright or dim? Record your observation. Repeatthe same activity with HNO
3 and CH3COOH. Rinse the electrodes after use
in each of the acid solutions. Compare the intensity of light produced with

Precautions when Handling Acids
Concentrated acids are extremely corrosive and poisonous. They can destroy metals
and clothes; produce a chemical burn on skin or inside the body. If taken internallythey can be fatal. So acids must be handled with care.
The following precautions are helpful while working with acids:
aWear goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat.
bIf a concentrated acid is spilled or splashed on your body, first wash the affected
part with running water and then with 10%  Na
2CO3 solution.
cIf concentrated acid is spilled on to clo th, immediately wash it with running water.
dIf an acid enters your eye, wash with water repeatedly and then consult a doctor.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
118eIf corrosive acids are swallowed, administer weak bases such as Mg(OH)2 or
Al(OH)3.
fUse bellows to pipette acid instead of sucking using yours lips.
gTo dilute concentrated acids, pour the concentrated acid in to water and not
water in to the acid.
pH and pH scale
Expressing acidity as the concentration of H3O+ can be cumbersome because the
values tend to be very small. A more convenient quantity called pH is used to indicatethe concentration of H
3O+. The letter pH stands for the French words pouvoir
hydrogène , meaning “hydrogen power”.
pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the  hydrogen ion  concentration ( hydronium
ion concentration ). The mathematical expression is:
pH = log 1
[]H+ = – log [H+]
The square bracket [ ] means concentration in mol/L.
To calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution from its pH we can proceed
as follows.
[H+] = antilog (–pH) = 10–pH
The pH of a solution can be measured using universal indicator solution, pH indicator
paper or a pH-meter. When universal indicator solution or pH indicator papers areadded to an acid solution, they develop different colours depending on the pH of thesolution. So, to identify the pH, we need to compare the colour developed with thestandard colour chart. A pH meter is an electronic device, which reads the pH of asolution directly. ( Figure 2.3 ).

b ) A pH meter with its electrical probe dipped into an orange.ab
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
119Acidity and alkalinity are usually expressed on the pH scale. The range is between 0
and 14.
A neutral solution has a pH value of 7 at 298 K. Acidic solutions have pH values lessthan 7. As the pH value decreases the acidity of the solution increases. For example,if two solutions A and B have pH values of 4 and 6, respectively, then we can concludethat solution A is more acidic than solution B. The hydrogen ion concentration insolution A is one hundred times greater than that in B.
The following examples will guide us through how to calculate pH values of solutions.
Example
Calculate the pH of a 0.001 M solution of HCl?
Solution:
HCl is a strong acid and dissociates almost completely.The dissociation of 0.001 M (0.001 mol/L) of HCl produces 0.001 mol/L of
H
+ and 0.001 mol/L of Cl– as follows:
HCl (aq)    Æ    H+(aq)    +    Cl– (aq)
0.001 mol/L      0.001mol/L      0.001 mol/L
Thus, [H+] = 0.001 mol/L = 1 × 10–3 M
pH  = –log [H+]  = – log 1 × 10–3 = 3
Example
The hydrogen ion concentration in a dilute solution of vinegar is 4.6 × 10-5 M.
What is the pH of the solution?
Solution:
pH = – log [H+] = – log (4.6 × 10–5) = – (log 4.6 + log 10–5)
= – (log 4.6 – 5) = – (0.663 – 5) = 4.337
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
120Example
The pH of lemon juice was determined to be 3. What is the hydrogen ion
concentration in the lemon juice?
Solution:
pH = – log [H+]; –pH = log [H+]

Bases  belong to the class of inorganic compounds that include most oxides and
hydroxides of metals. They are of great importance in chemical industries and in ourdaily lives, directly or indirectly. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH is used in theproduction of soap, paper, textile etc. Potassium hydroxide, KOH is used to producesoft soap, fertilizers etc. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)
2, is used to manufacture mortar
and bleaching powder, to remove soil acidity etc.
Definition of Bases
There are different definitions of bases, as suggested by different chemists namely Arrhenius,
Bronsted-Lowry  and Lewis .
Activity 2.12
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
126Arrhenius  definition of bases: A base is any substance that ionizes (dissociates) in
aqueous solution to release hydroxide, OH– ions . Arrhenius bases are mostly ionic
metal hydroxides such as, LiOH, NaOH, KOH and Ba(OH)2. The dissociation of a
few bases is shown by the following equations:
NaOH (aq) Æ Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
Ba(OH)2 (aq) Æ Ba2+ (aq) + 2OH– (aq)
Brønsted-Lowry  definition of bases:  A base is a substance that is capable of
accepting proton(s), H+. Thus, a base is a proton, H+ acceptor .
Note:
Note that not all Brønsted-Lowry bases are Arrhenius bases, but all Arrhenius
bases contain the hydroxide ion which is a Brønsted-Lowry base. This is becauseOH
- can accept a proton, H+, to form water.
According to the  Brønsted-Lowry definition, an acid-base reaction is the transfer of a
proton from an acid to a base.

Lewis Definition of Bases
The Lewis definition is a more general definition than the Arrhenius and Brønsted-
Lowry definitions. According to Lewis , a base is a substance that is capable of
donating a pair of electrons. In other words, a base is an electron-pair donor .
Brønsted-Lowry  bases are also bases according to the Lewis concept. This is
because for Brønsted-Lowry bases to accept a proton, H+ they should have a
lone pair. However, Lewis base include other species that can form a coordinate
covalent bond by sharing their lone pair with substances other than a proton, H+.
It is important to note that Lewis acid-base reactions include many reactions that
do not involve protons. The following equation shows an acid-base reaction
according to Lewis concept:

General Properties of Bases
Activity 2.13
Dissolve one table-spoon of washing soda in a glass of water. Try to wash your hands withthis solution. How do you feel? Does it give a soapy touch or an oily touch. Share your
observations with the rest of the class.
Activity 2.14
Bases like NaOH, KOH, and Ba(OH)2 are readily soluble in water, while o thers such as
Mg(OH)2 are slightly soluble. Bases that are soluble in water are also called alkalis .
Bases or alkalis show the following properties:
1. Bases are slippery to the touch and have a bitter taste:  Bases have a bitter
taste; feel slippery to the skin in dilute aqueous solutions.  Strong bases such asNaOH and KOH are very corrosive and poisonous. So they should be neitherbrought in to contact with the skin nor tasted.
2. Soluble bases change the colour of indicators:  Aqueous solutions of bases
turn the colour of red litmus to blue, phenolphthalein to pink ( red), methyl red to
yellow and universal indicator blue ( purple ).
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
1283. Soluble bases release hydroxide ion in aqueous solution:  The characteristic
properties of bases in aqueous solutions are due to the presence of the hydroxideion, OH
– which they release on dissolution.
Examples
KOH (aq) Æ K+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
Ca(OH)2 (aq)U Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH– (aq)
4. Bases neutralize acids or acidic oxides to form salt and water:
Base    +    Acid (or acidic oxide)    Æ    Salt    +    Water
Examples
2NaOH (aq) + H2SO4 (aq) Æ Na2SO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l)
2KOH (aq) + SO3 (g) Æ K2SO4 (aq) + H2O (l)
Ca(OH)2 (aq) + 2HCl (aq) Æ CaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l)
5. Aqueous solutions of bases conduct electricity:  Soluble bases are electrolytes.
Solutions of strong bases are good conductors while solutions of weak bases arepoor conductors.
Strength of Bases (Strong and Weak Bases )
Activity 2.15
Is a concentrated base a strong base and a dilute base a weak base?  Discuss in your
group and present to the class.
Both acids and bases are classified as strong and weak depending on their degree of
ionization ( dissociation ) in aqueous solution.
Strong bases are those which ionize ( dissociate ) completely or almost completely in
water solutions. Examples of strong bases include hydroxides of alkali (Group IA)
metals and lower members of alkaline earth metals such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, andBa(OH)
2.
Examples
LiOH (aq) Æ Li+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
KOH (aq) Æ K+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
IMPORTANT INOGANIC COMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
129Weak bases are those bases which ionize ( dissociate ) only partially or slightly in aqueous
solution. Examples of weak bases include NH3, and Ca(OH)2.
The dissociation of a weak base can be shown as follows using, NH3, as an example.
NH3 (g)    +    H2O (l)    U    NH4+ (aq)    +    OH– (aq)
The double arrow shows that the dissociation of a weak base does not proceed to
completion. This means an aqueous solution of a weak base contains only a smallamount of ions derived from the dissociation of the base and a large amount of the
non-ionized base. For example, a solution of ammonia containing 0.1 mole NH
3 per
litre of solution ionizes only to the extent of 1.3%.
Concentrated and Dilute Bases
Concentrated and dilute solutions are terms used to describe the amount of a substance
present in a given volume of solution. The amount can be described in terms of either
percentage or number of moles. Concentrated bases contain relatively large amountsof a base in a given volume of solution while dilute base solutions contain only a small
amount of base. The concentration of a base is the measure of the number of moles
of the alkali ( base) dissolved in one litre of solution.  The concentration is expressed
in terms of mole per litre ( Molarity ).
Molarity of the base = number of moles of the base
volume of solution in litres
The greater the number of moles of the base per litre of the solution the more
concentrated is the solution. For example, a solution containing ten moles of NaOH
per litre is more concentrated than the solution containing two moles of NaOH per
litre. The latter solution is more dilute than the former. Thus, both a strong base and aweak base may be concentrated or dilute depending on the number of moles of thebase present per litre.
Precautions when Handling Bases
Strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide can attack humanskin, and even damage animal and plant tissues. That is why NaOH and KOH are
named caustic soda and caustic potash respectively. The word “caustic” refers to a
substance that can cause burning. Thus, it is very important to avoid the contact ofbases with any part of our body or clothing. Not only strong bases but weak basesare also corrosive. For example, concentrated ammonia solution can cause blindness ifsplashed into the eye.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
130The following safety precautions are useful in handling bases in school laboratories or
anywhere while working with them.
aWear eye goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat.
bIf bases are spilled on your working table wipe the spillages immediately.
cWhenever bases are splashed on your cloth, wash the affected part with running
water.
dIf a base enters your eyes, wash with water repeatedly as first aid treatment
and seek medical advice.
eIf a base is swallowed by accident, drink 1-2% acetic acid or lemon juice
immediately.
fWhenever bases come in to contact with your skin, wash the affected part with
plenty of water and then wash the affected part with a very dilute solution ( about
1%) of a weak acid such as acetic acid.
pOH
1.Since water, H2O, has H+ and OH–, it is both acidic and basic. Is this true?
2.If [OH–] increases in a solution what happens to its [H+]? Share your comments with
your group.
pH is the measure of the hydrogen (H+) or hydronium (H3O+) ion concentration in a
solution. In the same manner, pOH is the measure of the hydroxide, OH– ion
concentration in a solution. It also measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution as
pH does.
pOH is defined as the negative logarithm of hydroxide, OH” ion concentration.
pOH = –log [OH–]
To calculate the hydroxide ion concentration from a given pOH value, we proceed as
follows:
[OH–] = antilog (–pOH) = 10–pOH
Relationship Between pH and pOH
How can you derive the mathematical relationship between pH and pOH ? To
understand the relationship between pH and pOH let us start from the ionization of
water. Water undergoes ionization to a small extent as follows:
H2O (l)U H+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
Activity 2.16
IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
131or
2H2O (l)U H3O+ (aq) + OH– (aq)
We can write a mathematical expression for the ionic product of water or dissociation
constant for water, Kw as
Kw = [H+] [OH–] = [H3O+] [OH–] (2.1)
Kw = 1.0 × 10–14 (mol/L)2 at  25°C
Since water is neutral, [H+] = [OH–] or [H3O+] = [OH–]. So we can write equation
2.1 as
Kw = [H+] [OH–] = [H+]2 = 1.0 × 10–14(mol/L)2
Solving for [H+]
[H+] = ()2–14 –7mol 1.0 × 10 = 1.0 × 10 mol/LL
Thus, in any neutral aqueous solution at 25°C,
[H+] = [OH–] = 1.0 × 10–7 mol/L
In an acid solution, [H+] > [OH–] and in a basic solution, [OH–] > [H+]. However,
the product [H+] × [OH–] remains constant, i.e., 1.0 × 10–14 at 25°C. Thus, if the
concentration of either H+ or OH– is known in a given solution, we can calculate the
concentration of the other.
[OH–] =WK
+[H ];  [ H+] =W
–K
[OH ]
To find the relationship between pH and pOH let us begin with equation 2.1.
Kw = [H+] [OH–] = 1.0 × 10–14 (mol/L)2
Take the negative logarithm of both sides
–log Kw = –log [H+] [OH–] = –log 1.0 × 10–14
–log Kw = –log [H+] + (–log [OH–]) = –log 1.0 ×10–14
but, –log Kw = pKw,
–log [OH–] = pOH,
–log [H+] = pH
–log 1.0 × 10–14 = 14
So, the above equation becomes
pkw = pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)                                                     (2.2)
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
132Thus, the sum of pH and pOH is 14 for any aqueous solution, at 25°C. Since pH,
pOH, [H+] and [OH–] are interrelated through Kw, knowing any one of the values
enables us to determine the others.
Table 2.2:  Acidity and Basicity in relation to [H+], [OH–], pH and pOH.

Example
The hydroxide ion concentration in a solution is 5.0 × 10–5M? Calculate:
apOH b[H+] cpH
Solution:
aTo calculate pOH we proceed as follows.
pOH =  – log [OH–] = – log (5 ×10–5) = – (log10–5 – log 5)
= 5 – log 5 = 4.3
b[H+] is calculated using the relationship
[H+] =W
–K
[OH ]  = 2 –14

5.0×10  mol/L = 2.0 × 10–10 M
cpH = –log [H+] = –log 2.0 × 10–10
= 10 – log 2 = 9.7
Since the pOH of the solution is found in part (a), we can also calculate thepH using the relationshippH + pOH = 14pH + 4.3 = 14pH = 14 – 4.3 = 9.7

3.Which salts are found in Dalol area, Ethiopia?
Salts are ionic compounds that contain positive ions (cations) derived from bases and
negative ions (anions) derived from acids. Salts are also defined as ionic compoundsformed when the ionizable hydrogen of acids are partly or completely replaced bymetal ions or ammonium ions. For example, Ca(HCO
3)2 and CaCO3 are salts derived
from the acid H2CO3 while the salts Mg(H2PO4)2, MgHPO4 and Mg3(PO4)2 are
salts derived from H3PO4.
• A salt is produced when an acid is neutralized by a base:
Acid    +    Base    Æ    Salt    +    Water
Examples
HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) Æ NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)
H2SO4 (aq) + Ca(OH)2 (aq)Æ CaSO4(s) + 2H2O (l)
Some common examples of salts are sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium carbonate
(CaCO3), potassium nitrate (KNO3), copper sulfate (CuSO4) etc.

139bWhat would be the nature of the salt, if all the base hydroxide ions are not replaced by
the anions of the acid?
Discuss in your group and present the findings to the class.
Salts can be classified as:
•Acidic salts: These  are salts in which not all of the hydrogen ions in an acid have
been replaced by metal ions or ammonium (NH+
4) ions.
Example:    Sodium hydrogen sulphate, NaHSO4.
When acidic salts are dissolved to make an aqueous solution, they release H+
ions which make the solution acidic. For example, NaHSO4 releases ions in
aqueous solution as follows:
NaHSO4 (aq)    Æ    N a+ (aq)    +    H+ (aq)    +    SO2–
4  (aq)
•Normal salts:  These are salts in which all of the hydrogen ions in an acid
have been replaced by metal ions or ammonium ions.
Example:    Sodium sulphate, Na2SO4.
Normal salts do not contain ionizable H+ or OH–.
Example
Na2SO4 release ions as follows:
Na2SO4 (aq)    Æ    2 N a+ (aq)    +    SO2–
4  (aq)
•Basic salts:  These are salts in which not all of the hydroxide ions in a base
have been replaced by the anions of the acid.
Example:    Zinc hydroxychloride, Zn(OH)Cl.
When basic salts are dissolved to make an aqueous solution, they release OH–
ions and this makes the solution basic.Zn(OH)Cl (aq)    Æ    Zn
2+ (aq)    +    OH– (aq)    +    Cl– (aq)

140Salts can be prepared by the following methods:
1. Direct combination of elements:  This method is used to prepare binary
salts, that is, salts consisting of only two elements.
Examples
2Na (s) + Cl2 (g)Æ 2NaCl (s)
Fe (s) + S (s) Æ FeS (s)
Fe (s) + 3Cl2 (g)Æ 2FeCl3 (s)
2. Reacting active metals with dilute acids:
Active metal    +    Acid    Æ    Salt    +    Hydrogen gas
Examples
2Al (s) + 6HCl (aq) Æ 2AlCl3 (aq) + 3H2 (g)
Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq) Æ MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)
Zn (s) + H2SO4 (aq)Æ ZnSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)
Since, the reactions of metals of Group IA like sodium and potassium are very
vigorous, it is advisable not to use the metals of Group IA for the preparationof salts by this method.
Sometimes, the reaction of active metals with dilute acids to prepare salts may
not be as successful as expected. For example, calcium sulphate is only sparinglysoluble in water. So in the reaction with dilute sulphuric acid, calcium tends tobecome coated with calcium sulphate which inhibits the reaction from proceeding.
3. Reacting metal oxides with acids  (by neutralizing basic oxides with
dilute acids ):
Metal oxide    +    Dilute acid    Æ    Salt    +    Water
Examples
CaO (s) + 2HCl (aq) Æ CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l)
CuO (s) + H2SO4 (aq)Æ CuSO4 (aq) + H2O (l)
ZnO (s) + 2HNO3 (aq)Æ Zn(NO3)2 (aq) + H2O (l)

5. Reacting metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates with dilute acids:
The reaction of carbonates or hydrogen carbonates with dilute acids alwaysreleases carbon dioxide gas along with the formation of a salt and water.
Metal carbonates  +  Dilute acid  Æ  Salt  +  Water  +  Carbon dioxide
Examples
MgCO3 (s) + H2SO4 (aq)ÆMgSO4 (aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l)

Ca(HCO3)2 (s) + 2HCl (aq)ÆCaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) + 2CO2 (g)
6. Double decomposition reaction  (double displacement reaction ): In this
method, two different soluble salts react to form a soluble and an insoluble saltas products that can be separated easily.
Examples
Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + NaI (aq) Æ PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)
CaCl2 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq)Æ CaCO3 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)

every salt; i.e., different methods may be used to make different salts.

Properties of salts
Salts can be classified depending on the anion ( negative ion ) they possess, because
the anion is partly responsible for the solubility of the salt.
1.Solubility of salts. The following table summarizes some simple observations
about the solubility of some groups of salts.
Table 2.2   Solubility of salts.
Soluble salts Exceptions
 All nitrates (NO3–), perchlorates (ClO4–),  No exception
chlorates (ClO3–) and acetates
(CH3COO–)
 Most halides  Those containing Ag+, Hg2+, Pb2+
(AgCl, AgBr, AgI, HgCl2, HgBr2, HgI2, PbCl2, PbBr2,
PbI2) (PbCl2 is soluble in hot water)
 Most sulphates  BaSO4, HgSO4, PbSO4, SrSO4
 Carbonates (CO32–), phosphates (PO43–)  All carbonates, phosphates and

2.Tendency to absorb water from the atmosphere or release water to the
atmosphere.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
144Depending on their tendency to absorb water from or release water to the
atmosphere, salts can be classified as hygroscopic , deliquescent  and
efflorescent .
Hygroscopic salts  are those which absorb water from the atmosphere but remain
solid.
Deliquescent salts  absorb water from the atmosphere to form a solution. The
process of absorbing water from the atmosphere by a solid to form a solutionis called deliquescence .
Efflorescent salts  lose their water of crystallization to the atmosphere. The
loss of water of crystallization by solid crystals to the atmosphere is known asefflorescence .
It is very important to note that all deliquescent substances are hygroscopic,
but all hygroscopic substances are not necessarily deliquescent.
Table 2.3   Examples of hygroscopic, deliquescent and efflorescent salts.
Deliquescent Hygroscopic Effl orescent
 Calcium chloride , CaCl2 Anhydrous Copper( II)  Hydrated sodium
sulphate, CuSO4carbonate Na2CO310H2O
 Sodium Nitrate, NaNO3 Hydratedsodium sulphate,
Na2SO410H2O
 Iron (III) chloride, FeCl3
 Magnesium chloride, MgCl2
 Lithium nitrate, LiNO3
 Sodium nitrate, NaNO3
3.Aqueous solutions of soluble salts are good conductors of electricity, because
they release mobile positive and negative ions in solution.
Examples
NaNO3 (aq)Æ Na+ (aq) + NO3– (aq)
CaCl2 (aq)Æ Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl– (aq)
4.Thermal stability of salts:  When different salts containing the same anion
are heated, they may not show similar behaviour. Some salts are thermallystable while others undergo decomposition. The following examples illustratethis fact.
IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
145a Thermal decomposition of carbonates:
Carbonates are salts containing a carbonate, as an anion. Carbonates of Group
IIA and most transition metals decompose on heating to give the metal oxidesand carbon dioxide:
MgCO
3 (s)heat→ MgO (s) + CO2 (g)
CuCO3 (s)heat→ CuO (s) + CO2 (g)
However, carbonates of sodium and potassium are not decomposed by heat.
b Thermal decomposition of nitrates
Nitrates are salts containing a nitrate, as  an anion. Heating nitrates of Group IIA
and most transition metals produces a metal oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen:
Nitrate   heat→   Metal oxide   +   Nitrogen dioxide   +   Oxygen
Examples
2Mg(NO3)2 (s)heat→ 2MgO (s) + 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g)
2Pb(NO3)2 (s)heat→ 2PbO (s) + 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g)
Nitrates of sodium and potassium decompose on heating to give nitrites and
oxygen gas;
2NaNO3 (s)heat→ 2NaNO2 (s) + O2 (g)
2KNO3 (s)heat→ 2KNO2 (s) + O2 (g)
The carbonate and nitrate of lithium differ from those of sodium and potassium;
they decompose on heating in the following manner:
4LiNO3 (s)heat→ 2Li2O (s) + 4NO2 (s) + O2 (g)
Li2CO3 (s)heat→ Li2O (s) + CO2 (g)

1522.Plants need nitrogen for their growth, and there is plenty of nitrogen in the air. If this
is so, why do we apply nitrogeneous fertilizers for plants?
3.Some people prefer to eat organic food that has been grown without fertilizers and
pesticides. Does eating organic food overcome the problems caused by artificialfertilizers? Discuss in groups and present to the class.
The growth and development of plants is determined by various factors of soil, climate,
and by factors inherent in the plants themselves. Minerals required by plants for theirgrowth and development are called plant nutrients . For a soil to produce crops
successfully, it must have an adequate supply of all the necessary nutrients that plantstake from the soil. The required nutrient elements must be present in the soil in formsthat plants can use and also there should be a rough balance among them in accordancewith the amounts needed by plants. When any one of these elements is lacking or is inexcess of the required proportion, the normal plant growth will not take place.
Elements required by plants for their growth and development are called essential
nutrients. The elements considered as essential nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, boron,copper, zinc, molybdenum, cobalt and chlorine. All these seventeen elements havetheir own roles in the growth and development of plants. Depending on the amountrequired by plants, these elements are classified as macronutrients and micronutrients .
Try to identify the (a) micronutrients, (b) macronutrients, required for the growth of wheat,
maize, and rice crops, by consulting the books in your library. Share your findings with theclass.
Activity 2.23
Macronutrients  are the elements required in relatively large amounts by plants. These
are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, carbon, hydrogen andoxygen.
Micronutrients  are the elements required by plants in relatively small ( trace ) amounts.
These elements are iron, cobalt, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, copper, boron andchlorine.
The elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by plants from air and water.
These are not considered as mineral nutrients. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium
IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
153are said to be primary mineral nutrients. The roles of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
in the plant growth are discussed below:
Nitrogen  is a very important plant nutrient. It is absorbed by plants in the form of
nitrate ions (NO3–). In the growth and development of plants, nitrogen is utilized in the
synthesis of amino acids, proteins, coenzymes and nucleic acids. The proteins formedcontrol the metabolic processes that occur in plant cells. Nitrogen is also involved inthe synthesis of chlorophyll to produce a deep green colour.
Phosphorus  is an important element without which the growth of plants is impossible.
It facilitates early growth and root formation, quick maturity and promotes seed orfruit production. Phosphorus is absorbed by plants mainly in the form of H
2PO4– and
HPO32– in small amounts. Phosphorus has a role in the formation of some amino
acids and proteins, coenzymes, nucleic acids and high energy phosphate compoundslike Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
Potassium  is absorbed by plants in the form of the K
+ ion. It is a component of
enzymes that facilitate the process of photosynthesis and protein synthesis. It also adjustsstomata movement. It is the most important ion in controlling the turgidity of plant
cells. It increases in the solute potential ( sap concentration ) within the cells which
leads to an increase in the amount of water that enters the cells osmotically .
Exercise 2.12
1.What is the importance of the following elements for the growth of food crops?
anitrogen bphosphorus cpotassium
2.In what form do plants absorb these elements?
Fertilizers
During the growth and development of plants, the plants consume the essential nutrients
from the soil. The concentration of these nutrients will decrease in the soil. If theplants are specially food crops, the nutrients can be lost from the soil when the plantsare removed on harvest. So for the soil to be suitable for the growth of plants in thenext round, the nutrients lost must be replaced.
How can we replace the nutrients lost from the soil?  How can we increase the
crop producing potential of soils? The nutrients lost from the soil can be replaced orthe crop producing potential of soils can be increased by adding the appropriate fertilizersto the soil.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
154What are fertilizers?  Fertilizers are materials that are added to soils to increase the
growth, yield or nutrient value of crops. Fertilizers are usually classified as organic
(natural ) fertilizers and synthetic or artificial fertilizers.
Organic (natural) fertilizers  are those derived from animals and plants. This includes
animal dung, urine and substances obtained from the decay and decomposition ofplants. These fertilizers provide readily available nutrients to plants after some periodof decay and decomposition. These fertilizers can supply the elements nitrogen,phosphorus, potassium and various trace elements to the soil.
Synthetic or artificial fertilizers  contain all three major plant nutrients i.e., nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium, and are known as complete fertilizers .
A mixed artificial fertilizer may contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Such a
type of fertiliser is called a complete fertiliser. The term NPK is used to describefertilizers containing the elements nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
Examples of artificial fertilizers are ammonium sulphate, (NH
4)2SO4, potassium nitrate
(KNO3), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), and diammonium hydrogen phosphate, DAP
((NH4)2HPO4).
The most important mineral nutrients that need to be added to the soil are usually
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. All the three elements are needed in large quantities.
Commercial fertilizers are normally given a “grade”, which reflects the percentages
they contain of N, P and K by dry weight. For example, a NPK fertilizer may bedescribed as 10:10:10 indicating that there is 10% of each element in the fertilizer. Thesuitable proportions are best determined in relation to the tested fertility of the soil andthe requirements of the particular crop that is being grown on it. This means fertilizersof the same composition are not used for different purposes. In nitrogen deficient soil,a fertilizer containing a higher percentage of nitrogen than phosphorus and potassiummust be used. In addition to this, all fertilizers are not used for treatment of all kindsof soil. For example, ammonium sulphate is more suitable for use in basic soils than in
acidic or neutral soils.
Exercise 2.13
1.Classify the following as organic or synthetic fertilizers:
aNH4NO3burea c(NH4)2SO4
2.Can the same fertilizer be applied to all types of soil? Explain.
Pesticides
Pesticides are chemicals that can be applied to agricultural crops to kill pests which
affect the growth and development of plants. Parasitic fungi, insects and animals likerodents, rabbits and birds reduce crop yields or even completely destroy crops.
IMPORTANT INORGANIC COUMPOUNDS (UNIT 2)
155Pesticides are used to overcome the damage caused by fungi and pests. The majority
of the pesticides used in agriculture are organic compounds. However, there are someinorganic substances that serve as pesticides. These include fumigant insecticides thatexist in the vapour phase. Examples of fumigants are hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sulphurdioxide (SO
2), carbon disulphide (CS2) and phosphine (PH3). These pesticides are
mostly used in the treatment of empty transport containers, grain stores, warehouses,harvested products prior to or during storage and to destroy pests in the soil. Theother inorganic pesticides are mostly copper compounds such as CuCl
2, Cu(OH)2,
Cu(NO3)2, CuSO4, Cu2O and CuCO3. Among the inorganic compounds, CuSO4
and Cu2O are used as fungicides where as HCN, SO2, PH3, CuCl2, Cu(OH)2,
Cu(NO3)2 and CuCO3 are used as insecticides.
Herbicides
Herbicides are also called weed killers. They are used to control the damage causedby weeds. Inorganic compounds used as herbicides include ammonium sulphamate((NH
4)SO3–NH2), borax (Na2B4O7.10H2O), sodium chlorate (NaClO3) and ferrous
sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O).

1623.1  INTRODUCTION
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• explain electrochemistry;
Discuss  the following in groups and one of your group members will present your ideas
to the class.
Dry cells which we use in portable radios and flashlights are energy converters.a Peel the external cover of a dry cell battery and observe the components. How many
different components do you see? What are they?
b What type of energy do we get from dry cells? How does the cell generate this
energy?
Electrochemistry  is a field of chemistry that deals with the relationship between
electrical energy and chemical energy. It is a field of chemistry concerned with
processes that bring about chemical reactions ( changes ) using electricity or generating
electrical energy from chemical reactions. Thus, electrical energy and chemical energyare inter-convertible.
The devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy or electrical energy to
chemical energy are called electrochemical cells . These cells can be classified as
electrolytic cells  and galvanic  or voltaic cells . Electrolytic cells  use electrical energy to
bring about chemical changes that produce many desirable substances in our daily
lives. Galvanic or voltaic cells  convert chemical energy to electrical energy. The cells
we use in flashlight batteries, wrist watches, cameras and car batteries are examples
of Galvanic cells. The reactions between the chemicals in these cells are responsible
for the generation of electricity.
Electrochemistry has practical applications in our modern world and in everyday life.
Electrolysis is used to manufacture metals like sodium, aluminium; non-metals like
chlorine, hydrogen and compounds like sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite.Electrochemistry also has a role in the production of dry cells and lead storage
batteries used in the automotive industry.Activity 3.1

1633.2  ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
Competencies
After completing this subunit, you will be able to:
• define electrical conductivity;• explain metallic conductivity;
• explain electrolytic conductivity;
• distinguish between metallic and electrolytic conduction;• distinguish between weak and strong electrolytes;• use conductivity apparatus to test the conductivity of substances.
Why do metals conduct electricity? Do you know any non-metal, which conducts
electricity? Electrical conductivity  is the capacity of a substance to transmit electricity.
The materials that allow the passage of electricity through them are called electrical
conductors .
Conductivity apparatus is used to test the conductivity of different solid substances or
that of aqueous solutions of different compounds. The basic components of
conductivity apparatus include electric wires, electrodes, a d.c. source or dry cells, a
switch and light bulb. The components of the apparatus can be connected to one
another as shown in Figure 3.1.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
164Depending on the nature of the particles responsible for the flow of electric charges
through conductors, electrical conductivity can be classified as metallic conductivity or
electrolytic conductivity .
a)  Metallic conductivity

non-conductors.

you think some of the materials conduct electricity? (c) Does graphite have the same
nature as the other conductors of electricity?
Discuss in groups and present it to the class
Why do metals transmit electric current? What are the charge carriers in metals?
Metallic conductivity refers to the transmission of electric current through metals. This
transmission is directly related to the structure of metals. In atoms of metals, the
valence electrons are bounded very loosely to their respective nuclei and move very
easily throughout the metal. This means metals contain electrons that do not have fixed
positions and are relatively free to move. These electrons are called free electrons  or
mobile electrons  or delocalized electrons . Thus, the structure of the metals can be
regarded as a series of positively charged metal ions, or cations, in a sea of negatively
charged electrons.

Figure 3.2 Electrical conductivity in metals.Activity 3.2
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
165The electrons entering the metal displace (repel) the freely moving electrons at the
point of entry. The displaced electrons occupy new positions by pushing neighbouringelectrons ahead. This will continue until electrons are forced out of the wire at theopposite end. So, metallic conductivity is caused by the flow of mobile electrons dueto repulsion exerted on them from the electrons entering the metal from the source ofelectricity. The charge carriers in metallic conduction are electrons. Hence, metallicconductivity is also called electronic conductivity .
Non-metals  are generally non-conductors of electricity, because they do not have freely
moving electrons. Graphite is a form of carbon in which the carbon atoms are bonded in
trigonal planar fashion to the three other carbon atoms, to form inter-connected hexagonalrings, as shown in Figure3.3. Electrons move freely through the hexagonal layers, making
graphite a good conductor of electricity.
Figure 3.3 Structure of graphite (The blue colour is added to emphasize the planarity of the carbon layers.)
b)  Electrolytic conductivity
Electrolytes are substances that transmit electricity in a molten state or in aqueous
solution. Based on their degree of ionization or the extent to which they produceanions and cations, electrolytes can be classified as strong electrolytes or weak
electrolytes . Strong electrolytes ionize almost completely in aqueous solutions. Weak
electrolytes ionize only slightly. When electrical potential is applied through anelectrolyte solution, the positive ions ( cations ) move in one direction and the negative
ions ( anions ) move in the opposite direction. This movement of ions through the
electrolyte, brought about by the application of electricity, is called electrolyticconductivity. Hence, the charge-carriers in electrolytic conductivity are ions ( anions
and cations ).
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
166      Experiment 3.1Construct a conductivity apparatus in your group. To construct the apparatus,
you will need a light bulb, three dry cells, some electric wire, two graphite
electrodes and a switch. You can get the graphite electrodes by peeling off
two old dry cells. A graphite electrode is the long cylindrical black rod inside
the cell. Ask your teacher for further assistance. Assemble the materials as

2.Why do NaCl and CaCl2 conduct electricity when they are dissolved in water
or when they are in the molten form, but not in the solid state?
3.Why are solutions of strong electrolytes better conductors of electricity than
weak electrolytes?
The substances that do not transmit electricity either in solution or in a molten state are
called non-electrolytes . Ionic compounds are non-conductors of electricity in the solid
state. This is because their ions are held at fixed positions and cannot move. Otherexamples of non-electrolytes include sugar, ethanol, oil, benzene, and liquid nitrogen.

After completing this section, you will be able to:
• define the term electrolysis;

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
168• describe an electrolytic cell;
• draw and label a diagram of an electrolytic cell;

Give an opinion on the following questions and present your ideas to the class.
1.How do you identify whether an electrode is a cathode or an anode?
2.Can you suggest why positive and negative ions are named as cations and anions
respectively?
Electrolysis is a process in which electrical energy is used to produce chemical
changes. This process is carried out in an electrochemical cell known as an
electrolytic or electrolysis cell . A typical electrolysis cell contains a source of direct
electric current, an electrolyte and connecting wires that join the source to theelectrodes.
Electrodes are strips of metal or graphite that allow electrons to leave or enter the
electrolytes. They can be chemically active or inert. Active electrodes directly takepart in reactions. Examples include zinc and magnesium. Inert electrodes do not
directly take part in chemical reactions. They only serve to transfer electrons.
Examples include platinum  and graphite .
The electrode connected to the positive terminal of the source is positively charged
and is called the anode . It is the electrode through which electrons leave the cell. The
electrode connected to the negative terminal of the source is negatively charged and iscalled the  cathode . It is the electrode through which electrons enter the cell.
During electrolysis, the ions of the electrolyte migrate to the electrodes of the opposite
charge. The positive ions are attracted to the cathode and are called cations . Since
the cathode has excess electrons, the cations will discharge by gaining electrons. This
process of gaining electrons is called reduction .  The negative ions are attracted by the
positive electrode ( anode ) and are called anions . These ions are discharged by losing
electrons at the anode. This process of losing electrons is called oxidation .
Thus, the cathode is the electrode at which reduction occurs  and the anode  is the
electrode at which oxidation  takes place.Activity 3.3
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
169The reaction that takes place at each electrode is known as a half-cell  reaction . Oxidation
half-reactions  occur at the anode  and reduction half reaction  at the cathode . The net
reaction that takes place in the electrolytic cell is known as a  cell reaction . This overall
reaction is also referred to as an oxidation-reduction reaction  or redox reaction . So
electrolysis is a process in which electric energy is used to bring about an oxidation-
reduction reaction. It is also defined as the decomposition of an electrolyte, using electricity.The process of electrolysis includes electrolyzing aqueous solutions of electrolytes.
However, at this level, electrolysis of molten electrolytes will be discussed.
Electrolysis of Molten (Fused) Electrolytes
When ionic solids melt, they dissociates into positive and negative ions that are not
held in fixed positions. To understand the chemical reactions that occur during
electrolysis, consider a hypothetical electrolyte, MX, that dissociate into M
+ and X–.
MXmelting→M+  + X–
During electrolysis, the cations, M+ ions, move toward the cathode, gain one electron
each and become M atoms. The anions, X– ions, move toward the anode, lose one
electron and become X  atoms. The reaction at each electrode and the entire reaction
in the electrolytic cell are represented by the following equations.
Cathode reaction: M+ + 1e– Æ M (Reduction-half reaction )
Anode reac tion: X–Æ X + 1e– (Oxidation half-reaction )
Cell reaction: M+ + X– electrolysis→M + X ( Oxidation-reduction )
Figure 3.5  Electrolysis of fused Electrolyte, MX.
Here, it is very important to realize that the number of electrons gained by the cations
at the cathode is exactly equal to the number of electrons lost by anions at the anode
during electrolysis. This is true for any oxidation-reduction ( redox ) reaction.
Moreover, oxidation and reduction reactions proceed simultaneously. Reduction and
oxidation cannot occur separately. Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction and
there cannot be reduction in the absence of oxidation, and vice versa.

3.4  GALVANIC (VOL TAIC) CELLS
Competencies
After completing this section, you will be able to:
• construct a simple galvanic cell, using strips of zinc, copper, ZnSO4 and CuSO4
solutions;
• mention different types of voltaic cells;
• describe how voltaic cells can be used to make commercially useful batteries;• distinguish between voltaic cell and an electrolytic cell;• describe voltaic cells.
Discuss the following and present your ideas to the class:
1.Have you seen the expiry date written on dry cells? Can we get the expected amount
of electric energy after the expiry date of the cell; why?
2.Do we throw away car batteries when they fail to generate electricity? Explain.
3.Galvanic cells available in the market have positive and negative terminals. Does this
show that they also possess an anode and cathode?
In the previous section, electrolytic cells were defined as electrochemical cells in which
electricity was used to bring about chemical reactions. The chemical reaction in anelectrolytic cell is caused by electricity and is a non-spontaneous redox reaction. This
means the reaction can proceed only in the presence of electricity. If we stop passingelectricity through the electrolyte, the reaction will stop.
In a Galvanic cell, the reaction that occurs inside the cell is a spontaneous redox
reaction . The reaction that occurs inside the cell will proceed on its own without anyActivity 3.4
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
172external influence. This reaction enables a galvanic cell to generate electricity.
Therefore, Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox
reactions generate electricity. They convert chemical energy into electrical energy.
Galvanic or voltaic cells are classified into primary cells, secondary cells, and fuel
cells. For this level, only primary and secondary cells will be discussed.
Primary Cells
Primary galvanic cells are those cells that are not rechargeable. This is because the
electrode reaction as well as the entire cell reaction cannot be reversed on recharging.Once the chemicals in the cells that serve as reactants are completely used up, it is
not possible to recover them by charging the cells. Examples of primary cells include
Daniel’s cell and zinc-carbon ( Leclanche ) dry cells. The common feature of all
Galvanic cells is that they contain two electrodes in contact with an electrolyte. The
electrolyte in a Galvanic cell can be in the form of a solution or a paste. The cells
containing electrolytes in the form of solution are called wet cells , and those containing
electrolytes in the form of paste are called dry cells .
An example of a wet primary cell is the Daniell cell . It consists of a zinc strip placed
in ZnSO
4 solution in one compartment and a copper strip placed in copper sulphate,
CuSO4, solution in another compartment. Each compartment is called a half-cell , and
the reactions occurring in each compartment are called half-cell  reactions . The
solutions in the two compartments are linked by a salt bridge as shown in Figure 3.7 .
The salt bridge consists of  a delivery tube filled with warm mixture of conc. KCl
solution and agar solution, which is then allowed to cool so that it sets in the form of
a gel.
Alternately, a porous barrier is used to separate the solutions. The zinc atoms from the
zinc electrode lose two electrons each and become zinc ions, Zn2+. The ions enter
into the solution, and the electrons remain on the electrode and flow through theexternal wire to the copper electrode. This situation causes the zinc electrode to be
negative and the solution to have an overall positive charge.
On the other hand, in the compartment containing the copper electrode, copper ions,
Cu
2+, from the solution move to the cathode and gain two electrons each, to become
copper atoms and deposit on the surface of the copper electrode. This condition
causes the electrode to be positive and the solution to have a negative charge.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
173Figure 3.7  The Daniell Cell.
Note that the anode is the negative electrode and the cathode is the positive electrode
in galvanic cells, as opposed to the situation in an electrolytic cell. But, it is always
oxidation that occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode.
The half-cell reactions and the cell reaction in Daniell cells  are represented as
Anode reaction:  Zn (s)  Æ  Zn2+ (aq) + 2e–
Cathode reaction:  Cu2+ (aq) + 2e–  Æ  Cu (s)
Cell reaction:  Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq)  Æ  Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s)
Due to the oxidation-reduction reaction in the cell, the Daniell cell  generates electricity.
What is the purpose of the salt bridge in Figure 3.7 ?
From the preceding discussion, it is clear that the solution in which the zinc electrode
is placed has an overall positive charge while the solution in the copper compartment
has a negative charge. Unless the two solutions are neutral, the cell cannot produce
electricity. Thus, the purpose of the salt bridge is to:
amaintain electrical neutrality between the two solutions. In this process the anions
(negative ions ) from the salt bridge diffuse into the solution containing the zinc
electrodes, and the cations ( positive ions ) diffuse into the solution containing
the copper electrode to compensate for the excess positive and negative charges,
respectively;Cu + 2e Cu

174ballow electrical contact between the two solutions;
cprevent mixing of the electrode solutions.
Although, wet cells like the Daniell cell  can serve as a source of electricity, they are
not portable since they contain solutions. Due to this practical problem of using wetcells, dry cells were developed.
In a dry cell, a moist electrolyte paste is used instead of solutions. This cell was
invented by Georges Leclanche , a French chemist.
A zinc-carbon dry cell, which is also called a Leclanche cell  (Figure 3.8 ) is used in
devices like portable radios and flashlights. The cell consists of a zinc cup that servesas the anode. The zinc cup is filled with a paste of manganese (IV) oxide, zincchloride, ammonium chloride and powdered carbon. A graphite rod, immersed in thispaste, serves as the cathode.
Figure 3.8   Zinc-carbon dry cell (Leclanche cell).
A zinc-carbon dry cell produces electricity as a result of a spontaneous redoxreaction. Oxidation occurs at the zinc cup.

A build up of ammonia gas around the cathode may disrupt the current. However, this
is prevented by the reaction between Zn2+ and NH3 to form a complex ion,
[Zn(NH3)2]2+ which crystallizes as a chloride salt.

There are other examples of dry cells, such as the alkaline dry cell, silver oxide cell,
and copper oxide cell.

the polarity of the electrodes in Galvanic cells similar to that of the electrodesin electrolytic cells?
3.Why do we refer to the redox reactions in electrolytic and voltaic cells as non-
spontaneous and spontaneous, respectively?

Write a laboratory report and submit to your teacher.
Secondary Cells
Unlike primary cells, secondary cells are rechargeable. The electrode reactions can be
reversed, and the original reactants can be regenerated. This can be achieved by passinga direct current through the cell. The process is called charging  or recharging .
A secondary cell needs to be recharged when it stops producing electricity. A lead
storage battery is an example of a secondary cell.
A lead Storage Battery  is the common automobile battery that usually delivers either 6
or 12 volts, depending on the number of cells used in its construction. The inside ofthe battery consists of galvanic cells connected in series. A fully-charged lead-acid cellis made up of a stack of alternating lead and lead (IV) oxide plates isolated from eachother by porous separators. The individual cells contain a number of lead anodesconnected together, plus a number of cathodes composed of PbO
2, also joined
together. These electrodes are immersed in 35% sulphuric acid, which serves as anelectrolyte.
A single lead-storage cell delivers 2 volts. Therefore, a 12 V battery contains six cells
connected in series.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
177Figure 3.9   Lead - Storage Battery.
When a lead-storage battery is in operation ( on discharge ), the following reactions
occur at the electrodes:
Anode reactions:   Pb (s) + SO2–
4  (aq)  Æ  PbSO4 (s) + 2e–
Cathode reactions:  PbO2 (s) + 4H+ (aq) + SO2–
4  (aq) + 2e– Æ PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l)
and the overall reaction is:
Pb (s) + PbO2 (s) + 4H+ (aq) 2SO2–
4  (aq) Æ 2PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l)
From the electrode reactions it can be noticed that PbSO4 is produced at both
electrodes.
Unlike primary cells a lead-storage battery is rechargeable when the battery runs
down. The electrode reactions can be reversed by placing a potential across theelectrodes that is slightly larger than that which the battery can deliver. The reactionthat takes place on recharging a lead storage battery is given by the followingequation.

3.5  INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF ELECTROL YSIS
Competencies
After completing this section, you will be able to:
• describe selected industrial applications of electrolysis;
1.The copper used for the transmission of electric current is supposed to be 100% pure.
What happens if the copper is impure?
2.How many articles in your house are electroplated? Make a list. What is the purpose of
electroplating?
Discuss in groups and share your opinions with your classmates.
Each day, our lives are touched directly or indirectly by the products of electrolysis.
Electrolysis has important industrial applications. It is used for:
a)The production of chemicals like sodium hydroxide, from
electrolysis of brine (concentrated NaCl solution ), using
inert electrodes.
The reactions that take place at the electrodes ( when graphite electrodes are used )
are as follows:
Anode reaction:  2Cl– (aq)  Æ  Cl2 (g) + 2e–
Cathode reaction:  2H2O (l) + 2e– Æ H2 (g) + 2OH– (aq)
The overall cell reaction is:
2NaCl (aq) + 2H2O (l) Æ 2Na+ (aq) + 2OH– (aq) + Cl2 (g) + H2 (g)Activity 3.6
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
179b)  For the production of metals and non-metals.
The non-metals like H2, Cl2, F2 etc are manufactured on an industrial scale by the
process called electrolysis. The metal aluminium is extracted industrially by the Hall
Process . This process involves the electrolysis of molten alumina (Al2O3) mixed with
some amount of cryolite, Na3AlF6. The role of cryolite is to reduce the melting point
of alumina from 2000°C to 1000°C. The vessel holding the molten mixture(Figure 3.8 ) is made up of iron lined with carbon, which serves as the cathode.
Carbon ( graphite ) rods that serve as the anode are inserted into the melt. When the
molten mixture is electrolyzed, pure aluminium is produced. The reactions at theelectrodes are:
Anode reaction:
()2– –
2   6O l  3O  (g)  +  12e →
Cathode reaction:  ()3+ –4Al l  + 12e   4Al(l) →
Overall reaction:  3+ 2–
2 4Al (l)  +  6O (l)    3O (g)  +  4Al(l) →
Figure 3.10   Production of Aluminium by Hall Process.
c)  For the Purification of Metals.
Activity 3.7
For electrolytic and voltaic cells, the cell reaction is the sum of anode and cathode half-
reactions. For electrolytic cell used to purify copper, there is no net (overall) reaction.
aExplain why this is so.
bDoes this process mean wastage of time, labour and energy? Why? Discuss in groups
and present your opinion o the rest of the class.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
180Another important application of electrolysis is the purification of metals like copper.
When first separated from its ore, copper metal is about 99% pure with nickel, silver,gold and platinum as major impurities. In the refining process, the impure copper isused as the anode, copper metal of high purity used as cathode, and copper sulphate,CuSO
4 solution and aqueous H2SO4 as the electrolyte.
When electrolysis is carried out, copper and impurities that are more easily oxidized
than copper, such as nickel, will go into the solution. Copper passes through thesolution and deposits on the cathode, while the impurities remain in solution. Impuritieslike silver and gold are less easily oxidized and do not dissolve but fall away from the
anode as ‘sludge’ . The electrode reaction in the purification of copper is the following:
Anode reaction:
2Cu (s) Cu (aq) 2e+−→+
Cathode reaction:  2Cu (aq) 2e Cu (s)+−+→
During the process, the size of the impure copper anode decreases and that of the
pure copper cathode increases.
Figure 3.11   Purification of Copper by Electrolysis.
Always remember that, in the purification of metals by electrolysis, the impure metal
should be used as the anode , the pure form  of the metal as the cathode  and an
electrolyte should contain soluble salt ( ions) of the metal to be purified. The process
of purifying metals by electrolysis is called electrorefining .
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 3)
181d) Electroplating
Activity 3.8
When zinc electrode is dipped in copper sulphate solution, part of the electrode in the
solution will be covered with  a reddish brown layer of copper. Can this process be
considered as electroplating? Explain. Discuss in groups and present your opinion to the
class.
What is the purpose of electroplating?
Electroplating is a process of covering the surface of a metal ( metal article ) with a
thin layer of another metal. Using this process, metals that easily corrode can beprotected by a thin coating of another metal that resists corrosion. For example, tincans are steel cans with a thin coating of tin, and chrome-plated bumpers are used forautomobiles. Thus, the main objective of electroplating is to protect an article from
corrosion  and to give articles a beautiful appearance . In the process of electroplating,
the pure plating metal should be used as the anode, the article ( metal ) to be plated
the as cathode and a solution containing ions of the plating metal as the electrolyte.
For example, to produce a silver-plated copper article, say, a medal, one shoulduse s ilver as the anode, the copper medal as the cathode and silver nitrate solution as
the electrolyte ( Figure 3.12 ).

4.3.1  Production of Some Important Metals
A.  Aluminium
Occurrence and extraction
Aluminium is the most abundant metal and the third most plentiful element after oxygen and
silicon in the earth’s crust. About seven percent of the earth’s crust is aluminium. It is thesecond-most important metal, after iron, in terms of consumption. Aluminium does notoccur as a free metal in nature. Its principal ore is bauxite (Al
2O3.2H2O). Other minerals
containing aluminium are orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), cryolite (Na3AlF6), corundum (Al2O3),
beryl (Be3Al2Si6O8) and china clay (Al2Si2O7.2H2O).
Aluminium is extracted industrially principally, from bauxite, Al2O3•2H2O, by the Hall–
Héroult process  or simply the Hall process . In this process, first the bauxite needs to be
purified since it is frequently contaminated with silica (SiO2), iron oxides and titanium (IV)
oxide. To isolate pure Al2O3 from bauxite, the powdered ore is first heated with sodium
hydroxide solution to convert silica into a soluble silicate.
SiO2 (s) + 2NaOH (aq) Æ Na2SiO3 (aq) + H2O (l)
At the same time aluminium oxide is converted to soluble sodium aluminate.
Al2O3 (s) + 2NaOH (aq) Æ NaAlO2 (aq) + H2O (l)
The impurities like iron oxides and titanium (IV) oxide remain unaffected by the base and
are filtered off. Why are they not affected?
Then the solution is treated with acid to precipitate aluminium hydroxide.
AlO2–  (aq) + H3O+ (aq) Æ Al(OH)3 (s)
Aluminium hydroxide is collected by filtration, washed, dried, and then heated strongly in
a furnace to get Al2O3.
2Al(OH)3    heat→ Al2O3    +    3H2O
Pure aluminium oxide is mixed with some cryolite, Na3AlF6, and then melted. Cryolite is
added to Al2O3 to reduce its melting point from 2045oC to 1000oC. The molten mixture is
then electrolyzed to obtain aluminium. The electrolytic cell, in which the molten mass iselectrolyzed, contains graphite electrodes as both anode and cathode.

Al2O3 is converted to Al, by electrolysis.  We do not use reducing agents for reduction
of aluminium from aluminium oxide; why?
Physical Properties:  Aluminium is a soft silvery-white metal having a density of 2.7
g/cm3. It melts at 660°C.. It can be shaped into wires, rolled, pressed or cast into different
shapes. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity.
Chemical Properties:  Aluminium is a reactive metal, even though its reactions are not
vigorous in comparison with those of sodium, potassium, calcium and other metals ofgroup IA and IIA. It undergoes the following reactions:
a Reaction with Oxygen:
Aluminium has affinity for oxygen and reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin
film of aluminium oxide on its surface.
4Al (s) + 3O
2 (g) Æ 2Al2O3 (s)Activity 4.4
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
194This thin film of oxide inhibits further reaction with oxygen. The thin film can be
removed by rubbing with mercury or mercury (II) chloride solution.
What type of oxide is  Al2O3?
b Reaction with dilute acids:
Aluminium reacts with dilute acids like HCl and H2SO4, forming salts and liberating
hydrogen gas.
2Al (s) + 3H2SO4 (aq) Æ Al2(SO4)3 (aq) + 3H2 (g)
2Al (s) + 6HCl (aq) Æ 2AlCl3 (s) + 3H2 (g)
Aluminium does not react with dilute or concentrated HNO3 due to the formation of
a protective oxide layer on its surface.
c Aluminium burns in chlorine gas to form aluminium chloride:
2Al (s) + 3Cl2 (g) Æ 2AlCl3 (s)
d Aluminium reacts with sodium hydroxide solution:
2Al (s) + 2NaOH (aq) + 6H2O (l)Æ2NaAl(OH)4 (aq) + 3H2 (g)
Uses:  Aluminium is lightweight and corrosion resistant, so it is used to make light alloys
like duralumin ( mixture of Al, Cu and Mg). Alloys of aluminium are extensively used in the
transport industry to make aircraft, ships and cars. It is used in the manufacture of householdcooking utensils due to its high thermal conductivity and resistance to corrosion. It is alsoused to make door and window frames and roofing for buildings, as packaging material infood industries, and for electrical transmission lines.
In the  thermite welding process, powdered aluminium when mixed with iron (III) oxide
and ignited, produces a temperature of about 3000°C. This temperature is quite sufficientfor welding metals. The reaction in this process is as follows:
2Al (s) + Fe
2O3 (s) Æ 2Fe (l) + Al2O3 (s)
The mixture of powdered aluminium and iron oxide is called thermite.

B.  Iron
Occurrence and Extraction
Iron is the second-most abundant metal next to aluminium, in the earth’s crust and it is the
fourth most abundant element.  It constitutes about 4.7% of the earth’s crust by weight. Itis never found as a free metal in nature. It occurs in nature only in the form of compounds,such as oxides, carbonates and sulphides. The chief ores of iron are hematite (Fe
2O3),
limonite (Fe2O3.H2O), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). It is also found in the
form of iron pyrites (FeS2) which is commonly called fool’s gold .
Iron is generally extracted from hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4) and siderite (FeCO3).
The extraction of iron from its ores is carried out in a blast furnace . The raw materials for
the extraction of iron are iron ore, coke, limestone and hot air. The furnace is charged witha mixture of iron ore, limestone and coke at the top and a blast of hot air is blown in at thebottom. The coke burns to form carbon dioxide and the temperature approaches 2000°Cnear the bottom. As the carbon dioxide rises up, the coke reduces it to carbon monoxide.The carbon monoxide then reduces the iron oxide to iron metal. The overall reactions inthe blast furnace can be summarized as follows:
1.Oxidation of coke to carbon dioxide:
C (s) + O
2 (g) Æ CO2 (g) + heat
2.Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide:
CO2 (g) + C (s) Æ 2CO (g)
3.Reduction of iron oxides to metallic iron by carbon monoxide:
3Fe2O3 (s) + CO (g) Æ 2Fe3O4 (s) + CO2 (g)
Fe3O4 (s) + CO (g) Æ 3FeO (s) + CO2 (g)
FeO (s) + CO (g) Æ Fe (l) + CO2 (g)

5.Reaction of calcium oxide with impurities like silica (SiO2) to form calcium silicate
which is a glass-like material called slag.
CaO + SiO2Æ CaSiO3
The molten iron flows to the bottom of the blast furnace. The slag is less dense and floats
on the surface of the molten iron. Thus, the molten iron and the molten slag are tapped offseparately. The slag is used mostly for the manufacture of cement
Figure 4.2   Blast furnace.
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
197The iron obtained directly from the blast furnace is called pig iron . It is impure and contains
about 2% silicon, up to 1% phosphorus and manganese, and traces of sulphur. Theseimpurities make pig iron brittle. When pig iron is re-melted with scrap iron and cast intomoulds, it forms cast iron .
Wrought iron:  is the purest form of commercial iron. It is obtained by removing most of
the impurities from pig iron. It is manufactured by heating impure iron with hematite andlimestone in a furnace.  This increases the purity of the iron to 99.5%.  Wrought iron is atough, malleable and ductile form of iron.
PROJECT 4.1
Form a group and construct a model of the blast furnace from locally availablematerials.
Conversion of Pig Iron to Steel
The relatively high carbon-content of the iron recovered from the blast furnace ( pig iron )
makes it very hard and brittle. The conversion of pig iron to steel is essentially a purificationprocess in which impurities are removed by oxidation. This purification process is carriedout in a furnace at high temperatures. In the conversion of pig iron to steel, three differentmethods are used.  These are the Bessemer Converter, Open-hearth Furnace and the
Basic Oxygen Process .
a The Bessemer Converter:  In the process of converting pig iron to steel, molten
pig iron from the blast furnace is transferred to a cylindrical vessel containing arefractory lining of MgCO
3 and CaCO3. A blast of hot air is blown through the
molten metal from a set of small holes at the bottom of the vessel. The oxygenpassing through the molten metal converts silicon, phosphorus and sulphur to theiroxides, which then react with the lining to form a slag. The carbon in the pig iron isalso oxidized to carbon monoxide, so its concentration is also reduced. Theconversion of the pig iron to steel by this process requires only 15 minutes. However,the reaction is difficult to control and the quality of the steel produced can be quitevariable.
b The Open-hearth Furnace:  It has a large, shallow hearth, which is usually lined
with a basic oxide refractory (MgO and CaO). The furnace is charged with a mixtureof pig iron, Fe
2O3, scrap iron and limestone. A blast of hot air and burning fuel is
directed over the surface of the charge to maintain it in the molten state. Impurities inthe pig iron are oxidized by the Fe
2O3 and air. Carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide
formed by the oxidation of the carbon and sulphur, respectively, in the pig ironbubble out of the mixture as waste gases.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
198The SiO2 and other acidic oxides like P4O10 combine with CaO ( from limestone ) and the
refractory lining to form a slag.
The impurities in pig iron are oxidized in the following way:
C+ O2Æ CO2
S+ O2Æ SO2
12P + 10Fe2O3Æ 3P4O10+ 20Fe
3Si + 2Fe2O3Æ 3SiO2+ 4Fe
Calcium oxide, formed by the decomposition of limestone, reacts with oxides of silicon
and phosphorus to form slag.
P4O10+ 6CaO Æ 2Ca3(PO4)2
SiO2+ CaO Æ CaSiO3
This entire process takes 8 to 10 hours to complete and the quality of the steel is much
more easily controlled. A calculated amount of various elements can be added to the steelto form steel alloys with desired properties.

CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
199c Basic Oxygen Process:  This newer procedure has largely replaced the open
hearth, because of its high speed. It involves forcing a mixture of powderedcalcium oxide, CaO, and oxygen gas directly into the surface of the moltenpig iron. The oxygen reacts exothermically with carbon, sulphur, silicon,phosphorus and impurity metals. Carbon and sulphur are oxidized to CO
2 and
SO2, respectively, and are released as exhaust gases. The oxides of silicon
(SiO2), phosphorus, (P4O10) and impurity metals combine with lime (CaO),
forming slag. The charge in the converter is maintained in the molten state bythe energy released in these oxidation reactions. The converter is tilted toremove the slag. After a second blow of oxygen, the converter is tilted onceagain and the molten steel is poured out.  This process takes only about 20
to 25 minutes.

200Physical Properties of Iron
Do you remember physical properties of iron? Can you mention some of them?
Iron is a grey, lustrous, malleable and ductile metal. It is a good conductor of heat and
electricity. It has a high melting point (1580°C) and a high density (7.87 g/cm3). It is a
ferromagnetic metal, which means it can be permanently magnetized.
Chemical Properties of Iron
Have you ever noticed the formation of a reddish thin film on the surface of aniron object? Do you know the chemical nature of this thin film? From yourobservations, what do you conclude about the reactivity of iron?
Iron is a reactive metal. Its reactivity is very slow, compared to group IA and IIA metals.Iron rusts in the presence of air and moisture to form hydrated iron (III) oxide.
4Fe (s) + 3O
2 (g)moisture→ 2Fe2O3 .x H2O(s) (rust)
Iron reacts with dilute acids, like HCl and H2SO4, forming iron (II) salts and liberating
hydrogen gas.
Fe (s) + 2HCl (aq) Æ FeCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)
Fe (s) + H2SO4 (aq) Æ FeSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)
Like other transition metals, iron also exhibits different oxidation states. It commonly exists
as the ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe+3) ions.  Iron (II) and iron (III) compounds are coloured.
Aqueous solutions of iron (II) compounds are pale-green and solutions of iron (III)compounds are yellowish brown.
Aqueous solutions of some iron (II) compounds are rapidly oxidized to the corresponding
iron (III) compounds. For example, iron (II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)
2, on exposure to air,
oxidizes to iron (III) hydroxide.

201Iron has the ability to displace less active metals from solutions of their salts. For example,
when a piece of iron is placed in a solution of CuSO4, it is oxidized to Fe2+ and a reddish
brown deposit of copper metal forms on the surface of the iron.

Uses of Iron
Iron is the most widely used metal and takes first position in worldwide consumption. It is
used as a structural metal in the construction of buildings and bridges. In the form of pigiron, it is used to make domestic boilers, hot-water radiators, railings, water pipes, castings,and mouldings. As wrought iron, it is used in making nails, sheets, horseshoes, ornamentalgates, door knockers, farm machinery etc. Iron is also used in the manufacture of alloyssuch as carbon steels and alloy steels. Carbon steels can be classified as mild steel, mediumsteel and high-carbon steel, based on the amount of carbon.
Mild Steel:  contains up to 0.2% carbon and is used in making screws, motors, car batteries,
railway lines, ships, bridges, nuts and bolts.
Medium Steel:  contains 0.3–0.6% carbon and is used to make springs and chains.
High-Carbon Steel:  contains 0.6–1.5% carbon and is used to make drill bits, knives,
hammers and chisels.
Alloy Steel:  contains iron and a relatively higher percentage of other metals. For example,
stainless steel contains chromium (14–18%) and nickel (7–9%). Tool steels include tungstensteel and manganese steel. These metals give the alloy hardness, toughness and heatresistance. They are used in rock drills, cutting edges and parts of machinery that aresubjected to heavy wear.

202C.  Copper
Occurrence and extraction
Copper  is occasionally found as native copper. However, it is found mainly in compounds
such as sulphides, oxides and the carbonates. The most important sulphide ores are
chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS) and bornite (Cu5FeS4). The
principal oxide ores are cuprite (Cu2O) and tenorite (CuO). In the carbonate form, it
exists as malachite (CuCO3.Cu(OH)2).
Copper is principally extracted from chalcopyrite. Since the amount of copper in the ore is
very small, the crushed and ground sulphide ore is first concentrated by froth flotation. Thistreatment changes the concentration of the ore from 2 % copper to as high as 30% copper.The concentrated ore is then roasted with a limited supply of air ( oxygen ).
2CuFeS
2 (s) + 4O2 (g) Æ Cu2S (s) + 2FeO (s) + 3SO2 (g)
The roasted mixture is smelted by adding limestone and sand to form a molten slag that
removes many of the impurities. FeO present in the roasted mixture can also be removedas slag in the form of iron silicate (FeSiO
3), and silica in the form of calcium silicate (CaSiO3).
CaCO3 (s) + SiO2 (s)Æ     CaSiO3 (l) + CO2 (g)

The Cu2S obtained by roasting chalcopyrite is then reduced by heating it in a limited supply
of oxygen.
Cu2S (s) + O2 (g) Æ 2Cu (l) + SO2 (g)
The copper produced by the above process is called blister copper  and it has 98.5 – 99.5
% purity. Blister copper contains iron, silver, gold and sometimes zinc as impurities. So it isrefined further by electrolysis as shown in Figure 4.5 . Copper obtained by electrolytic
refining is 99.99% pure.

203Physical Properties of Copper
Copper is a soft, ductile, malleable, reddish-brown metal with a density of 8.96 g/cm3. It
is second to silver in electrical conductivity. It melts at 1086°C and boils at 2310°C.
Chemical properties of copper
Copper is less reactive metal, that is why it is found in the native state. Although it is notvery reactive, it undergoes the following reactions:
Powdered copper, when heated in air forms a black powder of copper (II) oxide, CuO.
2Cu (s)    +    O
2 (g)    Æ    2CuO (s)
Copper does not react with dilute acids like HCl and H2SO4. It cannot displace hydrogen
from acids. However, it can be oxidized by oxidizing acids such as dilute and concentratednitric acid and hot concentrated sulphuric acid, H
2SO4.

Copper corrodes in moist air over a long period of time as a result of oxidation caused by
a mixture of water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. It turns green, due to the formation ofverdigris:  a basic copper carbonate (CuCO
3.Cu(OH)2) or Cu2(OH)2CO3.
2Cu (s)    +    H2O (l)    +    O2 (g)    +    CO2 (g)    Æ    CuCO3.Cu(OH)2
Basic copper carbonate is responsible for the green layer that forms on the surface of
copper and bronze objects. This layer adheres to the surface and protects the metal fromfurther corrosion.
Copper is a transition metal and exhibits different oxidation states. It exists as cuprous
(Cu
+) and cupric (Cu2+) ions. Compounds containing copper in the +1 oxidation state are
stable in insoluble compounds. Cu1+ is unstable and cannot exist in aqueous solution since
it reduces and oxidizes ( disproportionates ) itself as follows:
2Cu+ (aq)    Æ    Cu2+ (aq)    +    Cu (s)
Soluble compounds containing Cu+, such as CuCl, CuI and CuBr, are all colourless solids.
The most stable oxidation state of copper is +2.  Aqueous solutions of many copper (II)compounds are blue, thus copper forms coloured compounds in the oxidation state of +2.For example, hydrated copper sulphate, CuSO
4.5H2O, consists of blue crystals, and its
aqueous solution is also blue.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
204Uses of Copper
Copper is used to manufacture alloys. For example, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin,
and it is used to make coins, medals, bells, machinery parts, etc. Brass is an alloy ofcopper and zinc, and it is used for hardware tops, terminals and pipes. Copper is widelyused in the electrical industry in the form of electric wires, cables etc. Copper compounds,such as copper chloride, copper carbonate and copper hydroxide, are used as pesticides.

Discuss in group and give a presentation to the class.4.3.2  Production of Some Important Non-metals
A.  Nitrogen
Occurrence and Production
Nitrogen occurs in nature in the elemental form.  It also exists in the form of compounds. In
the elemental state, it exists as a diatomic molecule, N2, in atmospheric air. It constitutes
about 80% by volume of the atmosphere. In the form of compounds, it exists as sodiumnitrate ( Chile salt peter , NaNO
3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) also called saltpetre . It is
also found in DNA molecules and proteins of all living things.
In the industrial production of nitrogen, the first step is to remove impurities like dust and
other particles from air. The air is then compressed under high pressure and low temperatureto remove carbon dioxide and water vapour since they solidify at a relatively high
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
205temperatures compared to nitrogen and oxygen. As the temperature continues to decrease,
the air containing mainly nitrogen and oxygen condenses to give a pale-blue liquid. Nitrogenis thus separated on an industrial scale by  fractional distillation of liquid air . When liquid air
is fractionally distilled, nitrogen is collected and stored in steel cylinders under pressure.The second fraction consists of argon, which distils off the mixture at –186°C, leavingbehind a blue liquid of oxygen that boils at –183°C.
In the laboratory, nitrogen is prepared by warming an aqueous solution containing ammonium
chloride and sodium nitrite.
NH
4Cl (aq)    +    NaNO2 (aq)    Æ    NaCl (aq)    +    N2 (g)    +    2H2O (l)
Physical Properties of Nitrogen
Nitrogen is colourless, odourless and tasteless gas. It is inert under ordinary conditions, and
that is why it is found in atmospheric air as N2. The inertness of nitrogen at low temperatures
is directly related to the strength of the triple bond, which requires high energy to break.
Chemical Properties of Nitrogen
Is nitrogen a reactive or unreactive non-metal? Can you suggest a proof for your
answer?
However, nitrogen reacts with metals of group IA and IIA as well as oxygen at higher
temperatures. When heated with reactive metals like lithium, calcium and magnesium, itforms compounds, known as nitrides .

2 (g) Æ 2Li3N (s)
3Ca (s) + N2 (g) Æ Ca3N2 (s)

Nitrogen combines with oxygen at elevated temperatures or in an electric arc to form
oxides.
N2 (g) + O2 (g) Æ 2NO (g)
N2  (g) + 2O2 (g) Æ 2NO2 (g)
Nitric oxide, also called nitrogen monoxide, NO, is a colourless and reactive gas. It forms
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a reddish brown gas, when it comes into contact with oxygen.
2NO (g) + O2 (g) Æ 2NO2 (g)
This reddish brown gas dimerizes at low temperatures to give a colourless gas of dinitrogen
tetraoxide, N2O4.
2NO2 (g) Æ N2O4 (g)
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
206Nitrogen also forms oxides, like dinitrogen monoxide, N2O, (commonly called laughing
gas), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5).
Nitrogen reacts directly with hydrogen in the Haber process  to form ammonia. In this
process, a mixture of N2 and H2 gas, at a pressure of 200-300 atm and a temperature of
400-600°C, is passed over a catalyst of finely divided iron.

The ammonia produced by this method is primarily used in the manufacture of fertilizers. It
is also used for the production of nitric acid (HNO3).
Uses of Nitrogen
Nitrogen is used in food packaging to prevent oxidation, and to create an inert atmospherein the production of semiconductors. Liquid nitrogen is used as a refrigerant to preservebulls’ semen and blood. Its major use is in the production of ammonia.
Have you ever observed glowing worms? Why do they glow? Anyone who has observed
them should explain to the class.
B.  Phosphorus
Occurrence and Extraction
Does phosphorus exist in the pure form (elemental state) as does nitrogen?  If not,
why?  Phosphorus is a relatively abundant element, ranking 12th in the earth’s crust. It
exists naturally only in the combined state, such as in rock phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2,
fluoroapatite, Ca10(PO4)6F2  or  3Ca3 (PO4)2.CaF2. It is also found in teeth, bones and
DNA.
What is allotropy? What are the two common allotropes of phosphorus?Allotropes  are different forms of the same element with the same physical state but with
different physical properties. This is due to the difference in the arrangement of atoms.
The two common allotropic forms of phosphorus are white phosphorus  and red phosphorus .
White phosphorus is a very poisonous, white waxy-looking substance that melts at 44.1°Cand boils at 287°C.  Its density is 1.8 g/cm
3. It consists of individual tetra-atomic (P4)
molecules and is an unstable form of phosphorus.Activity 4.9
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
207Red phosphorus is denser (2.16 g/cm3) and is much less reactive than white phosphorus at
normal temperatures. It consists of P4 molecules linked together to form a polymer ( large
molecule ) as shown below.
Industrially, white phosphorus is manufactured by heating a mixture of crushed rock
phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2, silica, SiO2, and coke in an electric furnace. The reaction in the
furnace is:
2Ca3(PO4)2 (s)   +   6SiO2 (s)   +   10C (s)   Æ   6CaSiO3 (l)   +   P4 (g)   +   10CO (g)
The vaporized phosphorus (P4) is condensed, collected and stored under water. Red
phosphorus is prepared by heating white phosphorus in sunlight for several days. Whitephosphorus is stored under water because it spontaneously ignites (bursts into flames) inthe presence of oxygen. Red phosphorus is much less reactive than white phosphorus anddoes not need to be stored under water.
Physical Properties of Phosphorus
Use reference books available in your school library and write down the main properties
of white and red phosphorus.
Chemical Properties of Phosphorus
Phosphorus exhibits the following common  chemical reactions. Phosphorus reacts with
limited and excess supplies of oxygen to form tetraphosphorus hexoxide (P4O6) and
tetraphosphorus decoxide (P4O10) respectively.
P4 (s) + 3O2  (g) Æ P4O6 (s)
P4 (s) + 5O2 (g) Æ P4O10 (s)

C.  Oxygen
Occurrence and Production
Oxygen is the most abundant element on earth. It constitutes about 46.6% by weight of the
earth’s crust in the form of compounds such as oxides, silicates, carbonates, phosphatesetc. It exists in nature in the elemental state in atmospheric air constituting about 20% byvolume.  Oxygen is manufactured industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air in away similar to that of nitrogen.
Chemical Properties of Oxygen
Oxygen is relatively reactive and combines directly with most elements to form oxides.Oxygen combines with metal to form metal oxides ( basic oxides ). For example,

Have you observed the colour of sulphur? What is the use of sulphur   in your area?
D.  Sulphur
Occurrence and Extraction
Sulphur is found in nature and in the form of compounds such as galena (PbS), pyrites
(FeS2) (fool’ s gold  ), cinnabar (HgS), sphalerite (ZnS), gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), barite
(BaSO4), and as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in natural gas and crude oil.
Sulphur is extracted from underground deposits of elemental sulphur by the Frasch process
(Figure 4.6 ). In this process, three concentric pipes are sent down to the sulphur deposit.
Superheated water at about 170oC is pumped through the outermost pipes. Hot air is
compressed in the innermost tube. A froth of sulphur, air and water come out to the surfaceof the earth forced by hot compressed air in the middle tube. The molten sulphur is thencooled and solidified.
Figure 4.6   Frasch Process for the production of sulphur.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
210Uses:  Nearly one-half of the sulphur needed by chemical industries is obtained as a waste
product of other industrial processes. For example, sulphur can be obtained in the form ofhydrogen sulphide (H
2S) from natural gas and during the purification of crude oil. It can
also be obtained in the form of sulphur dioxide from the roasting of sulphide ores during themanufacture of metals. The use of sulphur obtained from waste products of other industriesreduces the demand for the element from natural deposits. This also reduces the pollutionof atmospheric air and the formation of acid rain.
Sulphur exhibits allotropy. The most important allotropes of sulphur are rhombic  and
monoclinic sulphur. Rhombic sulphur is the most stable form of sulphur consisting of S
8
molecules.
Chemical Properties of Sulphur
Sulphur is relatively stable and unreactive at room temperature. However, it reacts with
metals and non-metals when heated.
Sulphur combines with metals when heated to form sulphides.

Sulphur is the raw material for the production of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) by the Contact
Process . This process of sulphuric acid production involves the following steps.
Step 1: Sulphur is first oxidized to produce sulphur dioxide:
S8 (s)    +   8O2 (g)    Æ    8SO2 (g)
Step 2: Sulphur dioxide is converted to sulphur trioxide at high temperatures in the presence
of a catalyst:
2SO2 (g)    +    O2    25VO →    2SO3 (g)
Step 3: Sulphur trioxide is absorbed into concentrated sulphuric acid to produce oleum
(H2S2O7).
SO3 (g) + H2SO4 (l)Æ H2S2O7 (l)
Step 4: The oleum is then diluted with water to produce the desired concentration of

and turns normal after a few minutes. Many people say that the white colour we see is due
to chlorine. Do you agree? Discuss in group and present your opinion to the class.
2.What is the purpose of adding chlorine to drinking water?
Occurrence and Extraction
Chlorine belongs to group VIIA, known as the halogens. It is the most abundant element
among the halogens. It is found in nature in the form of compounds only. Chlorine is foundin nature chiefly in the form of  chlorides of sodium , potassium , calcium and magnesium .
Sodium chloride is the chief source of chlorine, and it is obtained from seawater  or as
deposits of rock salt .
Commercially, chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of a concentrated aqueous solution
of sodium chloride. During electrolysis of the concentrated solution, chlorine is formed atthe anode and the reduction of water occurs at the cathode, producing hydrogen gas andhydroxide ions (OH
–). The electrode and the overall cell reactions are as follows:
Oxidation at anode: 2Cl– (aq) Æ Cl2 (g) + 2e–
Reduction at cathode: 2H2O (l) + 2e– Æ H2 (g) + 2OH– (aq)
Cell reaction: 2NaCl (aq) + 2H2O (l) Æ 2NaOH (aq) + Cl2 (g) + H2 (g)
Although NaOH forms at the cathode compartment and Cl2 at the anode, the two substances
must be kept apart from one another. This is because, if they come into contact with eachother, they can react according to the following equation.
NaOH (aq)    +    Cl

212Some of its physical properties are the following:
• Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas at room temperature.
• It melts at –102°C and boils at –34°C.
• It is fairly soluble in water.• It is extremely poisonous, causing inflammation of the lungs and mucous membranes
if inhaled, even in very small amounts. It is fatal if inhaled in higher amounts.
Chemical Properties of Chlorine
Chlorine is a highly reactive non-metal. It reacts directly with almost all elements exceptthe noble gases, carbon and nitrogen. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and oxidizes most of
the elements with which it reacts. The following are the main reactions of chlorine.

Chlorine is commercially used as a bleaching agent and disinfectant (kills germs). As
elemental chlorine or as chlorine water, it is strong enough to oxidize dyes and to bleach
coloured materials. For example, it can be used to remove yellow or brown colours from
wood pulp, paper and cotton.

214Glass
Glass is an amorphous or non-crystalline solid material. Almost all glass contains silica as
the main component. Quartz glass  is made by melting pure silica, SiO2, at a temperature of
about 2300°C and then pouring the molten viscous liquid into moulds. It is of high strength,low thermal expansion and highly transparent.
Soda-lime glass is ordinary glass which is a mixture of sodium silicate and calcium silicate.
It is made by heating a mixture of silica sand, sodium carbonate or sodium sulphate andlimestone. The reactions that take place in forming soda-lime glass are the following:
Na
2CO3+ SiO2Æ Na2SiO3+C O2
CaCO3+ SiO2Æ CaSiO3+C O2
Soda-lime glass accounts for about 90% of manufactured glass. This type of glass is widely
used for window panes, bottles, dishes etc.
Borosilicate glass  is commonly known as Pyrex . It is manufactured using boron (III)
oxide, B2O3, instead of limestone or calcium oxide. This glass has high resistance to chemical
corrosion and temperature changes and is widely used to make ovenware and laboratoryequipment such as flasks, beakers, and test tubes.
Steps in glass production
i) Batch preparation:  refers to the preparation of the raw materials according to the
appropriate combinations. The raw materials are mixed in a proportion of 60%sand, 21% sodium carbonate and 19% limestone.
ii) Glass melting:  The raw materials and recycled glass (according to their colour)
are fed into a glass-melting furnace. The materials are then heated to a temperatureof about 1600°C to form a molten viscous liquid. Why are glasses is separatedaccording to the colour?
The furnace operates continuously, producing glass 24 hours a day. Substances that
give the glass different colours or improved chemical and physical properties suchas transparency, thermal and chemical stability and mechanical strength are addedduring this process.PROJECT 4.2

2151.Are you familiar with the pottery industry? Do you know any ceramic factories in
Ethiopia?
3.Prepare a list of ceramic products used in daily life.
Discuss in groups and give presentation to the class.
Ceramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent
cooling. Traditional ceramics, such as porcelain, tiles and pottery are formed from minerals
such as clay, talc and feldspar . Most industrial ceramics, however, are formed from
extremely pure powders of specialty chemicals, such as silicon carbide , alumina , barium
titanate , and titanium carbide .
Manufacturing of ceramics
The minerals used to make ceramics are dug out of the earth and are then crushed and
ground into a fine powder. Manufacturers often purify this powder by mixing it in a solution
and allowing a chemical precipitate ( a uniform solid that forms within a solution ) to
form. The precipitate is then separated from the solution. The powder is heated to drive off
impurities including water.
The processes of manufacturing ceramics include:
A Moulding: After purification, small amounts of wax are often added to bind the ceramic
powder and make it more workable. Plastics may also be added to the powder togive the desired pliability and softness. The powder can then be shaped into differentobjects by various moulding processes.
B Densification:  The process of densification uses intense heat to condense a ceramic
object into a strong, dense product. After being moulded, the ceramic object isheated in an electric furnace to temperatures between 1000°C and 1700°C. As theiii) Glass forming:  This is the stage in which the melted glass is made into a required
shape.
iv) Annealing:  This is a process that involves the removal of internal stresses by reheating
the glass followed by a controlled slow-cooling cycle during which the stresses arerelieved.
v) Inspection:  It involves testing of the glass product to check whether it fulfils desired
quality requirements or not.
vi) Packing and dispatching is the final stage before distribution.
Ceramics

CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
216ceramic heats, the powder particles coalesce, much as water droplets join at room
temperature. As the ceramic particles merge, the object becomes increasingly dense,shrinking by up to 20 percent of its original size. The goal of this heating process isto maximize the strength of ceramic by obtaining an internal structure that is compactand extremely dense.
In general, most ceramics are hard and wear-resistant, brittle, refractory, thermal and
electrical insulators, non-magnetic, oxidation-resistant, and chemically stable.
Due to the wide range of properties of ceramic materials, they are used for a multitude of
applications.
•Well-known uses of ceramics : They are commonly found in art sculptures, dishes,
platters and other kitchenware, kitchen tiles and bath room structures.
•Lesser-known uses for ceramics:  They are used as electrical insulators,
computers parts, tools, dental replacements, engine parts, and tiles on space shuttlesand to replace bones such as the bones in hips, knees and shoulders.
•Future uses of ceramics:  In future, the ceramics might be used to remove impurities
from the drinking water, and to replace diseased heart valves.

such as clay to 1450°C in a kiln using a process known as calcination . The resulting hard
substance called ‘clinker’ is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder tomake “ ordinary Portland cement ” (OPC).
Cement mainly consists of calcium silicate (CaSiO
3), calcium aluminate (CaAl2O4),      iron
(III) oxide (Fe2O3) and magnesium oxide (MgO).
Portland cement is a very important building material, and was first discovered in England.
It received its name because, on setting, it hardens to a stone-like mass and was comparedto the famous Portland Rock of England. It is a mixture of calcium and aluminium silicateswith gypsum.
Raw Materials: Limestone and clay are the chief raw materials used in the
manufacture of Portland cement.Activity 4.17
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
217Manufacturing Process:  First, limestone and clay are crushed separately. They are
then mixed in the required quantities and finally mixed and ground together, which canbe done either by the dry or wet process. The wet process is suitable if the limestoneand clay are soft. If the raw materials are hard, the dry process is preferred. The dryprocess is cost-effective because fuel consumption is less when the raw materials areburnt in a rotary kiln.

The resulting mixture of all these silicates and aluminates is called cement clinker. After
cooling, it is mixed with 2-3% gypsum (calcium sulphate) and ground to a fine powder.Gypsum slows down the rate of setting of cement, so that the cement hardens adequately.

Setting of Cement
When mixed with water cement first forms a plastic mass that hardens after sometime. This
is due to the formation of three-dimensional cross-links between –Si–O–Si– and  –Si–O–
Al– chains.
The first setting occurs within 24 hours, whereas, the subsequent hardening requires about
two weeks. In the hardening process of cement, the transition from plastic to solid state iscalled setting .

Take a 0.5 kg of cement and mix it with correct proportion of sand and water. Mix
the compoment well till a palstic mass is formed. Take this plastic mass and constructa model of any object. Start pouring water on the model starting from the second dayonwards. Report the changes to the class after 24 hours and after two weeks.
Sugar Manufacturing
Activity 4.18
1.Prepare a list of foods and drinks used at your home in which sugar is an ingredient.
2.Is sugar made only from sugar cane? If no, what are the other sources?  Discuss in
group and give a presentation to the class.
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
219Sugarcane is a perennial herb belonging to the grass family. Native to tropical and subtropical
regions of the world, this tropical grass is about 3 metres tall.
Planting: Sugarcane is planted in fields by workers or mechanical planters. Typical cane
soil is made from the mixture of silts, clay particles and organic matter. Fertilizers areapplied from the time of planting up until the beginning of the ripening period, depending onthe region where the crop is planted. Cane seasons last from 8-22 months.
1. Collecting the Harvest: Mature canes are gathered by a combination of manual
and mechanical methods. The cane is cut at ground level, the leaves are removed,the top is trimmed off ( by cutting off the last mature joint ) the canes and transported
to a sugar factory.
2. Cleansing and Grinding:  The stalks are thoroughly washed and cut at the sugar
mill. After the cleaning process, a machine led by a series of rotating knives, shredsthe cane into pieces. This is known as “grinding”. During grinding, hot water issprayed onto the sugarcane to dissolve the remaining hard sugar. The shreddedcane is then spread out on a conveyer belt.
3. Juicing:  The shredded sugarcane travels on the conveyor belt through a series of
heavy -duty rollers, which extract juice from the pulp. The pulp that remains, or “bagasse”,
is dried and used as a fuel. The raw juice moves on through the mill to be clarified.
4. Clarifying:  Carbon dioxide and milk of lime are added to the liquid sugar mixture,
which is heated until boiling. The process of clarifying begins at this stage. As thecarbon dioxide moves through the liquid, it forms calcium carbonate, which attractsnon-sugar debris ( fats, gums  and waxes ) from the juice, and pulls them away from
the sugar juice. The juice is then pushed through a series of filters to remove anyremaining impurities.
5. Evaporation: The clear juice that results from the clarifying process is put under a
vacuum, where the juice boils at a low temperature and the water in it begins toevaporate. It is heated until it forms into thick, brown syrup.
6. Crystallization:  Crystallization is the process of evaporating the water from the
sugar syrup. Pulverized sugar is fed into a sterilized vacuum pan. As the liquidevaporates, crystals form. The remaining mixture is a thick mass of large crystals.These crystals are sent to a centrifuge that spins and dries them. The dried productis raw sugar , which is edible.
7. Refinery:  Raw sugar is transported to a cane sugar refinery for the removal of
molasses, minerals and other non-sugars that contaminate it. This is known as thepurification process . Raw sugar is mixed with a solution of sugar and water to loosen
the molasses from the outside of the raw sugar crystals, producing a thick matter
known as “magma” . Large machines then spin the magma, separating the molasses
from the crystals. The crystals are promptly washed, dissolved and filtered to removeimpurities. The golden syrup that is produced is then sent through filters, and SO
2 is
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
220passed through it to remove the colour and water. The process of removing colour
is known as bleaching .What is left is concentrated, clear syrup which is again fed
into a vacuum pan for evaporation.
8. Separation and packaging:  Once the final evaporation and drying process is done,
screens separate the different- sized sugar crystals. Large and small crystals arepackaged and labelled as white refined sugar.

221Discuss the following issues in the group and give a presentation to your class:
1.Wasting paper is like chopping down trees. Comment.
2.Some papers are relatively cheap. The paper used for this grade 10 text book, for
example, is expensive. Are different types of paper manufactured by different
processes?
Wood is the raw material for making wood pulp and paper. Wood pulp is a dry fibrous
material used for making paper. The timber resources used to make wood pulp are referredto as pulp wood . Wood pulp is made from soft-wood trees , such as spruce , pine, fir, larch
and hemlock , and from hard woods , such as eucalyptus , aspen and birch .
Wood is composed of cellulose, lignin, oils and resins. Lignin is used to bind fibres of
cellulose together. To provide wood pulp, the cellulose must be separated from the lignin.
Manufacturing of pulp and paper involves the following steps:
1. Harvesting  trees involves the cutting down of trees from their growing areas and
transporting the timber to the paper and pulp industry.
2. Preparation for pulping  is a step in which the bark of  the tree is removed and then
the wood is chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips ( pieces ).
3. Pulping is a step used to make wood pulp from the chipped wood pieces. This can
be accomplished by either mechanical or chemical means depending on the strengthand grade of paper to be manufactured.
a Mechanical pulping:   It utilizes steam, pressure and high temperatures instead
of chemicals to tear the fibres. The fibre quality is greatly reduced becausemechanical pulping creates short, weak fibres that still contain the lignin that bondsthe fibres together. Paper used for newspapers are a typical product ofmechanical pulping .
b Chemical pulping:  Chemical pulp is produced by combining wood chips and
chemicals in large vessels called digesters . Heat and the chemicals break down
the lignin which binds the cellulose fibres together without seriously degradingthe cellulose fibres. Chemical pulp is manufactured using the Kraft process or
the Sulphite Process .
i)The Kraft Process  is the dominant chemical pulping method. It is the most
widely used method for making pulp from all types of trees. The process usesPaper and Pulp
Activity 4.19
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
222aqueous sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide as a digestion solution. After
digestion for about four hours at a temperature of 170oC, the pulp is separated
by filtration. This process uses a basic digestion medium.
ii)The Sulphite Process  uses a cooking liquor ( digestion ) solution of sodium
bisulphate or magnesium bisulphate digester at pH of about 3 in a pulp.The action of the hydrogen sulphide ions at 60
oC over 6 to 12 hours dissolves
the lignin and separates it from the cellulose. After the process is complete,the pulp is recovered by filtration.
The wood pulp achieved from the Sulphite or Kraft processes is washed to
remove chemicals and passed through a series of screens to remove foreignmaterials.
4. Bleaching:  It is the process of removing colouring matter from wood pulp and
increasing its brightness. The most common bleaching agents are strong oxidizingagents such as chlorine , chlorine oxide , ozone and hydrogen peroxide .
5. Making paper from pulp:  After bleaching, the pulp is processed into liquid stock
that can be transferred to a paper mill. The suspension is poured onto a continuouslymoving screen belt and the liquor is allowed to seep away by gravity to producepaper sheet. The continuous sheet then moves through additional rollers that compressthe fibres and remove the residual water to produce fine paper.
Tannery
1.The leather products of Ethiopia are durable and relatively cheaper than the same
products imported from outside. Why do people prefer to buy imported products?
What can you suggest to change this attitude? Discuss this matter in class in relation to
quality and availability of resources.
2.Why are leather products being replaced by synthetic products?
Discuss in groups and present to the class.
Tanning is a process of converting raw animal hides and skin to leather, using tannin. Leather
is a durable and flexible material created by the tanning of animal hides and skin. Tannin isan acidic chemical that permanently alters the protein structure of a skin so that it can neverreturn to rawhide or skin again.
Leather production involves various preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting
1. Preparatory stages  are those in which the hide or skin is prepared for tanning.
This stage includes curing , soaking , flesh removal , hair removal , scudding , and
deliming .Activity 4.20
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
223a Curing:  This process involves salting or drying the hide once it has been removed
from the animal. Curing is employed to prevent putrefaction of the proteinsubstance, collagen, from bacterial infection. Curing also removes excess waterfrom the hide and skin. Brine curing is the simplest and fastest method.
b Soaking :  In this process, cured hides are soaked in water for several hours to
several days to remove salt, dirt, debris, blood and excess animal fat from theskin.
c Flesh removal:  In this process, animal hides are moved through a machine
that strips the flesh from the surface of the hide.
d Hair removal:  In this step, the soaked hides and skins are transported to large
vats where they are immersed in a mixture of lime and water. This process iscalled liming . It loosens the hair from the skin and makes hair-removal easier.
After 1–10 days soaking, the hair is mechanically removed from the hide by ahair-removing machine.
e Scudding:   This is the process in which hair and fat missed by the machines are
removed from the hide with a plastic tool or dull knife.
f Deliming:   This process involves the removal of lime from the skin or hide in a
vat of acid. After this preparatory process, the skin or hide is ready for tanning.
2. Tanning  is a process that converts the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable
material. There are two main types of tanning:
a Vegetable or natural tanning:  The skin is placed in a solution of tannin. Tannins
occur naturally in the barks and leaves of many plants. The primary barks used inmodern times are chestnut , oak, tanoak , hemlock , quebracho , mangrove ,
wattle (acacia) and myrobalan .  Naturally tanned hide is flexible and is used
for making shoes, luggage and furniture.
b Mineral tanning:  In this process, the skin is placed in solutions of chemicals
such as chromium sulphate and other salts of chromium. Chrome tanning is fasterthan natural ( vegetable ) tanning and requires only twenty four hours. The leather
is greenish-blue in colour derived from the chromium. This process producesstretchable leather that is used for making garments and handbags.
3. Crusting : This is the final stage in leather manufacturing and includes dyeing, rolling
the leather to make it strong, stretching it in a heat-controlled room and performinga process that involves covering the grain surface with chemical compounds such aswax, oil, glazes etc. to make the leather very attractive.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
2241.The rate of spoilage of food is faster in open air in comparison to foods kept inside the
refrigerator. Explain. Discuss in group and present your findings to the class.
Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or greatly reduce
spoilage, loss of quality, edibility or nutritive value caused or accelerated by micro-organisms.
Preservation usually involves preventing the growth of bacteria, fungi and other micro-
organisms, as well as reducing the oxidation of fats, which causes rancidity.Food Processing and Preservation
1.What are the traditional methods used to preserve food for a long time without
spoilage at your home?
2.What modern methods of food preserving and processing do we use in Ethiopia?
Discuss in groups and give a presentation to the class.
Modern methods of food preservation are:
a Freezing:  This is one of the most commonly used processes, commercially and
domestically, for preserving a very wide range of  foods such as potatoes, as well asprepared foodstuffs that would not require freezing in their normal state.
b Freeze-drying:  Water vapour has easier access through the cell structure of any
product compared to water-penetrating the product and evaporating from the surfaceof the product as is the case of other drying methods. The gentle escape of watervapour in the freeze-drying process leaves the product close to its original shape,taste, and colour and there is no loss of aroma or flavour.
For example, liquids such as coffee, tea, juices and other extracts, vegetables,
segments of fish and meat products. Freeze-drying is a superior preservation methodfor a variety of food products and food ingredients.
c Vacuum-packing:  Stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag
or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria of the oxygen needed for survival,slowing down the rate of spoiling. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storingnuts to reduce loss of flavour from oxidation.Activity 4.22

warming.
Discuss in your group and present to the class.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
226Pollution  is any discharge of a solid, liquid or gaseous substance or radiation ( energy ) into
an environment that causes unwanted changes. Pollution causes short-term or long-termharm that affects the earth’s ecological balance and lowers the quality of life in theenvironment. A pollutant is any substance that changes air, water or any other natural
resource in a way that impairs the use of the resource.
Pollutants are discharged into the environment as a result of natural events (like a volcanic
eruption) and as a result of human activities (such as the operation of chemical industries,agriculture, etc.). Pollutants can be classified by the type of pollution they cause: air pollution,
water pollution , and land pollution .
Air Pollution
1.Based on the situation of your locality, discuss the following issues in groups and
present the findings to the class:
aList some human activities which contribute to air pollution.
bHow these activities contribute to air pollution?
cWhat solutions do you recommend to overcome these problems?
dWhat could be your contribution to reduce air pollutions?
2.Give your suggestions on the statement, ‘Air pollution any where is a potential threat
elsewhere.’
Air pollution is caused by the presence of contaminant gaseous substances in the air that
affect the lives of plants and animals on earth. Some common air pollutants are sulphur
dioxide , nitrogen oxides , carbon monoxide , ozone , hydrocarbons , particulates ,
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) , and lead compounds .
Sulphur dioxide (SO2): This enters the atmospheric air from the combustion of coal and
petroleum, and during extraction of metals from their sulphide ores. It causes coughing,chest pains and shortness of breath.  It is thought to be a cause for bronchitis and lungdiseases. It slowly oxidizes to SO
3 by reacting with the oxygen in the air.
Oxides of nitrogen:  These  can be formed in the atmosphere by natural processes like
thunderstorms. Combustion of fossil fuel containing nitrogen compounds as impurities andexhaust gases from furnaces and engines increase the amount of nitric oxide, NO, andnitrogen dioxide, NO
2, in the atmosphere. Nitric oxide, NO, catalyzes the decomposition
of ozone in the upper layer of the atmosphere to oxygen, thus decreasing the ozone layer.
2O3 (g) NO→ 3O2 (g)Activity 4.24
CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
227Nitric oxide is oxidized by oxygen to nitrogen dioxide in the presence of ultraviolet light.
2NO (g)    +    O2 (g)    Æ    2NO2 (g)
SO2, SO3 and NO2 react with rainwater and form sulphurous acid (H2SO3), sulphuric
acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), respectively and cause acid rain. Acid rain accelerates
corrosion and the deterioration of metals, buildings, statues and also causes tree defoliation,release of heavy metal ions from soil into water courses and drop in the pH of water inrivers and lakes.
Hydrocarbons and ozone  are responsible for photochemical smog. It is characterized by
a reddish-brown haze containing substances irritating to the eye, nose, and lungs, andcauses extensive damage to vegetation. Considerable amounts of hydrocarbons are releasedinto the atmosphere by the evaporation of gasoline as unburnt hydrocarbons in auto exhaust.These substances react with ozone to give compounds that contribute to the oxidizingnature of photochemical smog.
Carbon monoxide:  Most of the carbon monoxide escapes into the atmosphere due to
the incomplete combustion of fuel. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide impairs vision,produces headaches, and exerts strain on the heart. It also reduces the oxygen-carryingcapacity of the blood by reacting with haemoglobin.
Particulates: Dust storms, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and human activities such as
mining and burning coal and oil increase the amount of solid particles in the air. Industrialareas contain particles of limestone, fertilizers, coal, stones, cement and silica. Theseparticulates irritate the lungs and deleteriously affect breathing.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):  Chlorofluorocarbons are used as refrigerants, solvents
and plastic foam-blowing agents. When entering the atmosphere, they penetrate into theupper layers and interact with ultraviolet radiation as follows.
CF
2Cl2    UV→   CF2Cl.    +    .Cl
The free chlorine, Cl, reacts with ozone to form chlorine monoxide and oxygen.
.Cl    +    O3    Æ    ClO .    +    O2
These reactions result in the conversion of o zone to molecular oxygen and contribute to
depletion of the ozone layer. This situation in the up per atmosphere allows dangerous
ultravi olet radiation to reach the earth’s surface. This radiation causes skin cancer in human beings.
Excess carbon dioxide: The combustion of coal and petroleum to generate electricity,
move our vehicles, heat  our homes and supply power to our industrial machinery causes a
significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Combustion
of these fuels releases about 20 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. The increase in the
concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has resulted in a rise in the average global
temperature, owing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide and water vapour absorb
infrared radiation, re-radiated from the earth, behaving like the glass in a green house.
Since CO2 and water vapour absorb heat they are called green-house gases . Due to the
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
228absorption of heat by the green house gases in the atmosphere, the overall effect is global
warming ( an increase in the average temperature of our planet ). This rise in global
temperature causes melting of polar ice and thus additional water flowing into the oceans.This situation, in turn, results in the rising of the levels of seas and oceans, flooding ofcoastlines and lowland areas, which can submerge these areas.
Heavy metals:  Lead contamination in the atmosphere is a result of vehicle engines that
use fuels containing tetraethyl lead which is added to the fuel to reduce engine knocking.
The use of lead paints also contributes towards lead contamination. High levels of lead
cause damage to the brain, kidneys and liver.

CHEMISTRY IN INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (UNIT 4)
229Water pollution is the degradation of the quality of water brought about by the discharge
into it of untreated sewage, industrial and agricultural waste, and oil spillage. In general,water is said to be polluted if it contains matter that affects the health of living things orcauses damage to property. The major water pollutants are nitrate and phosphate fertilisers
washed out of the soil, phosphate detergents, untreated sewage, insecticides and herbicides,
and the heavy metal ion, acidic and/or basic residues released by industrial processes.
Phosphate and nitrate fertilisers  washed out of the soil and phosphate detergents from
untreated water, enter natural water systems, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and seas.These dissolved minerals are valuable nutrients for plants, and their discharge into thewater systems accelerates the growth of surface-water plants, such as algae. As a result,less light reaches the bottom-living plants, which reduces the photosynthesis they need to
live, and they die. When these aquatic plants die, they rot under the action of bacteria
which multiply greatly and consume the oxygen dissolved in the water at a rate faster thannatural aeration or photosynthesis can replenish. Thus, the amount of oxygen in the waterdecreases. This depletion of oxygen kills aquatic animals like fish. This sequence of eventsis called eutrophication .
Insecticides (pesticides) and herbicides  applied in agriculture may also be washed into
lakes, rivers, streams and seas. Some of the insecticides and herbicides do not decompose
easily and are persistent in the environment. Residues of these insecticides and herbicidesmay enter the food chains and accumulate in an organism that is consumed by the nextorganism. The increasing amount of insecticide and herbicide residue in the bodies ofanimals causes health and behavioural problems.
The release of heavy metal ions, acidic and/or basic residues from industrial processes into
natural water systems, such as lakes and rivers, causes pH changes in the water. Water
organisms need specific ranges of water pH to survive, so these changes in pH can killthem. In the same way, increasing concentrations of toxic metal ions kills some aquaticorganisms.
The release of untreated sewage to natural water systems can spread water-borne diseases
such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and polio.
Methods of Reducing Water Pollution:
1.Treatment of water before discharge into rivers and lakes.
2.To avoid unnatural temperature changes in natural water systems, industries should
not discharge heat-ladened water into them.
3.Recycling industrial and agricultural wastes.
4.Using moderate amounts of agricultural chemicals and increasing the use of organic
fertilizers and biological methods to control pests.

3.Do you observe soil erosion in your area? What three major things do you believe
elected officials should take to decrease soil erosion in the region you live?
4.What should be your responsibility in solving the land pollution problems?
Land pollution is caused by things we put into it. It results from the spillage of oil,
leaching of harmful chemicals and heavy metal ions, and dumping of non-biodegradable wastes such as plastics.
Factors involved in land pollution include:
• Spillages of oil from leaking pipelines.
• Harmful heavy metal ions from buried waste leaching into water systems.
• Leaching of harmful chemicals from corroded metal drums which have been buried
underground.
• Dumping of non-biodegradable ( do not decompose by the action of bacteria )
wastes like plastics which remain unchanged in the soil for decades or hundreds ofyears. Their accumulation in the soil hinders air and water movement and affects the
growth of plants.
• Excessive use of synthetic fertilisers in agricultural activities also contributes towards
land pollution.

Concepts and SkillsAs you wander through the supermarket, some advertising claims catch
your eye. “Certiﬁed organic” and “all natural” are stamped on the labels of some foods. Other labels claim that the foods are “chemical free.” As achemistry student, you are aware that these labels may be misleading. Areall “chemicals” harmful in food, as some of the current advertising suggests?
Many terms are used inaccurately in everyday life. The word “natural”
is often used in a manner suggesting that all natural compounds are safeand healthy. Similarly, the word “chemical” is commonly used to refer toartiﬁcial compounds only. The food industry uses “organic” to indicatefoods that have been grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, hormones, and other synthetic chemicals. The original meaningof the word “organic” refers to anything that is or has been alive. In thissense, allvegetables are organic, no matter how they are grown.
Organic chemistry is the study of compounds that are based on
carbon. Natural gas, rubbing alcohol, aspirin, and the compounds thatgive fragrance to a rose, are all organic compounds.

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 5Bonding and the
Shape of Organic Molecules
Early scientists deﬁned organic compounds as compounds that originate
from living things. In 1828, however, the German chemist Friedrich Wohler(1800–1882) made an organic compound called urea, CO(NH
2)2, out of an
inorganic compound called ammonium cyanate, NH 4CN. Urea is found in
the urine of mammals. This was the ﬁrst time in history that a compoundnormally made only by living things was made from a non-living sub-stance. Since Wohler had discovered that organic compounds can be madewithout the involvement of a life process, a new deﬁnition was required.Organic compounds are now deﬁned as compounds that are based on
carbon. They usually contain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds.
The Carbon Atom
There are several million organic compounds, but only about a quarter of a million inorganic compounds (compounds that are not based on carbon). Why are there so many organic compounds? The answer lies inthe bonding properties of carbon.
As shown in Figure 1.1, each carbon atom usually forms a total of
four covalent bonds . Thus, a carbon atom can connect to as many as four
other atoms. Carbon can bond to many other types of atoms, includinghydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
This Lewis structure shows methane, the simplest organic compound. The
carbon atom has four valence electrons, and it obtains four more electrons by forming fourcovalent bonds with the four hydrogen atoms.
In addition, carbon atoms can form strong single, double, or triple bonds
with other carbon atoms . In a single carbon-carbon bond, one pair of
electrons is shared between two carbon atoms. In a double bond, twopairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. In a triple bond, threepairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.
Molecules that contain only single carbon-carbon bonds are saturated .
In other words, all carbon atoms are bonded to the maximum number ofother atoms: four. No more bonding can occur. Molecules that containdouble or triple carbon-carbon bonds are unsaturated . The carbon atoms
on either side of the double or triple bond are bonded to less than fouratoms each. There is potential for more atoms to bond to each of these carbon atoms.
Carbon’s unique bonding properties allow the formation of a
variety of structures, including chains and rings of many shapes and sizes. Figure 1.2 on the next page illustrates some of the many shapes that can be formed from a backbone of carbon atoms. This ﬁgure includesexamples of three types of structural diagrams that are used to depictorganic molecules. (The Concepts and Skills Review contains a furtherreview of these types of structural diagrams.)Figure 1.1 + 4H→ C

In the chapter opener, you
considered how the terms“natural” and “chemical” areused inaccurately. A natural
substance is a substance thatoccurs in nature and is notartiﬁcial. A chemical is any
substance that has been madeusing chemical processes in a laboratory. A chemical canalso be deﬁned as any sub-stance that is composed ofatoms. This deﬁnition coversmost things on Earth. Go to the web site above, and click onWeb Links to ﬁnd out where
to go next. Look up some natural poisons, pesticides,
and antibiotics that are produced by animals, plants,and bacteria. Then look upsome beneﬁcial chemicals
that have been synthesized by humans. Make a poster toillustrate your ﬁndings.LINK Web

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 7Table 1.1 Common Molecular Shapes in Organic Molecules
Three-Dimensional Structural Diagrams
Two-dimensional structural diagrams of organic compounds, such as
condensed structural diagrams and line structural diagrams, work well for ﬂat molecules. As shown in the table above, however, molecules
containing single-bonded carbon atoms are not ﬂat.
You can use a three-dimensional structural diagram to draw the tetra-
hedral shape around a single-bonded carbon atom. In a three-dimensionaldiagram, wedges are used to give the impression that an atom or group iscoming forward, out of the page. Dashed or dotted lines are used to showthat an atom or group is receding, or being pushed back into the page. InFigure 1.3, the Cl atom is coming forward, and the Br atom is behind. Thetwo H atoms are ﬂat against the surface of the page.

The shape around this carbon atom is linear . The
two atoms bonded to the carbon atom are stretched out to either side to form a straight line.
A single-bonded oxygen atom forms two bonds.
An oxygen atom also has two pairs of non-bonding electrons, called lone pairs. Since there are a total of four electron pairs around a single-bonded oxygen atom, the shape around this oxygen atom is a variation of the tetrahedral shape. Because there are only two bonds, however, the shape around a single-bonded oxygen atom is usually referred to as bent.C CH

8 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryMolecular Shape and Polarity
The three-dimensional shape of a molecule is particularly important when
the molecule contains polar covalent bonds. As you may recall from yourprevious chemistry course, a polar covalent bond is a covalent bond
between two atoms with different electronegativities.
Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts
electrons in a chemical bond. The electrons in a polar covalent bond areattracted more strongly to the atom with the higher electronegativity. Thisatom has a partial negative charge, while the other atom has a partial posi-tive charge. Thus, every polar bond has a bond dipole : a partial negative
charge and a partial positive charge, separated by the length of the bond.Figure 1.4 illustrates the polarity of a double carbon-oxygen bond. Oxygenhas a higher electronegativity than carbon. Therefore, the oxygen atom ina carbon-oxygen bond has a partial negative charge, and the carbon atomhas a partial positive charge.
Dipoles are often represented using vectors . Vectors are arrows that have
direction and location in space.
Other examples of polar covalent bonds include C /H11002O, O/H11002H,
and N/H11002H. Carbon and hydrogen attract electrons to almost the same
degree. Therefore, when carbon is bonded to another carbon atom or to a hydrogen atom, the bond is not usually considered to be polar. Forexample, C
/H11002C bonds are considered to be non-polar.
Predicting Molecular Polarity
A molecule is considered to be polar , or to have a molecular polarity ,
when the molecule has an overall imbalance of charge. That is, the molecule has a region with a partial positive charge, and a region with apartial negative charge. Surprisingly, not all molecules with polar bondsare polar molecules. For example, a carbon dioxide molecule has twopolar C
/H11005O bonds, but it is not a polar molecule. On the other hand, a
water molecule has two polar O /H11002H bonds, and it isa polar molecule.
How do you predict whether or not a molecule that contains polar bondshas an overall molecular polarity? To determine molecular polarity, youmust consider the shape of the molecule and the bond dipoles within themolecule.
If equal bond dipoles act in opposite directions in three-dimensional
space ,they counteract each other . A molecule with identical polar bonds
that point in opposite directions is not polar. Figure 1.5 shows two examples, carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride. Carbon dioxide, CO
2,
has two polar C /H11005O bonds acting in opposite directions, so the molecule
is non-polar. Carbon tetrachloride, CCl 4, has four polar C /H11002Cl bonds in
a tetrahedral shape. You can prove mathematically that four identicaldipoles, pointing toward the vertices of a tetrahedron, counteract eachother exactly. (Note that this mathematical proof only applies if all fourbonds are identical.) Therefore, carbon tetrachloride is also non-polar.Figure 1.4Cδ+ δ−
Opartial positive charge partial negative charge

In this unit, you will encounter
the following polar bonds:C
/H11002I, C/H11002F, C/H11002O, O/H11002H,
N/H11002H, and C /H11002N. Use the
electronegativities in the periodic table to discoverwhich atom in each bond hasa partial negative charge, andwhich has a partial positivecharge.
Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 9The red colour indicates a region of negative charge, and the blue colour
indicates a region of positive charge. In non-polar molecules, such as carbon dioxide (A) andcarbon tetrachloride (B), the charges are distributed evenly around the molecule.
If the bond dipoles in a molecule do not counteract each other exactly, the
molecule is polar . Two examples are water, H2O, and chloroform, CHCl 3,
shown in Figure 1.6. Although each molecule has polar bonds, the bonddipoles do not act in exactly opposite directions. The bond dipoles do notcounteract each other, so these two molecules are polar.
In polar molecules, such as water (A) and chloroform (B), the charges are
distributed unevenly around the molecule. One part of the molecule has an overall negativecharge, and another part has an overall positive charge.
The steps below summarize how to predict whether or not a molecule
is polar. The Sample Problem that follows gives three examples.Note: For the purpose of predicting molecular polarity, you can assume
that C
/H11002H bonds are non-polar. In fact, they have a very low polarity.
Step 1 Does the molecule have polar bonds? If your answer is no, seebelow. If your answer is yes, go to step 2.
If a molecule has no polar bonds ,it is non -polar .
Examples: CH
3CH2CH3, CH2/H11005CH2
Step 2 Is there more than one polar bond? If your answer is no, see below.
If your answer is yes, go to step 3.
If a molecule contains only one polar bond ,it is polar .
Examples: CH3Cl, CH3CH2CH2Cl
Step 3 Do the bond dipoles act in opposite directions and counteract each
other? Use your knowledge of three-dimensional molecular shapesto help you answer this question. If in doubt, use a molecular modelto help you visualize the shape of the molecule.
If a molecule contains bond dipoles that do not counteract each
other ,the molecule is polar .
Examples: H
2O, CHCl 3
If the molecule contains dipoles that counteract each other ,the
molecule is non -polar .

Solution
(a) Step 1 Does the molecule have polar bonds? H /H11002C and C /H11002C
bonds are usually considered to be non-polar. Thus, this molecule is non-polar.
(b) Steps 1 and 2 Does the molecule have polar bonds? Is there more
than one polar bond? The C /H11002O and O /H11002H bonds are polar.
Step 3 Do the bond dipoles counteract each other? The shape around
oxygen is bent, and the dipoles are unequal. Therefore, these dipolesdo not counteract each other. The molecule has an overall polarity.
(c) Steps 1 and 2 Does the molecule have polar bonds? Is there more
than one polar bond? The C /H11002Cl bonds are polar.
Step 3 Do the bond dipoles counteract each other? If you make a

opposite directions. They counteract each other. Thus, this moleculeis non-polar.HHC l

Molecular PolarityThe polarity of a molecule
determines its solubility. Polarmolecules attract each other,so polar molecules usually dissolve in polar solvents, such as water. Non-polar molecules do not attract polar molecules enough tocompete against the strongattraction between polar molecules. Therefore, non-polar molecules are not usually soluble in water.Instead, they dissolve in non-polar solvents, such as benzene.FACTCHEM

Specific Expectations  Hydrocarbons
In this section, you will review the structure and names of hydrocarbons.
As you may recall from your previous chemistry studies, hydrocarbons
are the simplest type of organic compound. Hydrocarbons are composedentirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and are widely used as fuels.Gasoline, propane, and natural gas are common examples of hydrocarbons.Because they contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, hydrocarbons arenon-polar compounds.
Scientists classify hydrocarbons as either aliphatic or aromatic. An
aliphatic hydrocarbon contains carbon atoms that are bonded in one or
more chains and rings. The carbon atoms have single, double, or triplebonds. Aliphatic hydrocarbons include straight chain and cyclic alkanes,alkenes, and alkynes. An aromatic hydrocarbon is a hydrocarbon based
on the aromatic benzene group. You will encouter this group later in the section. Benzene is the simplest aromatic compound. Its bondingarrangement results in special molecular stability.
Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes
An alkane is a hydrocarbon that has only single bonds. Alkanes that do not
contain rings have the formula CnH2n+2. An alkane in the shape of a ring is
called a cycloalkane . Cycloalkanes have the formula CnH2n. An alkene is a
compound that has at least one double bond. Straight-chain alkenes withone double bond have the same formula as cycloalkanes, C
nH2n.
A double bond involves two pairs of electrons. In a double bond, one
pair of electrons forms a single bond and the other pair forms an addition-al, weaker bond. The electrons in the additional, weaker bond react fasterthan the electrons in the single bond. Thus, carbon-carbon double bondsare more reactive than carbon-carbon single bonds. When an alkenereacts, the reaction almost always occurs at the site of the double bond.
A functional group is a reactive group of bonded atoms that appears
in all the members of a chemical family. Each functional group reacts in acharacteristic way. Thus, functional groups help to determine the physicaland chemical properties of compounds. For example, the reactive doublebond is the functional group for an alkene. In this course, you willencounter many different functional groups.
An alkyne is a compound that has at least one triple bond. A straight-
chain alkyne with one triple bond has the formula C
nH2n−2. Triple bonds
are even more reactive than double bonds. The functional group for analkyne is the triple bond.
Figure 1.7 gives examples of an alkane, a cycloalkane, an alkene, and
an alkyne.
Identify each compound as an alkane, a cycloalkane, an alkene, or an alkyne. Figure 1.7CH3CH2CH2CH3

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 13General Rules for Naming Organic Compounds
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has set
standard rules for naming organic compounds. The systematic (or IUPAC)names of alkanes and most other organic compounds follow the same pattern, shown below.
The Root: How Long Is the Main Chain?
The root of a compound ’s name indicates the number of carbon atoms in
the main (parent) chain or ring. Table 1.2 gives the roots for hydrocarbonchains that are up to ten carbons long. To determine which root to use,count the carbons in the main chain, or main ring, of the compound. If thecompound is an alkene or alkyne, the main chain or ring must include themultiple bond.
Table 1.2 Root Names
Figure 1.8 shows some hydrocarbons, with the main chain or ring
highlighted.
(A) There are six carbons in the main chain. The root is -hex-. (B) There are ﬁve
carbons in the main ring. The root is -pent-.
The Sufﬁx: What Family Does the Compound Belong To?
The suf ﬁx indicates the type of compound, according to the functional
groups present. (See Table 1.4 on page 22.) As you progress through thischapter, you will learn the suf ﬁxes for different chemical families. In your
previous chemistry course, you learned the suf ﬁxes - anefor alkanes, - ene
for alkenes, and - ynefor alkynes. Thus, an alkane composed of six carbon
atoms in a chain is called hexane . An alkene with three carbons is called
propene .Figure 1.8CH HC CH3

14 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryThe Preﬁx: What Is Attached to the Main Chain?
The pre ﬁx indicates the name and location of each branch and functional
group on the main carbon chain. Most organic compounds have branches,called alkyl groups, attached to the main chain. An alkyl group is obtained
by removing one hydrogen atom from an alkane. To name an alkyl group,change the -ane suf ﬁx to -yl. For example,
/H11002CH3is the alkyl group that is
derived from methane, CH4. It is called the methyl group, taken from the
root meth-. Table 1.3 gives the names of the most common alkyl groups.
Read the steps below to review how to name hydrocarbons. Then examine
the two Sample Problems that follow.
How to Name Hydrocarbons
Step 1 Find the root: Identify the longest chain or ring in the hydrocarbon.
If the hydrocarbon is an alkene or an alkyne, make sure that youinclude any multiple bonds in the main chain. Remember that thechain does not have to be in a straight line. Count the number ofcarbon atoms in the main chain to obtain the root. If it is a cycliccompound, add the pre ﬁx -cyclo- before the root.
Step 2 Find the suf ﬁx: If the hydrocarbon is an alkane, use the suf ﬁx -ane.
Use -ene if the hydrocarbon is an alkene. Use -yne if the hydrocarbonis an alkyne. If more than one double or triple bond is present, usethe pre ﬁx di- (2) or tri- (3) before the suf ﬁx to indicate the number
of multiple bonds.
Step 3 Give a position number to every carbon atom in the main chain.Start from the end that gives you the lowest possible position number for the double or triple bond, if there is one. If there is nodouble or triple bond, number the compound so that the brancheshave the lowest possible position numbers.
Step 4 Find the pre ﬁx: Name each branch as an alkyl group, and give it
a position number. If more than one branch is present, write thenames of the branches in alphabetical order. Put the position number of any double or triple bonds after the position numbers
and names of the branches, just before the root. This is the pre ﬁx.
Note: Use the carbon atom with the lowest position number to give
the location of a double or triple bond.
Step 5 Put the name together: pre ﬁx +root +sufﬁx.Table 1.3  Common Alkyl Groups

Careers in Chemistry
The Art and Science of Perfumery
Since 1932, The Quiggs have manufactured perfume
compounds for cosmetics, toiletries, soaps, air fresh-eners, candles, detergents, and industrial cleaningproducts.
Jeff Quigg says the mixing of a perfume is “a
trial and error process. ” An experienced perfumer
must memorize a vast library of hundreds or eventhousands of individual scents and combinations ofscents. Perfume ingredients can be divided into natural essential oils (derived directly from plants)
and aromatic chemicals (synthetically produced
fragrance components).
Essential oils are organic compounds derived
from ﬂowers, seeds, leaves, roots, resins, and citrus
fruits. The structures of many fragrant compoundshave been studied, and processes for making thesevaluable compounds in a laboratory have beendeveloped. There are now approximately 5000 synthetically produced chemicals that are availableto a perfumer. These chemicals include vanillin, rose oxides, and the damascones , or rose ketones.
An aspiring perfumer must have a discrimi-
nating sense of smell. As well, a perfumist shouldobtain at least a bachelor of science degree in chemistry, or a degree in chemical engineering.There are few formal schools for perfumers, so companies usually train perfumers in-house.
The training takes ﬁve to ten years to complete.
Although inventors are trying to develop
electronic and arti ﬁcial noses to detect odours, they
have not yet been able to duplicate the sensitivenose of a skilled, trained, and talented perfumer.
Making Career Connections
1.Perfume schools exist, but admission is very
competitive. One of these schools is the InstitutSupérieur International du Parfum, de la

18 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryAromatic Compounds
If you completed the Concept Check activity on page 12, you drew a
possible structure for benzene. For many years, scientists could not determine the structure of benzene. From its molecular formula, C
6H6,
scientists reasoned that it should contain two double bonds and one triplebond, or even two triple bonds. Benzene, however, does not undergo thesame reactions as other compounds with double or triple bonds.
We know today that benzene is a cyclic compound with the equivalent
of three double bonds and three single bonds, as shown in Figure 1.9(A).However, the electrons that form the double bonds in benzene are spreadout and shared over the whole molecule. Thus, benzene actually has sixidentical bonds, each one half-way between a single and a double bond.These bonds are much more stable than ordinary double bonds and do not react in the same way. Figure 1.9(B) shows a more accurate way torepresent the bonding in benzene. Molecules with this type of specialelectron sharing are called aromatic compounds . As mentioned earlier,
benzene is the simplest aromatic compound.
Figure 1.10 illustrates some common aromatic compounds. To name
an aromatic compound, follow the steps below. Figure 1.11 gives anexample.
The common name for methylbenzene is toluene. Toluene is used to produce
explosives, such as trinitrotoluene (TNT). Phenylethene, with the common name styrene, is animportant ingredient in the production of plastics and rubber.
Naming an Aromatic Hydrocarbon
Step 1 Number the carbons in the benzene ring. If more than one type of
branch is attached to the ring, start numbering at the carbon withthe highest priority (or most complex) group. (See the Problem Tip.)
Step 2 Name any branches that are attached to the benzene ring. Give these branches position numbers. If only one branch is attached to a benzene ring, you do not need to include a position number.
Step 3 Place the branch numbers and names as a pre ﬁx before the root,
benzene.
Two ethyl groups are present. They have the position numbers 1 and 3. The
name of this compound is 1,3-diethylbenzene.Figure 1.1156

When you cut yourself, it is often a good idea to swab the cut with
rubbing alcohol to disinfect it. Most rubbing alcohols that are sold indrugstores are based on 2-propanol (common name: isopropanol), C
3H8O.
You can also swab a cut with a rubbing alcohol based on ethanol, C2H6O.
Often it is hard to tell the difference between these two compounds. Bothhave a sharp smell, and both evaporate quickly. Both are effective atkilling bacteria and disinfecting wounds. What is the connection betweenthese compounds? Why is their behaviour so similar?
Functional Groups
Both 2-propanol and ethanol contain the same functional group, an
/H11002OH (hydroxyl) group , as shown in Figure 1.12. Because ethanol and
2-propanol have the same OH functional group, their behaviour is similar.
Ethanol and 2-propanol both belong to the alcohol family.
The general formula for a family of simple organic compounds is
R+functional group . The letter Rstands for any alkyl group. (If more
than one alkyl group is present, R′and R′′are also used.) For example,
the general formula R /H11002OH refers to any of the following compounds:
CH3OH, CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2CH2OH, CH3CH2CH2CH2OH, etc.
Organic compounds are named according to their functional group.
Generally, the suf ﬁx of a compound ’s name indicates the most important
functional group in the molecule. For example, the suf ﬁx -ene indicates
the presence of a double bond, and the suf ﬁx -ol indicates the presence
of a hydroxyl group.
Functional groups are a useful way to classify organic compounds,
for two reasons:
1.Compounds with the same functional group often have similar physical properties . In the next two sections, you will learn to
recognize various functional groups. You will use functional groups to help you predict the physical properties of compounds.
2.Compounds with the same functional group react chemically in verysimilar ways . In Chapter 2, you will learn how compounds with each
functional group react.

Physical Properties and Forces Between Molecules
Organic compounds that have the same functional group often have
similar physical properties, such as boiling points, melting points, andsolubilities. Physical properties are largely determined by intermolecular
forces , the forces of attraction and repulsion between particles. Three
types of intermolecular forces are introduced below. You will examinethese forces further in Chapter 4.
•Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular attraction between the
hydrogen atom from an N
/H11002H, O/H11002H, or F /H11002H group on one molecule,
and a nitrogen, oxygen, or ﬂuorine atom on another molecule.
•The attractive forces between polar molecules are called dipole-dipole
interactions . These forces cause polar molecules to cling to each other.
•Dispersion forces are attractive forces that occur between all covalent
molecules. These forces are usually very weak for small molecules, butthey strengthen as the size of the molecule increases.
The process that is outlined on the next page will help you to predict the
physical properties of organic compounds by examining the intermolecularforces between molecules. As you progress through the chapter, referringback to this process will enable you to understand the reasons behindtrends in physical properties.-ane none alkane

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 23Intermolecular Forces and Physical Properties
Draw two or three molecules of the same organic compound close
together on a page. If you are considering the solubility of one com-pound in another, sketch the two different molecules close together.Ask the following questions about the intermolecular interactionsbetween the molecules of each compound:
1.Can the molecules form hydrogen bonds?
If the molecules have O /H11002H, N/H11002H, or
H/H11002F bonds, they can form hydrogen
bonds with themselves and with water. The diagram to the right illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules. If the molecules contain O, N, or F atoms that are notbonded
to hydrogen atoms, they may accept hydrogen bonds from water,even though they cannot form hydrogen bonds with themselves.
Molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with themselves have
a higher boiling point than similar molecules that cannot formhydrogen bonds with themselves . For example, alcohols can form
hydrogen bonds, but alkanes cannot. Therefore, alcohols havehigher boiling points than alkanes.
Molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with water, or can
accept hydrogen bonds from water, are usually soluble in water .
For example, many alcohols are soluble in water because they canform hydrogen bonds with water.
2.Are the molecules polar?
The molecules are polar if they have polar bonds, and if these
bonds do not act in opposite directions and counteract each other.Polar molecules are attracted to each other by dipole-dipole forces.
Polar molecules usually have a higher boiling point than
similar non-polar molecules. Also, polar molecules that can formhydrogen bonds have an even higher boiling point than polar molecules that cannot form hydrogen bonds . For example, ethanol,
CH
3CH2OH, is polar. Its molecules can form hydrogen bonds.
Methoxymethane, CH3OCH 3, is an isomer of ethanol. It is also
polar, but its molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds. Thus,ethanol has a higher boiling point than methoxymethane. Both ofthese compounds have a higher boiling point than the non-polarmolecule ethane, CH
3CH3.
Polar molecules with a large non-polar hydrocarbon part are
less polar than polar molecules with a smaller non-polar hydrocar-bon part . For example, octanol, CH
3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH,
is less polar than ethanol, CH3CH2OH.
Polar molecules with a large hydrocarbon part are less soluble
in water than polar molecules with a smaller hydrocarbon part .
For example, octanol, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH, is less
soluble in water than ethanol, CH3CH2OH.

24 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryIn the following ThoughtLab you will use the process in the box above to
predict and compare the physical properties of some organic compounds.3.How strong are the dispersion forces?
Dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces. They are stronger,
however, when the hydrocarbon part of a molecule is very large.Thus, a large molecule has stronger dispersion interactions than asmaller molecule.
A molecule with a greater number of carbon atoms usually has
a higher boiling point than the same type of molecule with fewercarbon atoms . For example, hexane, CH
3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3has a
higher boiling point than ethane, CH3CH3.
The melting points of organic compounds follow approximately
the same trend as their boiling points. There are some anomalies,however, due to more complex forces of bonding in solids.
Intermolecular forces affect the physical properties
of compounds. In this ThoughtLab, you will com-pare the intermolecular forces of different organiccompounds.

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 25Compounds With Single-Bonded Functional Groups
Alcohols, alkyl halides, ethers, and amines all have functional groups
with single bonds. These compounds have many interesting uses in daily life. As you learn how to identify and name these compounds, thinkabout how the intermolecular forces between their molecules affect theirproperties and uses.
Alcohols
An alcohol is an organic compound that contains the /H11002OH functional
group. Depending on the position of the hydroxyl group, an alcohol can be primary , secondary , or tertiary . Figure 1.13 gives some examples
of alcohols.

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 27Table 1.6 lists some common physical properties of alcohols. As
you learned earlier in this chapter, alcohols are polar molecules that experience hydrogen bonding. The physical properties of alcohols depend on these characteristics.
Table 1.6 Physical Properties of Alcohols
Additional Characteristics of Alcohols
•Alcohols are extremely ﬂammable, and should be treated with caution.
•Most alcohols are poisonous. Methanol can cause blindness or death
when consumed. Ethanol is consumed widely in moderate quantities,but it causes impairment and/or death when consumed in excess.Polarity of functional group
Hydrogen bonding
Solubility in water
Melting and boiling pointsThe O/H11002H bond is very polar. As the number of carbon
atoms in an alcohol becomes larger, the alkyl group ’s
non-polar nature becomes more important than the polar O
/H11002H bond. Therefore small alcohols are more polar
than alcohols with large hydrocarbon portions.
Alcohols experience hydrogen bonding with other
alcohol molecules and with water.
The capacity of alcohols for hydrogen bonding makes
them extremely soluble in water. Methanol and ethanol are miscible  (infinitely soluble) with water. The
solubility of an alcohol decreases as the number of carbon atoms increases.
Due to the strength of the hydrogen bonding, most
alcohols have higher melting and boiling points than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. Most alcohols are liquids at room temperature.15.Draw each alcohol.

An alkyl halide (also known as a haloalkane ) is an alkane in which one
or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with halogen atoms, such as F, Cl, Br, or I. The functional group of alkyl halides is R
/H11002X, where X
represents a halogen atom. Alkyl halides are similar in structure, polarity,and reactivity to alcohols. To name an alkyl halide, ﬁrst name the parent
hydrocarbon. Then use the pre ﬁx ﬂuoro-, chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-, with a
position number, to indicate the presence of a ﬂuorine atom, chlorine
atom, bromine atom, or iodine atom. The following Sample Problemshows how to name an alkyl halide.

The compound you have just made is called an ether. An ether is an
organic compound that has two alkyl groups joined by an oxygen atom.The general formula of an ether is R
/H11002O/H11002R. You can think of alcohols
and ethers as derivatives of the water molecule, as shown in Figure 1.14.Figure 1.15 gives two examples of ethers.
An alcohol is equivalent to a water molecule with one hydrogen atom
replaced by an alkyl group. Similarly, an ether is equivalent to a water molecule with both hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl groups.
Until fairly recently, ethoxyethane was widely used as an anaesthetic. It had
side effects, such as nausea, however. Compounds such as 1-methoxypropane are now usedinstead.

Amines
An organic compound with the functional group /H11002NH 2, /H11002NHR, or
/H11002NR2is called an amine . The letter N refers to the nitrogen atom. The
letter R refers to an alkyl group attached to the nitrogen. The general formula of an amine is R
/H11002NR′2. Amines can be thought of as derivatives
of the ammonia molecule, NH 3. They are classi ﬁed as primary , secondary ,
or tertiary , depending on how many alkyl groups are attached to the
nitrogen atom. Note that the meanings of “primary, ” “seconday, ” and
“tertiary ” are slightly different from their meanings for alcohols.
Figure 1.16 gives some examples of amines.
To name an amine, follow the steps below. The Sample Problem
illustrates how to use these steps to name a secondary amine.
How to Name an Amine
Step 1 Identify the largest hydrocarbon group attached to the nitrogen atom
as the parent alkane.
Step 2 Replace the -e at the end of the name of the parent alkane with the new ending -amine. Include a position number, if necessary, toshow the location of the functional group on the hydrocarbon chain.
Step 3 Name the other alkyl group(s) attached to the nitrogen atom. Insteadof position numbers, use the letter N- to locate the group(s). (If twoidentical alkyl groups are attached to the nitrogen atom, use N,N-.)This is the pre ﬁx.

two alkyl groups and one hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen.A tertiary amine has three alkyl
groups attached to the nitrogen atom.Polarity of functional group
Hydrogen bonding
Solubility in water
Melting and boiling pointsThe bent shape around the oxygen atom in an ether
means that the two C /H11002O dipoles do not counteract each
other. Because a C /H11002O bond is less polar than an O /H11002H
bond, an ether is less polar than an alcohol.
Because there is no O /H11002H bond in an ether, hydrogen
bonding does not occur between ether molecules. Ethers can accept hydrogen bonding from water molecules.
Ethers are usually soluble in water. The solubility of an
ether decreases as the size of the alkyl groups increases.
The boiling points of ethers are much lower than the
boiling points of alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms.

Additional Characteristics of Amines
•Amines are found widely in nature. They are often toxic. Many
amines that are produced by plants have medicinal properties. (See Figure 1.17.)
•Amines with low molecular masses have a distinctive ﬁshy smell.
Also, many offensive odours of decay and decomposition are caused by amines. For example, cadavarine, H
2NCH 2CH2CH2CH2CH2NH 2,
contributes to the odour of decaying ﬂesh. This compound gets its
common name from the word “cadaver, ” meaning “dead body. ”
•Like ammonia, amines act as weak bases. Since amines are bases,
adding an acid to an amine produces a salt. This explains why vinegar and lemon juice (both acids) can be used to neutralize the ﬁshy smell of seafood, which is caused by basic amines.

usually polar.
The presence of one or more N /H11002H bonds allows
hydrogen bonding to take place.
Because of hydrogen bonding, amines with low
molecular masses (four or less carbon atoms) are completely miscible with water. The solubility of an amine decreases as the number of carbon atoms increases.
The boiling points of primary and secondary amines
(which contain N
/H11002H bonds) are higher than the boiling
points of tertiary amines (which do not contain an N /H11002H
bond). The higher boiling points are due to hydrogen bonding between amine molecules.

With the C /H11005O Bond
Some of the most interesting and useful organic compounds belong to
families you are about to encounter. For example, the sweet taste of vanilla and the spicy scent of cinnamon have something in common: a carbonyl group. A carbonyl group is composed of a carbon atom double-
bonded to an oxygen atom. In this section, you will study the structuresand properties of organic compounds that have the C
/H11005O group.
Aldehydes and Ketones
Aldehydes and ketones both have the carbonyl functional group. An aldehyde is an organic compound that has a double-bonded oxygen on
the last carbon of a carbon chain. The functional group for an aldehyde is
The general formula for an aldehyde is R
/H11002CHO, where R is any alkyl
group. Figure 1.18 shows the ﬁrst two aldehydes.
Methanal is made from methanol. It is used to preserve animal tissues and
to manufacture plastics. Ethanal is also used as a preservative, and in the manufacture ofresins and dyes.
When the carbonyl group occurs within a hydrocarbon chain, the
compound is a ketone. A ketone is an organic compound that has a
double-bonded oxygen on any carbon within the carbon chain. The functional group of a ketone is
The general formula for a ketone is RCOR ′, where R and R ′are alkyl
groups. Figure 1.19 shows the simplest ketone, propanone.
Like the other organic compounds you have encountered, the names
of aldehydes and ketones are based on the names of the parent alkanes. To name an aldehyde, follow the steps below.
How to Name an Aldehyde
Step 1 Name the parent alkane. Always give the carbon atom of the
carbonyl group the position number 1.
Step 2 Replace the -e at the end of the name of the parent alkane with -al.The carbonyl group is always given position number 1. Therefore,you do not need to include a position number for it.
To name a ketone, follow the steps on the next page. The Sample Problem

•In general, aldehydes have a strong pungent smell, while ketones
smell sweet. Aldehydes with higher molecular masses have a pleasantsmell. For example, cinnamaldehyde gives cinnamon its spicy smell.(See Figure 1.20.) Aldehydes and ketones are often used to make perfumes. The rose ketones (shown in Figure 1.21) provide up to 90%of the characteristic rose odour. Perfumers mix organic compounds,such as the rose ketones, to obtain distinctive and attractive scents.
•Since aldehydes and ketones are polar, they can act as polar solvents.
Because of the non-polar hydrocarbon part of their molecules, aldehydesand ketones can also act as solvents for non-polar compounds. Forexample, 2-propanone (common name: acetone) is an important organicsolvent in the chemical industry.
•Table 1.10 compares the boiling points of an alkane, an alcohol, and an

Infrared Spectroscopy
How do researchers know when they have produced
or discovered a new compound? How do they analyze the structure of a molecule?
A technique called infrared (IR) spectroscopy
is valuable in the study of organic compounds. Thistechnique allows researchers to determine the kindsof bonds and functional groups that are present in a molecule. Using a more advanced analysis,researchers are even able to determine other groupsand bonds that are nearby. This information, pairedwith the molecular formula of a compound, helpsresearchers puzzle out the precise structure of anunknown molecule.
An infrared spectrometer works by shining
infrared light through a sample of a compound.Organic molecules absorb light at certain frequenciesin the range of 450 nm to 4000 nm. A sensor on theother side of the sample detects the amount of lightthat is absorbed by the sample at each wavelength.
When a molecule absorbs light at a certain
frequency, it means that a speci ﬁc bond is stretch-
ing, bending, or vibrating. The frequency whereeach bond absorbs light energy to stretch, bend, or vibrate is very speci ﬁc. The absorption results in
a decrease in intensity of the light transmitted, asmeasured by the sensor. This is how an infraredspectrum is formed for a molecule. The spectrum is
as speci ﬁc to a certain molecule as your ﬁngerprint
is to you. The table below shows some typical loca-tions for peaks on an infrared spectrum.
Table 1.11
The shape of the peak for each functional group isaffected by other groups and atoms in the vicinity.Examine the spectrum for 2-pentanone, shownbelow. This compound has many C
/H11002H bonds, and
one C/H11005O bond. The jagged peak in the range of 3.4
µm to 3.5 µm is caused by the various C /H11002H bonds
in the molecule absorbing light and stretching. Thepeak between 5.8
µm and 5.9 µm is caused by the
C/H11005O bond stretching. The peaks between 6.7 µm
and 7.7 µm represent the C /H11002H bonds bending.Bond or functional group Wavelength ( µm)

that carboxylic acids have even stronger hydrogen bonding than alcohols.

Polarity of functional group
Hydrogen bonding
Solubility in water
Melting and boiling pointsDue to the presence of the polar O /H11002H and C /H11005O bonds,
carboxylic acids are polar compounds.
The hydrogen bonding
between carboxylic acid molecules is strong, as shown here: Hydrogen bonding also occurs between carboxylic acid molecules and water molecules.
Carboxylic acids with low molecular masses are very
soluble in water. The first four simple carboxylic acids (methanoic acid, ethanoic acid, propanoic acid, and butanoic acid) are miscible with water.
Like alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes, the solubility
of  carboxylic acids in water decreases as the number of carbon atoms increases.
Because of the strong hydrogen bonds between
molecules, the melting and boiling points of carboxylic acids are very high.HO

Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 41Additional Characteristics of Carboxylic Acids
•Carboxylic acids often have unpleasant odours. For example, butanoic
acid has the odour of stale sweat.
•The /H11002OH group in a carboxylic acid does notbehave like the basic
hydroxide ion, OH−. Oxygen has a high electronegativity (attraction
to electrons) and there are two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acidfunctional group. These electronegative oxygen atoms help to carry theextra negative charge that is caused when a positive hydrogen atom dissociates. This is why the hydrogen atom in a carboxylic acid is ableto dissociate, and the carboxylic acid behaves like an acid.
•Figure 1.25 compares the melting and boiling points of a carboxylic
acid with the melting and boiling points of other organic compounds.As you can see, the melting and boiling points of the carboxylic acid are much higher than the melting and boiling points of the other compounds. This is due to the exceptionally strong hydrogen bondingbetween carboxylic acid molecules.
Derivatives of Carboxylic Acids
Exchanging the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid with a different group
produces a carboxylic acid derivative . In the following investigation, you

44 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryCarboxylic Acid Derivatives
The strong-smelling compounds you prepared in Investigation 1-A do not
ﬁt into any of the organic families you have studied so far. According to
their molecular formulas, however, they are isomers of carboxylic acids.They are esters. Because an ester is obtained by replacing the
/H11002OH
group of a carboxylic acid with a different group, it is called a derivative
of a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have several important derivatives.In this section, you will study two of these derivatives: esters and amides.
Esters
An ester is an organic compound that has the following functional group:
The general formula for an ester is RCOOR ′, where R is a hydrogen atom
or a hydrocarbon, and R ′is a hydrocarbon. You can think of an ester as
the product of a reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, asshown in Figure 1.26.
When heated, butanoic acid reacts with ethanol to produce an ester called
ethyl butanoate.
To name an ester, you must recognize that an ester can be thought of as
having two distinct parts. The main part of the ester contains the /H11002COO
group. This part comes from the parent acid. When numbering the mainchain of a carboxylic acid, the carbon atom in the carboxyl group is alwaysgiven position number 1. The second part of an ester is the alkyl group.
To name an ester, follow the steps below.
How to Name an Ester
Step 1 Identify the main part of the ester, which contains the C /H11005O group.
This part comes from the parent acid. Begin by naming the parentacid.
Step 2 Replace the - oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with
-oate.
Step 3 The second part of an ester is the alkyl group that is attached to theoxygen atom. Name this as you would name any other alkyl group.
Step 4 Put the two names together. Note that esters are named as twowords. (See Figure 1.27.)
The main part of this molecule is based on butanoic acid. The other part of the
ester is an ethyl group. The full name is ethyl -+-butanoate →ethyl butanoateFigure 1.27parent acid alkyl groupO

of esters. As you will see, esters have different physical properties thancarboxylic acids, even though esters and carboxylic acids are isomers ofeach other.

Additional Characteristics of Esters
•Esters often have pleasant odours and tastes, so they are used to
produce perfumes and arti ﬁcial ﬂavours. In fact, the characteristic tastes
and smells of many fruits come from esters. (See Figure 1.28.)
Amides
An ester can be thought of as the combination of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Similarly, you can think of an amide as the combination of a carboxylic acid and ammonia or an amine. An amide is an organic
compound that has a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom andsingle-bonded to a nitrogen atom.
Amides have the functional group below:
The general formula for an amide is R
/H11002CO/H11002NR2. R can stand for a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group. Figure 1.29 gives some examples of amides.
Examples of amides

Hydrogen bondingSolubility in water
Melting and boiling pointsLike carboxylic acids, esters are usually polar molecules.
Esters do not have an O /H11002H bond. Therefore, they cannot
form hydrogen bonds with other ester molecules.
Esters can accept hydrogen bonds from water. Therefore,
esters with very low molecular masses are soluble in water. Esters with carbon chains that are longer than three or four carbons are not soluble in water.
Because esters cannot form hydrogen bonds, they have
low boiling points. They are usually volatile liquids at room temperature.
Chapter 1  Classifying Organic Compounds • MHR 47How to Name an Amide
Step 1 Locate the part of the amide that contains the C /H11005O group. Name
the parent carboxylic acid that this part derives from. Note: The
carbon in the C /H11005O group is always given position number 1.
Step 2 Replace the - oic acid ending of the name of the parent acid with the
sufﬁx -amide.
Step 3 Decide whether the compound is a primary, secondary, or tertiary
amide:
•If there are two hydrogen atoms (and no alkyl groups) attached
to the nitrogen atom, the compound is a primary amide and
needs no other pre ﬁxes.
•If there is one alkyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, the
compound is a secondary amide . Name the alkyl group, and
give it location letter N- to indicate that it is bonded to the nitrogen atom.
•If there are two alkyl groups, the compound is a tertiary amide .
Place the alkyl groups in alphabetical order. Use location letterN- before each group to indicate that it is bonded to the nitrogenatom. If the two groups are identical, use N,N-.
Step 4 Put the name together: pre ﬁx +root +sufﬁx.
Problem
Name the following compound.
Solution
Step 1 The parent acid is 2-methylpropanoic acid.
Step 2 The base name for this compound is 2-methylpropanamide.
(The root is -propan-, and the suf ﬁx is -amide.)
Step 3 A propyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. Thus, the
compound ’s pre ﬁx is N-propyl-.

Additional Characteristics of Amides
•An amide called acetaminophen is a main component of many
painkillers.
•Urea, another common example of an amide, is made from the reaction
between carbon dioxide gas, CO2, and ammonia, NH 3. Urea was the ﬁrst
organic compound to be synthesized in a laboratory. It is found in theurine of many mammals, including humans, and it is used as a fertilizer.
Comparing Physical Properties
In this chapter, you have learned how to recognize many different types of organic compounds. In the ﬁrst section, you learned how to use polar
bonds and the shape of a molecule to determine its molecular polarity.The following investigation allows you to apply what you have learned to predict and compare the physical properties of various organic compounds.Polarity of functional group
Hydrogen bonding
Solubility in water
Melting and boiling pointsBecause the nitrogen atom attracts electrons more
strongly than carbon or hydrogen atoms, the C /H11002N and
N/H11002H bonds are polar. As a result, the physical
properties of amides are similar to the physical properties of carboxylic acids.
Because primary amides have two N /H11002H bonds, they have
even stronger hydrogen bonds than carboxylic acids. Secondary amides also experience hydrogen bonding.
Amides are soluble in water. Their solubility decreases
as the non-polar hydrocarbon part of the molecule increases in size.
Primary amides have much higher melting and boiling
points than carboxylic acids. Many simple amides are solid at room temperature.43.Name each amide.

10-deacetylbaccatin III
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. It is a disease in
which cells mutate and grow at uncontrolled rates, disrupting the body’snormal functions. TAXOL , shown at the bottom of the page, is an organic
compound that is found in the bark of the Paciﬁc yew tree. After many testsand reviews, TAXOL was approved for use in treating ovarian cancer.
The bark of a large yew tree yields only enough TAXOL for a single
treatment. However, cancer patients require repeated treatments over along period of time. Working in a laboratory, chemists found the ﬁrst solution to this problem. They developed several different methods tomake, or synthesize , TAXOL , from simple, widely available chemicals.
Unfortunately, these methods are expensive and time-consuming.
When studying the Paciﬁc yew’s close relative, the European yew,
chemists made an exciting discovery that led to the second solution. The needles and twigs of the European yew contain 10-deacetylbaccatinIII, shown at the bottom of the page. A few reaction steps can transform10-deacetylbaccatin III into TAXOL .Instead of destroying an entire
Paciﬁc yew tree for a single treatment of TAXOL , scientists can now
use the needles from a European yew. The parent tree is not harmed.
As you have already learned, the study of organic chemistry is really
the study of functional groups. Each functional group undergoes speciﬁc,predictable reactions. Chemists used their knowledge of functional groupsto design the reactions that convert 10-deacetylbaccatin III into TAXOL .
In this chapter, you will learn how to predict the products of variousorganic reactions, such as addition, substitution, and elimination reactions.

Figure 2.1(A) shows raw fruit. The crisp, sharp-tasting fruit becomes soft
and sweet when it is cooked. Figure 2.1(B) shows a chemist acceleratingthe tranformation of ethanol into ethanoic acid, by adding potassiumdichromate and sulfuric acid.
What do these reactions have in common? They are both examples of
organic reactions. In this section, you will take a quick look at the maintypes of organic reactions. You will concentrate on simply recognizingthese types of organic reactions. In the next section, you will examine thereactions of speciﬁc functional groups and learn how to predict the prod-ucts of organic reactions.
Organic reactions take place all around you, not only in a science lab.
Addition, Substitution, and Elimination Reactions
Addition reactions, substitution reactions, and elimination reactions arethe three main types of organic reactions. Most organic reactions can beclassiﬁed as one of these three types.
Addition Reactions
In an addition reaction , atoms are added to a double or triple bond. One
bond of the multiple bond breaks so that two new bonds can form. To recognize an addition reaction, remember that twocompounds usually
react to form onemajor product. (Sometimes two isomers are formed.)
The product has more atoms bonded to carbon atoms than the organicreactant did. A general example of addition to an alkene is given below.
Addition reactions are common for alkenes and alkynes. Addition
reactions can also occur at a C
/H11005O bond. Some examples of addition
reactions are shown on the next page.CH CH CH CH → +XYXYFigure 2.1
Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 57
A B
58 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistrySubstitution Reactions
In a substitution reaction , a hydrogen atom or a functional group is
replaced by a different functional group. To help you recognize this type of reaction, remember that twocompounds usually react to form
twodifferent products. The organic reactant(s) and the organic product(s)
have the same number of atoms bonded to carbon.
Alcohols, alkyl halides, and aromatic compounds commonly undergo
substitution reactions, as shown in these examples.

Example 2Example 1
You can express an addition
reaction algebraically, usingthe equation a+b→ab.
Come up with similar equations for substitution and elimination reactions.
Elimination Reactions
In an elimination reaction , atoms are removed from a molecule to form a
double bond. This type of reaction is the reverse of an addition reaction.One reactant usually breaks up to give two products. The organic product
typically has fewer atoms bonded to carbon atoms than the organic reactant did.
Alcohols often undergo elimination reactions when they are heated in
the presence of strong acids, such as sulfuric acid, H
2SO4, which acts
as a catalyst. (See the ﬁrst example below.) Alkyl halides also undergo
elimination reactions to produce alkenes. (See the second example.)
Oxidation and Reduction
An important type of organic reaction occurs when there is a change inthe number of hydrogen or oxygen atoms that are bonded to carbon. InUnit 5, you will take a close look at oxidation-reduction reactions in termsof the transfer of electrons. As you will learn, oxidation and reductionalways occur together. One reactant is oxidized while the other reactant is reduced. In this unit, however, you will focus on the organic reactantonly. Therefore, you will deal with oxidation and reduction separately, asthey apply to organic compounds. In organic chemistry, oxidation andreduction are de ﬁned by the changes of the bonds to carbon atoms in the
organic reactant. H OHH

In the ﬁrst example of an

speeds up a reaction but is notconsumed by it.
Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 59
60 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryOxidation
In organic chemistry, oxidation is de ﬁned as a reaction in which a carbon
atom forms more bonds to oxygen, O, or less bonds to hydrogen, H. Anoxidation that involves the formation of double C
/H11005O bonds may also be
classi ﬁed as an elimination reaction.
For example, alcohols can be oxidized to produce aldehydes and
ketones. Oxidation occurs when an organic compound reacts with an oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents include acidi ﬁed potassium
permanganate, KMnO
4, acidi ﬁed potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, and
ozone, O3. The symbol [O] is used to symbolize an oxidizing agent, as
shown below. Note that equations for the oxidation of organic compoundsare often left unbalanced. The purpose of the equation is to show thechanges in the organic reactant only.
To identify an oxidation, count and compare the number of C
/H11002H
and C/H11002O bonds in both the reactant and product. Try it for the
following example.
Reduction
In organic chemistry, reduction is de ﬁned as a reaction in which a
carbon atom forms fewer bonds to oxygen, O, or more bonds to hydrogen,H. Often, a C
/H11005O bond or C /H11005C bond is reduced to a single bond by
reduction. A reduction that transforms double C /H11005C or C /H11005O bonds to
single bonds may also be classi ﬁed as an addition reaction. Aldehydes,
ketones, and carboxylic acids can be reduced to become alcohols. Alkenesand alkynes can be reduced by the addition of H
2to become alkanes.
Reduction occurs when an organic compound reacts with a reducing
agent. Common reducing agents are lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH 4,
and hydrogen gas over a platinum catalyst, H2/Pt. The symbol [H] is used
to symbolize a reducing agent. As is the case for oxidation, equationsshowing the reduction of organic compounds are often left unbalanced. OH H

To identify a reduction, count and compare the number of C /H11002H and
C/H11002O bonds in both the reactant and the product. Try it for the following
example.
Other Important Organic Reactions
In this chapter, you will also encounter the following classes of organicreactions: condensation reactions and hydrolysis reactions. Condensationand hydrolysis reactions are both types of substitution reactions.
Condensation Reactions
In a condensation reaction , two organic molecules combine to form a
single organic molecule. A small molecule, usually water, is producedduring the reaction. For example, a carboxylic acid and an alcohol cancondense to form an ester.
Hydrolysis Reactions
In a hydrolysis reaction , water adds to a bond, splitting it in two. This
reaction is the reverse of a condensation reaction. For example, water can add to an ester or amide bond. A carboxylic acid and an alcohol areproduced if an ester bond is hydrolyzed, as shown in the example below. A carboxylic acid and an amine are produced if an amide bond is hydrolyzed.

organic reactions.

Solution
(a)Count the number of C /H11002H bonds and C /H11002O bonds in the reactant
and in the product.
Reactant: 8 C /H11002H bonds, 2 C /H11002O bonds (or 1 C /H11005O bond)
Product: 9 C /H11002H bonds, 1 C /H11002O bond
The product has gained a C/H11002H bond and losta C/H11002O bond. Thus,
this is a reduction.
(b)Count the number of C /H11002H bonds and C /H11002O bonds in the reactant
and in the product. Although the C /H11002H bonds are not shown, you
know that a carbon atom forms a total of four bonds.
Reactant: 11 C /H11002H bonds, 1 C /H11002O bond
Product: 10 C /H11002H bonds, 2 C /H11002O bonds (or 1 C /H11005O bond)
The product has losta C/H11002H bond and gained a C/H11002O bond.

Specific Expectations  2.2Reactions of Functional Groups
In the past, mirrors were rare and valuable, made from sheets of polished
copper or silver. Although they were expensive, they usually producedonly warped and dim images. Modern mirrors are everywhere. They arecheaply made of glass, with a very thin layer of silver over the back of theglass. Because the surface of the glass and the layer of silver are sosmooth, the image is almost perfect. One method for depositing a thinlayer of silver over glass is shown in Figure 2.2.
The “silver mirror test” is used to distinguish an aldehyde from a ketone.
Tollen’s reagent, Ag(NH 3)2OH, acts as an oxidizing agent. When it is mixed with an aldehyde,
the aldehyde oxidizes to the salt of a carboxylic acid. The silver ions in Tollen’s reagent arereduced to silver atoms, and coat the glass of the reaction container with solid silver metal.
In this section, you will learn how to predict the reactions of different
functional groups. You studied the most common reaction of alkanes,combustion, in your previous chemistry course. For this reason, the reactions of alkanes will not be considered here. The reactions of aminesand ethers will be left for a later chemistry course.
Reactions of Alkenes and Alkynes
Because alkenes and alkynes have reactive double or triple bonds, theyundergo addition reactions. Some common atoms and groups of atomsthat can be added to a double or triple bond include•H and OH (from H
2O)
•H and X (from HX), where X=Cl, Br, or I
•X and X (from X2), where X=Cl, Br, or I
•H and H (from H2)
Depending on which atoms are added to the multiple bond, the product
may be an alcohol, alkyl halide, alkane, or alkene (if atoms are added to atriple bond).Figure 2.2
Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 65
66 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryAddition to Alkenes
The product of an addition reaction depends on the symmetry of the
reactants. A symmetrical alkene has identical groups on either side of the
double bond. Ethene, CH2/H11005CH2, is an example of a symmetrical alkene.
An alkene that has different groups on either side of the double bond iscalled an asymmetrical alkene . Propene, CH
3CH/H11005CH2, is an example of
an asymmetrical alkene.
The molecules that are added to a multiple bond can also be classi ﬁed
as symmetrical or asymmetrical. For example, chlorine, Cl2, breaks into
two identical parts when it adds to a multiple bond. Therefore, it is a symmetrical reactant. Water, HOH, breaks into two different groups (H andOH) when it adds to a multiple bond, so it is an asymmetrical reactant.
In Figures 2.3 and 2.4, at least one of the reactants is symmetrical.
When one or more reactants in an addition reaction are symmetrical, onlyone product is possible.
The addition of water to 2-butene
The addition of chlorine to 1-butene
When both reactants are asymmetrical, however, more than one product
is possible. This is shown in Figure 2.5. The two possible products areisomers of each other.
The addition of hydrobromic acid to 1-butene
Although both products are possible, 2-bromobutane is the observed product. This observation is explained by Markovnikov ’s rule.
Markovnikov’s rule states that the halogen atom or OH group in an addition
reaction is usually added to the more substituted carbon atom—the carbonatom that is bonded to the largest number of other carbon atoms . Think of
the phrase “the rich get richer. ” The carbon with the most hydrogen atoms
receives even more hydrogen atoms in an addition reaction. According to Markovnikov ’s rule, the addition of two asymmetrical reactants forms
primarily one product. Only a small amount of the other isomer is formed.The following Sample Problem shows how to use Markovnikov ’s rule to
predict the products of addition reactions.Figure 2.5CHCH 2CH3 H2C CHCH 2CH3 CHCH 2CH3 H2C → ++

Solution
According to Markovnikov ’s rule, the hydrogen atom will go to the
double-bonded carbon with the larger number of hydrogen atoms .
Thus, the chlorine atom will go to the other carbon, which has the largernumber of C

68 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryAddition to Alkynes
Since alkynes have triple bonds, two addition reactions can take place in
a row. If one mole of a reactant, such as HCl, Br2, or H2O, is added to one
mole of an alkyne, the result is a substituted alkene.
If two moles of the reactant are added to one mole of an alkyne, the
reaction continues one step further. A second addition reaction takesplace, producing an alkane.
Like alkenes, asymmetrical alkynes follow Markovnikov ’s rule when an
asymmetrical molecule, such as H
2Oor HBr, is added to the triple bond.

Addition reactions form the
basis for tests that distinguishalkenes and alkynes from alka-nes. Bromine, Br
2, has a deep
reddish-brown colour. Whenbromine is added to an alkeneor alkyne, an addition reactiontakes place. As the bromine isused up, the brown colour ofthe bromine disappears. Sincealkanes cannot undergo addi-tion reactions, no reactiontakes place when bromine isadded to an alkane.FACTCHEM

Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 69Canadians in Chemistry
Dusanka Filipovic
When Dusanka Filipovic was a teenager, she liked
hiking, playing volleyball, and working as a campcounsellor. Now she is a successful chemical engineer who develops and markets technology that helps the environment. What do her early pursuits have to do with her engineering career?“Both require creativity, persistence, and an ability
to work under pressure, ” says Filipovic.
Filipovic was born and grew up in Belgrade, in
the former Yugoslavia. She attended the Universityof Belgrade, and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. Attracted by Canada ’s
technical advances, she came here after winning a scholarship to study at McMaster University inHamilton, Ontario. Canada has become her home.
Filipovic has worked hard to break down barriers
for women in the ﬁelds of engineering and business.
In 1974, she became the ﬁrst female professional
engineer employed by a major chemical producingcompany. The National Museum of Science andTechnology in Ottawa, Ontario, has featured herwork as part of an exhibit on women inventors.
Since the 1980s, Filipovic has concentrated on
developing environmentally friendly technologies.She is the co-inventor of a patented process knownas Blue Bottle ™ technology. This process is used to recover and recycle halogenated hydrocarbons,
such as chloro ﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) and other
ozone-depleting substances (ODS), from damagedor unused residential refrigerators and automotiveair conditioners.
Using adsorption , the binding of molecules or
particles to a surface, Blue Bottle
TMtechnology acts
as a selective molecular sieve to capture refrigerantgases so that they can be safely stored and re-used.A non-pressurized Blue Bottle
TMcylinder, packed
with an adsorbent, synthetic zeolite calledHalozite
TM, is connected to the back of a refrigera-
tion or air-conditioning unit. Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate minerals that commonly containsodium and calcium as major cations (positivelycharged ions) and are capable of ion exchange.(Zeolites contain water molecules that allowreversible dehydration, and they are often used as water softeners.) The Halozite
TMadsorbs the
refrigerants that are released from the unit at ambient temperatures, under atmospheric pressure.
Once the adsorbent is saturated, the Blue
Bottle
TMcylinder is sent to a central reclamation
facility, where the refrigerants are reclaimed andstored. The Blue Bottle
TMcylinders can be re-used
after the refrigerants have been collected. Reclaimed halogenated hydrocarbons can be usedas refrigerants, solvents, cleaners, fumigants, andﬁre retardants.
In 1991, Filipovic formed her own company to
commercialize Blue Bottle
TMtechnology. In 1999,
she founded a new company, which uses a processsimilar to Blue Bottle
TMtechnology to capture and
convert greenhouse gas emissions from hospitaloperating rooms. These emissions had previouslybeen discharged into the atmosphere.
Filipovic has this advice for aspiring engineers
and scientists: “Once you recognize what it is you
want to pursue, make sure you take advantage ofevery training opportunity offered to you. I becamean engineer because I wanted to be able to createsomething new, and monitor and enjoy the resultsof my work . . . I am working to make a signi ﬁcant
contribution that will live on after me. ”
Reactions of Aromatic Compounds
As you learned in Chapter 1, aromatic compounds do not react in the
same way that compounds with double or triple bonds do. Benzene ’s
stable ring does not usually accept the addition of other atoms. Instead,aromatic compounds undergo substitution reactions. A hydrogen atom or a functional group that is attached to the benzene ring may be replacedby a different functional group. Figure 2.6 shows two possible reactionsfor benzene. Notice that iron(III) bromide, FeBr
3, is used as a catalyst in
the substitution reaction. An addition reaction does notoccur because the
product of this reaction would be less stable than benzene.
The bromine does not add to benzene in an addition reaction. Instead, one of the
H atoms on the benzene ring is replaced with a Br atom in a substitution reaction.
Reactions of Alcohols
Alcohols can react in several ways, depending on the reactants and on the
conditions of the reaction. For example, alcohols can undergo substitutionwith halogen acids, elimination to form alkenes, and oxidation to formaldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids.
Substitution Reactions of Alcohols
When a halogen acid, such as HCl, HBr, or HI, reacts with an alcohol,
the halogen atom is substituted for the OH group of the alcohol. This isshown in Figure 2.7(A). The reverse reaction takes place when an alkylhalide reacts with OH
−in a basic solution. See Figure 2.7(B).
(A) Ethanol reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce chloroethane. (B) In a
basic solution, the reverse reaction takes place. A hydroxide ion reacts with chloroethane to produce ethanol.
Elimination Reactions of Alcohols
When an alcohol is heated in the presence of the strong acid and
dehydrating agent, H2SO4, an elimination reaction takes place. This type
of reaction is shown in Figure 2.8, on the next page. The OH group andone H atom leave the molecule, and water is produced. As a result, themolecule forms a double bond. Because water is produced, this type ofreaction is also called a dehydration (meaning “loss of water ”) reaction. Figure 2.7H2O CH3CH2OH   +   HCl   →   CH3CH2Cl+

The ∆symbol is used in chemistry to represent heat added to a reaction.
Oxidation of Alcohols
In the presence of an oxidizing agent, an alcohol is oxidized to form an
aldehyde or a ketone.
•A primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde. If the aldehyde is
oxidized further, it becomes a carboxylic acid.
•A secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone. All the carbon bonding
sites are now occupied with bonds to carbon and oxygen, so no furtheroxidation is possible.
•A tertiary alcohol cannot be oxidized. Carbon can form up to four
bonds, but all possible bonding sites are already occupied. C
/H11002H bonds
can be broken by an oxidizing agent. On the carbon atom of a tertiaryalcohol, however, there is no hydrogen atom available to be removed.C
/H11002C bonds are too strong to be broken by an oxidizing agent.

Name each type of reaction. Then predict and name the products.
(a)
(b)(c)
Solution
(a)The reactant is a secondary alcohol, and an oxidizing agent is present.
Therefore, this must be oxidation. You know that a secondary alcoholis oxidized to a ketone. The ketone must have the same carbon-carbonbonds, and the same number of carbon atoms, as the reacting alcohol.Therefore, the ketone must be 2-butanone.
(b)This reaction takes place in the presence of heat and sulfuric acid,
H2SO4. It is an elimination reaction. The product is an alkene, with
the same number of carbon atoms as the reacting alcohol. Since thisreaction is an elimination reaction, a small molecule (in this case,water) must be eliminated as the second product. The organic product is propene.
(c)In this reaction, an alcohol reacts with hydrobromic acid, HBr. This isa substitution reaction. The product is an alkyl halide, with the samecarbon-carbon bonds, and the same number of carbon atoms, as thereacting alcohol. The alkyl halide is 2-bromopropane. The secondproduct is water.

Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones
As you observed in the investigation, different alcohols react differently
with an oxidizing agent. In the same way, aldehydes and ketones react differently with oxidizing and reducing agents, even though aldehydesand ketones have similar structures.
Oxidation of Aldehydes
In the presence of an oxidizing agent, an aldehyde is oxidized to produce
a carboxylic acid. The hydrogen atom that is bonded to the carbon atom of the C
/H11005O bond is replaced with an OH group.
Ketones do not usually undergo oxidation. Like tertiary alcohols,
ketones do not have a hydrogen atom that is available to be removed.Carbon-carbon bonds are too strong to be broken by an oxidizing agent.
Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones
You learned earlier that primary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes, and
secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. You can think of the reduc-tion of aldehydes and ketones as the reverse of these reactions. Aldehydescan be reduced to produce primary alcohols. Ketones can be reduced toproduce secondary alcohols.

76 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryReactions of Carboxylic Acids
Like other acids, a carboxylic acid reacts with a base to produce a salt
and water.
As you learned earlier, a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to produce
an ester. Water is the second product of this reaction. A strong acid, suchas H
2SO4, is used to catalyze (speed up) the reaction. The reverse reaction
can also occur. (See “Reactions of Esters and Amides, ” below.)
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol to form an ester is
called an esteriﬁcation reaction . An esteri ﬁcation reaction is one type of
condensation reaction. In a similar type of condensation reaction, anamide can be formed from a carboxylic acid and an amine, but thisprocess is slightly longer and will not be discussed here.
Carboxylic acids can be reduced to form aldehydes and alcohols.
Reactions of Esters and Amides
Both esters and amides undergo hydrolysis reactions. In a hydrolysis reaction, the ester or amide bond is cleaved , or split in two, to form two
products. As mentioned earlier, the hydrolysis of an ester produces a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. The hydrolysis of an amide produces a carboxylic acid and an amine. There are two methods of hydrolysis: acidichydrolysis and basic hydrolysis. Both methods are shown in Figure 2.9.Hydrolysis usually requires heat. In acidic hydrolysis, the ester or amidereacts with water in the presence of an acid, such as H
2SO4. In basic
hydrolysis, the ester or amide reacts with the OH−ion, from NaOH or
water, in the presence of a base. Soap is made by the basic hydrolysis ofester bonds in vegetable oils or animal fats.
(A) The acid hydrolysis of an amide produces a carboxylic acid and an amine.

Specific Expectations  2.3Molecules on a Larger Scale:
Polymers and Biomolecules
Try to imagine a day without plastics. From simple plastic bags to furni-
ture and computer equipment, plastics are an intergral part of our homes,schools, and work places. So far in this unit, you have encountered fairlysmall organic molecules. Many of the organic molecules that are usedindustrially, such as plastics, and many of the essential molecules in yourbody, are much larger in size.
A polymer is a very long molecule that is made by linking together
many smaller molecules called monomers . To picture a polymer, imagine
taking a handful of paper clips and joining them into a long chain. Eachpaper clip represents a monomer. The long chain of repeating paper clipsrepresents a polymer. Many polymers are made of just one type ofmonomer. Other polymers are made from a combination of two or moredifferent monomers. Figure 2.10 shows an example of joined monomers ina polymer structure.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the plastic that is used to make
soft drink bottles.
Polymers that can be heated and moulded into speci ﬁc shapes and forms
are commonly known as plastics . All plastics are synthetic (arti ﬁcially
made) polymers. For example, polyethene is a common synthetic polymerthat is used to make plastic bags. Ethene, CH
2/H11005CH2, is the monomer for
polyethene. Adhesives, rubber, chewing gum, and Styrofoam ™ are other
important materials that are made from synthetic polymers.
Natural polymers are found in living things. For example, glucose,
C6H12O6, is the monomer for the natural polymer starch. You will learn
more about natural polymers later in this section.
Some polymers, both synthetic and natural, can be spun into long,
thin ﬁbres. These ﬁbres are woven into natural fabrics (such as cotton,
linen, and wool) or synthetic fabrics (such as rayon, nylon, and polyester).Figure 2.11, on the next page, shows some polymer products.Figure 2.10one unit, or

Making Synthetic Polymers:
Addition and Condensation Polymerization
Synthetic polymers are extremely useful and valuable. Many polymers
and their manufacturing processes have been patented as corporate technology. Polymers form by two of the reactions you have alreadylearned: addition reactions and condensation reactions.
The name of a polymer is usually written with the pre ﬁx poly-
(meaning “many ”) before the name of the monomer. Often the common
name of the monomer is used, rather than the IUPAC name. For example,the common name of ethene is ethylene. Polyethene, the polymer that is made from ethene, is often called polyethylene. Similarly, the polymer that is made from chloroethene (common name: vinyl chloride) is named polyvinylchloride (PVC). The polymer that is madefrom propene monomers (common name: propylene) is commonly calledpolypropylene, instead of polypropene.
Addition polymerization is a reaction in which monomers with
double bonds are joined together through multiple addition reactions to form a polymer. Figure 2.12 illustrates the addition polymerizationreaction of ethene to form polyethene. Table 2.1, on the next page, givesthe names, structures, and uses of some common polymers that areformed by addition polymerization.

Table 2.1 Examples of Addition Polymers
Condensation polymerization is a reaction in which monomers are joined
together by the formation of ester or amide bonds. A second smaller product, usually water, is produced by this reaction. For condensationpolymerization to occur, each monomer must have two functional groups(usually one at each end of the molecule).
Nylon-66 is made by the condensation polymerization of the
dicarboxylic acid adipic acid, and 1,6-diaminohexane, an amine. (Thenumber 66 comes from the fact that each of the two reactants contains sixcarbon atoms.) This reaction results in the formation of amide bondsbetween monomers, as shown in Figure 2.13. Condensation polymers that contain amide bonds are called nylons or polyamides . Condensation
polymers that contain ester bonds are called polyesters . Polyesters result
from the esteri ﬁcation of diacids and dialcohols.
Nylon-66 is made from adipic acid and 1,6-diaminohexane. Figure 2.13HO OH C N H HH O

Tetra ﬂuoroethene polymerizes to form the slippery polymer that is
commonly known as Te ﬂon™. Teﬂon™ is used as a non-stick coating
in frying pans, among other uses. Classify the following polymerizationreaction, and name the product. (The letter nindicates that many
monomers are involved in the reaction.)
Solution
The monomer reactant of this polymerization reaction contains a doublebond. The product polymer has no double bond, so an addition reactionmust have occurred. Thus, this reaction is an addition polymerizationreaction. Since the monomer ’s name is tetra ﬂuoroethene, the product ’s

In this investigation, you will examine three
different polymers. First, you will examine theaddition polymer sodium polyacrylate. Thispolymer contains sodium ions trapped inside the three-dimensional structure of the polymer.When placed in distilled water, the concentrationof sodium ions inside the polymer is muchgreater than the concentration of sodium ions outside the polymer. The concentrationimbalance causes water molecules to move by diffusion into the polymer. As a result, thepolymer absorbs many times its own mass in distilled water.
You will also examine polyvinyl alcohol, another
addition polymer. Polyvinyl alcohol is made bythe polymerization of hydroxyethene, alsoknown as vinyl alcohol.
Using an aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol,
you will prepare a cross-linked polymer, commonly known as “Slime. ”

88 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryRisks of the Polymer Industry
In the 1970s, workers at an American plastics manufacturing plant
began to experience serious illnesses. Several workers died of liver cancer before the problem was traced to its source: prolonged exposure to vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride (or chloroethene, C
2H3Cl) is used to
make polyvinylchloride (PVC). Unfortunately, vinyl chloride is a powerful carcinogen. Government regulations have now restricted workers ’ exposure to vinyl chloride. Trace amounts of this dangerous
chemical are still present, however, as pollution in the environment.
The manufacture and disposal of PVC creates another serious
problem. Dioxin, shown in Figure 2.14, is a highly toxic chemical. It isproduced during the manufacture and burning of PVC plastics.
Dioxin has been shown to be extremely carcinogenic to some animals. As
well, it is suspected of disrupting hormone activity in the body, leading to reduced fertilityand birth defects.
Many synthetic polymers, including most plastics, do not degrade in the
environment. What can be done with plastic and other polymer waste?One solution may be the development and use of degradable plastics .
These are polymers that break down over time when exposed to environmental conditions, such as light and bacteria. The ChemistryBulletin on the next page gives more information about degradable plastics.
Natural Polymers
Much of our technology has been developed by observing and imitatingthe natural world. Synthetic polymers, such as those you just encoun-tered, were developed by imitating natural polymers. For example, thenatural polymer cellulose provides most of the structure of plants. Wood,
paper, cotton, and ﬂax, are all composed of cellulose ﬁbres. Figure 2.15
shows part of a cellulose polymer.
Like other polymers, cellulose is made of repeating units. It is the main
structural ﬁbre in plants, and it makes up the ﬁbre in your diet.
Biochemistry is the study of the organic compounds and reactions
that occur in living things. Proteins, starches, and nucleic acids are important biological polymers. Some biological monomers, like aminoacids and sugars, are biologically important all on their own. You willalso encounter lipids, a class of large biological molecules that are not polymers.

Degradable Plastics:
Garbage That Takes Itself Out
Did you know that the ﬁrst plastics were consid-
ered too valuable to be thrown out? Today, manyplastics are considered disposable. Plastics nowtake up nearly one third of all land ﬁll space, and
society ’s use of plastics is on the rise. Recycling
initiatives are helping to reduce plastic waste.Another solution to this problem may involve thetechnology of degradable plastics.
All plastics are polymers, long molecules
made of repeating units. Because polymers are extremely stable, they resist reaction. Mostconventional plastics require hundreds or eventhousands of years to break down.
Degradable plastics are an important step
forward in technology. These new plastics canbreak down in a relatively short time —within six
months to a year. There are two main kinds ofdegradable plastics: biodegradable plastics andphotodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastics
are susceptible to decay processes that are similarto the decay processes of natural objects, such asplants. Photodegradable plastics disintegrate when
they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light.
The ability of a degradable plastic to decay
depends on the structure of its polymer chain.Biodegradable plastics are often manufacturedfrom natural polymers, such as cornstarch andwheat gluten. Micro-organisms in the soil canbreak down these natural polymers. Ideally, a biodegradable plastic would break down com-pletely into carbon dioxide, water, and biomasswithin six months, just like a natural material.
Photodegradable plastic is a Canadian
contribution to the environmental health of theplanet. It was developed in Canada more than 25years ago by Dr. James Guillet, of the University ofToronto. This plastic incorporates light-absorbing,or chromomorphic , molecular groups as part of its
backbone chain. The chromomorphic groupschange their structure when they are exposed toparticular frequencies of light (usually ultraviolet).The structural changes in these groups cause the backbone to break apart. Although the photodegradable process is not very effective at the bottom of a land ﬁll, it is ideally suited to
the marine environment. Plastics that are discardedin oceans and lakes usually ﬂoat at the surface,
and thus are exposed to light. The rings that are used to package canned drinks can stranglemarine wildlife. These rings are now made withphotodegradable technology in many countries.
Several nations are conducting further research
into other marine uses for this technology.
Making Connections
1.When a degradable plastic decays, the starch or
cellulose backbone may break down completelyinto carbon dioxide, water, and organic matter.What do you think happens to F, Cl, or otherheteroatom groups on the polymer chain as the backbone decays? Why might this be aproblem?
2.Several notable scientists have cautioned
against the use of biodegradable and photo-degradable plastics in land ﬁlls. The bottom
of a land ﬁll has no light, or oxygen for the
metabolism of bacteria. Why is this a problem?What changes must be made to land ﬁll design,
if biodegradable and photodegradable plasticsare going to be included in land ﬁlls?
3.Do degradable plastics disappear as soon as
they are discarded? What are the dangers of public con ﬁdence in the degradability of
plastics?

Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 89
90 MHR • Unit 1  Organic ChemistryAmino Acids and Proteins
A protein is a natural polymer that is composed of monomers called
amino acids . Proteins are found in meat, milk, eggs, and legumes.
Wool, leather, and silk are natural materials that are made of proteins.Your ﬁngernails, hair, and skin are composed of different proteins.
Proteins carry out many important functions in your body, such as speeding up chemical reactions (enzymes), transporting oxygen in yourblood (hemoglobin), and regulating your body responses (hormones).
There are 20 common amino acids in the human body. All amino
acids contain a carboxylic acid group and an amino group. Amino acidscan be linked by amide bonds to form proteins. Each amino acid has a different side chain, which is attached to the centre carbon atom. Figure2.16, below, shows the structure of an amino acid. The letter G representsthe side chain of the amino acid. Examples of side chains include
/H11002CH3
(for the amino acid alanine), /H11002CH2CH2CONH 2(for glutamine), and
/H11002CH2OH(for serine).
The structure of an amino acid
The shape and biological function of a protein depends on its sequence of
amino acids. A typical protein, such as insulin, contains at least 50 aminoacid groups. Depending on the sequence of these amino acids, an in ﬁnite
number of different proteins are possible. Each species of animal has itsown distinct proteins. The DNA in your body contains the blueprints formaking speci ﬁc proteins for your body ’s structure and function.
Carbohydrates
A carbohydrate (also called a saccharide ) is a biological molecule that
contains either an aldehyde or ketone group, along with two or morehydroxyl groups. The C
/H11005O group at one end of a simple saccharide
reacts with an OH group at the other end to produce the most commonformation, a ring. Figure 2.17 shows the ring forms of some of the simplest carbohydrates.

Studies have shown that honey
has the same quick absorptionand long-lasting energy-bursteffect that many sports drinksdo. This is because honey ishigh in fructose, a simple fruitsugar that has been found tobe the best sugar for athletes.Unpasteurized honey also contains hydrogen peroxideand enzymes, which aid indigestion.LINK Biology
Glucose is the simplest carbohydrate. It is found in grapes
and corn syrup. Fructose gives fruit its sweet taste. A condensation reactionbetween glucose and fructose produces sucrose, commonly called tablesugar. Sucrose is found in sugar cane and sugar beets.Figure 2.17
Carbohydrates are found in foods such as bread, pasta, potatoes, and
fruits. They are the primary source of energy for the body. In a processcalled cellular respiration , carbohydrates combine with inhaled oxygen
and are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, plus energy. Asshown in Figure 2.18, carbon dioxide and water vapour from cellular respiration are expelled in your breath.
On a cold day, the water vapour in your breath condenses on contact
with the air, forming a visible cloud.
A monosaccharide is composed of one saccharide unit. Thus, it is the
smallest molecule possible for a carbohydrate. A monosaccharide is oftencalled a simple carbohydrate, or simple sugar. Glucose, seen in Figure 2.17,on the previous page, is one example of a monosaccharide. Other mono-saccharides include fructose, galactose, and mannose.
Sucrose (shown in Figure 2.17) is a disaccharide , containing two
saccharide monomers. To produce a disaccharide, an
/H11002OH group on
one monomer reacts with an /H11002OH group on another monomer to form
an ether /H11002O/H11002linkage (also shown in Figure 2.17). This reaction is a
condensation, because two molecules combine and produce a molecule of water. During digestion, carbohydrates undergo hydrolysis reactions,which break the ether bonds between the monomers.
Polysaccharides are polymers that contain many saccharide units.
The most important polysaccharides are those in which glucose is themonomer. Plants use the glucose polysaccharide cellulose as a structural
material. (See Figure 2.15 for the structure of cellulose.) They store energy in the starches amylose and amylopectin . A starch is a glucose
polysaccharide that is used by plants to store energy. Humans can digeststarches. Animals store energy in the glucose polysaccharide glycogen ,

Humans and cats both begin life as fertilized eggs, which look fairly
similar. Why does a fertilized cat egg develop into a kitten, while a fertilized human egg develops into a child (Figure 2.20)? A very specialtype of polymer, located in the cell nucleus, directs the formation of theproteins from which an organism develops.
DNA in the cells of your body direct the production of proteins. Since your
bones, muscles, and organs are built from proteins that are speci ﬁc to humans, your body
is different from the body of a cat.
DNA (short for 2-deoxyribonucleic acid ) is the biological molecule that
determines the shape and structure of all organisms. It is found mostly in the nuclei of cells. Each strand of DNA is a polymer that is composedof repeating units, called nucleotides . A single strand of DNA may have
more than one million nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of threeparts: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a base.
DNA is one type of nucleic acid. The other type of nucleic acid is
called RNA (short for ribonucleic acid ). RNA is present throughout a cell.
It works closely with DNA to produce the proteins in the body. Table 2.3,on the next page, shows the structures of RNA and DNA.Figure 2.20

These strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases on the nucleotide units, as shown in Figure 2.21.
DNA has two main functions in the body:•It replicates itself exactly whenever a cell divides. Thus, every cell in
an organism contains the same information.
•It contains codes that allow each type of protein that is needed by the
body to be made by the body ’s cells. RNA assists in this process.
Lipids
The last biological molecules that you will examine in this course are
not polymers. They are, however, very large in size. Lipids are de ﬁned
as biological molecules that are not soluble in water, but are soluble innon-polar solvents, such as benzene and hexanes.
From your previous studies of solubility, you might hypothesize
that lipid molecules must have large hydrocarbon parts, since they aresoluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Your hypothesis would be correct.Lipids contain large hydrocarbon chains, or other large hydrocarbon structures.
Several types of lipids may be familiar to you. Fats, oils, and some
waxes are examples of lipids. Fats are lipids that contain a glycerol
molecule, bonded by ester linkages to three long-chain carboxylic acids.Oils have the same structure as fats, but are classi ﬁed as being liquid at
room temperature, while fats are solids at room temperature. Waxes are
esters of long-chain alcohols and long-chain carboxylic acids.
Other lipids include steroids, such as cholesterol, and terpenes,
which are plant oils such as oil of turpentine, or oil of cedar. Figure 2.22shows the lipid glyceryl trioleate , which is present in olive oil.
Lipids carry out many important functions in the body. Their most
important function is the long-term storage of energy. One gram of fat con-tains two-and-a-quarter times more energy than a gram of carbohydrate orprotein. When an animal consumes more carbohydrates than are neededat the time, the body converts the excess carbohydrates to fat. Later, wheninsuf ﬁcient carbohydrates are available for energy, the body may break
down some of these fats to use for energy. Carbohydrates are still neededin your diet, however, for the proper functioning of your cells.HH

In addition to storing energy, lipids have other vital functions:
•Cell membranes are made of a double layer of phospholipids . These
are lipids that are polar at one end and non-polar at the other end.
•Lipids such as cholesterol and testosterone act as hormones to regulate
body functions. (Not all hormones are lipids. Some hormones are proteins. Other hormones are neither lipids nor proteins.)
•Several vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, and E) are lipids. These
vitamins are known as fat-soluble .
•The fatty tissues in your body are made from lipids. They act like
protective “packaging ” around fragile organs, such as the heart. They
insulate the body from excessive heat or cold, and they act as paddingto reduce impact from collisions.

Specific Expectations  2.4Organic Compounds and
Everyday Life
You are already aware that organic compounds are an inescapable part of
your daily life. As you know, much of your body is composed of organiccompounds. The food you eat is made from organic compounds, as are theclothes you wear. The fuel that heats your home and powers buses andcars is also organic. When you are sick or injured, you may use organiccompounds to ﬁght infection or to reduce pain and swelling. Modern
processed foods include many ﬂavourings and colourings —another use
of organic compounds. (See Figure 2.23.)
In Chapter 1, you learned about esters that are used as ﬂavourings. Not all
ﬂavourings belong to the ester family. Menthol is an organic compound that is found in the
mint plant. It is used as a ﬂavouring in many substances, including toothpaste, chewing gum,
and cough syrups. What functional group is present in menthol? How might you guess thisfrom the name?
In this section, you will examine the uses of some common organic
compounds. You will also carry out an analysis of some of the risks andbene ﬁts that are involved in making and using organic compounds.
Risk-Bene ﬁt Analysis
How can you make the most informed decision possible when analyzing
the risks or bene ﬁts of a product or issue? The following steps are one
way to carry out a risk-bene ﬁt analysis for the manufacture and use of an
organic compound.
Step 1 Identify possible risks and bene ﬁts of the organic product. Ask
questions such as these:
•What are the direct uses of this product? (For example, is it used
as a pharmaceutical drug for a speci ﬁc disease or condition? Is it
an insecticide for a speci ﬁc insect “pest”?)
•What are the indirect uses of this product? (For example, is it used
in the manufacture of a different organic or inorganic product?)
•What are the direct risks of making or using this product?
(For example, is the product an environmental pollutant, or doesit contain compounds that may be harmful to the environment?Can the workers who manufacture this product be harmed byexposure to it?)Figure 2.23CH3

menthol
Chapter 2  Reactions of Organic Compounds • MHR 97
98 MHR • Unit 1  Organic Chemistry•What are the indirect risks of making or using this product? (For
example, are harmful by-products produced in the manufacture of this product? How much energy does the manufacture of thisproduct require, and where does the energy come from? What, ifany, side effects does this product cause?)
Step 2 Research the answers to your questions from step 1. Ensure thatyour information comes from reliable sources. If there is controversyon the risks and bene ﬁts of the product, ﬁnd information that covers
both sides of the issue.
Step 3 Decide on your own point of view. In your opinion, are the bene ﬁts
greater than the risks? Do the risks outweigh the bene ﬁts?
Step 4 Consider possible alternatives that may lessen the risks. Ask
questions such as the following:
•Does a similar, less harmful, product exist?
•Is there a better way to manufacture or dispose of this product?
•What safety precautions can be taken to reduce the risks?

The next four tables outline common uses of various organic compounds,
as well as possible complications resulting from each use. TheThoughtLab that follows provides an opportunity for you to work withand extend the information in the tables. Of course, the compounds listedare only a few of the many useful organic compounds that are available tosociety.

Problem Solving With Organic Compounds
Many chemicals and products have been developed as solutions to health,
safety, and environmental problems. Sometimes, however, a solution toone problem can introduce a different problem. Read the three articles onthe next few pages. Then complete the ThoughtLab that follows.

At the beginning of the twentieth
century, refrigeration was a relatively new technology. Earlyrefrigerators depended on the use of toxic gases, such as ammonia and methyl chloride.Unfortunately, these gases some-times leaked from refrigerators,leading to fatal accidents. In 1928,a new, “miracle” compound wasdeveloped to replace these toxicgases. Dichlorodifluoromethane,commonly known as Freon
®, was a
safe, non-toxic alternative. Freon ®
and other chlorofluorocarbon compounds, commonly referred toas CFCs, were also used fornumerous other products andapplications. They were largelyresponsible for the development ofmany conveniences, such as air-conditioning, that we now take forgranted.
Today we know that CFCs
break up when they reach theozone layer, releasing chlorineatoms. The chlorine atoms destroyozone molecules faster than theozone can regenerate from oxygengas. Studies in the past ten yearshave shown dramatic drops inozone concentration at specificlocations. Since ozone protectsEarth from the Sun’s ultraviolet
radiation, this decrease in ozonehas led to increases in skin cancer,as well as damage to plants andanimals. In addition, CFCs arepotent greenhouse gases and con-tribute to global warming. Throughthe Montréal Protocol, and later“Earth Summit” gatherings, manycountries—including Canada—have banned CFC production.
Substitutes for CFCs are
available, but none provide a completely satisfactory alternative.Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) areorganic compounds that behavelike CFCs, but do not harm the ozone layer. For example,1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and 1,1-diﬂuoroethane are HFCs thatcan be used to replace CFCs inrefrigerators and air conditioners.Unfortunately, HFCs are alsogreenhouse gases.
Simple hydrocarbons can also
be used as CFC substitutes.Hydrocarbons such as propane,2-methylpropane (common name:isobutane), and butane are efﬁcientaerosol propellants. These hydro-carbons are stable and inexpensive,but they are extremely ﬂammable.

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
better known as DDT, is a well-known pesticide that has causedsigniﬁcant environmental damage.It is easy to point ﬁngers, blamingscientists and manufacturers forhaving “unleashed” this organiccompound on an unsuspectingworld. It is more difﬁcult, however,to understand why this environ-mental disaster took place.
Insects consume more than
one third of the world’s crops eachyear. In addition, insects such asmosquitoes spread life-threateningdiseases, including malaria andencephalitis. Weeds reduce cropyields by taking over space, usingup nutrients, and blocking sunlight.Some weeds even poison the animals that the crops are intendedto feed. Crop damage and low
crop yield are signiﬁcant problemsfor countries undergoing foodshortages and famines.
DDT was one of the first
pesticides that was developed. For many years, it was used suc-cessfully to protect crops and ﬁghtdisease epidemics. Paul Mueller,the scientist who discoveredDDT’s use as a pesticide, wasawarded the Nobel Prize in 1948.Later, however, tests revealed that
DDT does not readily decomposein the environment. Instead, DDTremains present in the soil fordecades after use. The hydrocarbonpart of this molecule makes it solu-ble in the fatty tissues of animals.As it passes through the foodchain, DDT accumulates. Animalsthat are higher in the food chain,such as large birds and ﬁsh, containdangerous concentrations of thischemical in their tissues. A highDDT concentration in birds causesthem to lay eggs with very thinshells, which are easily destroyed.Today DDT is no longer producedor used in Canada. It is still used,however, in many developingcountries.

Automobile fuels are graded using
octane numbers , which measure
the combustibility of a fuel. A highoctane number means that a fuelrequires a higher temperatureand/or higher pressure to ignite.Racing cars with high-compressionengines usually run on puremethanol, which has an octanenumber of 120.
Gasoline with too low
an octane number can cause“knocking” in the engine of a car,when the fuel ignites too easily andburns in an uncontrolled manner.Knocking lowers fuel efﬁciency,and it can damage the engine.
As early as 1925, two of the
ﬁrst automobile engineers becameaware of the need to improve theoctane number of fuels. CharlesKettering advocated the use of anewly developed compound calledtetra-ethyl lead, Pb(C
2H5)4. This
compound acts as a catalyst toincrease the efficiency of the
hydrocarbon combustion reaction.Henry Ford believed that ethanol,another catalyst, should be usedinstead of tetra-ethyl lead. Ethanolcould be produced easily fromlocally grown crops. As we nowknow, ethanol is also much betterfor the environment.
Tetra-ethyl lead became the
chosen fuel additive. Over manydecades, lead emissions from carexhausts accumulated in urbanponds and water systems. Manywaterfowl that live in urban areasexperience lead poisoning. Lead isalso dangerous to human health.
Leaded fuels are now banned
across Canada. In unleaded gaso-line, simple organic compoundsare added instead of lead com-pounds. These octane-enhancingcompounds include methyl-t-butylether, t-butyl alcohol, methanol,and ethanol. Like lead catalysts,these compounds help to reduce
engine knocking. In addition, burn-ing ethanol and methanol producesfewer pollutants than burninghydrocarbon fuels, which containcontaminants. Since they can bemade from crops, these alcoholsare a renewable resource.

UNIT 1 An Issue to Analyze
Current Issues
Related to OrganicChemistry
Background
Have you ever heard the saying “necessity is the
mother of invention”? Almost all new products aredeveloped to meet a need. As you have seen in thisunit, however, new products carry risks as well asbeneﬁts. Often, the development of a new product isopposed by groups of people who are concernedwith possible risks.
There may be several points of view about any
scientiﬁc development. These points of view areinﬂuenced by various factors such as the economy,society, and politics.
In this unit issue, you will explore the develop-
ment of new products through organic chemistry.You will choose one issue from the list below, andresearch the different points of view. Then you willpresent your ﬁndings, and your own point of view,to your class.
•Can biofuel be used to replace petroleum-based
fuels? Biofuel can be made from biological
materials, such as plants and animal fats.Biodiesel and ethanol are the two most commonbiological fuels. As part of your research, ﬁndout what biofuel is used for. Think about factorsthat may be holding back the sale of biofuel onthe Canadian market.
•Are Canadian processes for approving new phar-maceutical drugs adequate, too extensive, or notextensive enough? Some Canadians complain
about the long waiting period for a new foreigndrug to be approved in Canada. Why is there along waiting period? What testing processes areneeded for approval of a new drug in Canada?
•Why are some drugs so expensive? The
Canadian government recently increased its drugpatents from 17 years to 20 years. This shouldhelp drug companies make sufﬁcient proﬁts tocover the enormous costs of developing and test-ing new drugs. Find out about the costs and pro-cedures that are involved in developing and test-ing new drugs. Who ﬁnances drug research? Is itfair for drug companies to hold patents? Whathappens when these patents are not honoured? •Should all plastics that are made in the futurebe biodegradable? Biopolymers, such as pro-
teins and starches, are used to produce one typeof biodegradable plastic. Find out more aboutbiodegradable plastics. How are they made, andhow do they break down? What are the risks and beneﬁts?
•Are food additives necessary? Should they beregulated more closely? Almost all processed
foods contain food additives. Choose three or more food additives, not including any compounds that you may have researched inChapter 2. Research the uses, structures, andpurposes of the food additives you have chosen.

The northern lights, also called the aurora borealis , are a ﬂeeting feature
of the night sky in northern parts of the world. For centuries, people whosaw the shimmering, dancing sheets of coloured lights were awed by thephenomenon, and tried to explain it. Inuit that lived near Hudson’s Baytold that the lights were caused by torches held by spirits to lead souls ofthe dead to the afterlife. In Greenland and Labrador, people thought thelights could help predict the weather. In Europe in the Middle Ages, theirappearance was an omen of impending war or plague.
Today, scientists explain the northern lights as resulting from streams
of protons and electrons—plasma—emanating from the Sun. When theelectrons from the plasma interact with gaseous atoms in Earth’s upperatmosphere, the atoms emit coloured light.
Nineteenth-century atomic theory could not explain why the aurora
exhibits a limited range of speciﬁc wavelengths, rather than the full visible spectrum. Early in the twentieth century, however, scientists developed a revolutionary new model of the atom. This model, and thetheory that supports it, helped to account for many puzzling phenomenathat the existing atomic theory had failed to explain. Among these phenomena are the characteristic colours of the northern lights.
In this chapter, you will learn about the developments that led to the
modern model of the atom. You will also learn about the model itself andhow it relates to periodic trends and the periodic table.

Specific Expectations  3.1The Nuclear Atomic Model
Toward the close of the nineteenth century, chemists had two invaluable
conceptual tools to aid them in their understanding of matter. The ﬁrstwas John Dalton’s atomic theory, which you have studied intensively inprevious chemistry courses. Dalton’s atomic theory, ﬁrst published in1809, provided chemists with a framework for describing and explainingthe behaviour of matter during chemical reactions. As you can see inFigure 3.1, the model of the atom that resulted from this theory was very simple.
The second conceptual tool was Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic table,
which listed the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass. Theresulting organizational chart arranged elements so that those with similarchemical properties were grouped together in the same column.
As you know, Dalton’s atomic theory no longer applies in its original
form, and Mendeleev’s periodic table has undergone many changes. Forexample, scientists later discovered that atoms are not the most basic unitof matter because they aredivisible. As well, the modern periodic table
lists the elements in order of their atomic number, not their atomic mass.Of course, it also includes elements that had not been discovered inMendeleev’s time. Even so, in modiﬁed form, both of these inventions arestill studied and used today in every chemistry course around the world.
When Mendeleev invented the periodic table, he was well-acquainted
with Dalton’s atomic theory. He knew nothing, however, about subatomicparticles, and especially the electron, which is the foundation for themodern periodic table’s distinctive shape. Because the original periodictable developed out of experimental observations, chemists did not needan understanding of atomic structure to develop it. (As you will see insection 3.3, however, the periodic table easily accommodates details aboutatomic structure. In fact, you will learn that the modern periodic table’sdistinctive design is a natural consequence of atomic structure.)
The First Step Toward the Modern Atomic Model
Chemists needed Dalton’s atomic theory to advance their understanding of matter and its behaviour during chemical reactions. His atomic model,however, was inadequate for explaining the behaviour of substances. For example, Dalton designed a system of symbols to show how atomscombine to form other substances. Figure 3.2 on the next page shows several of these symbols. As you will no doubt notice, Dalton correctlypredicted the formulas for carbon dioxide and sulfur trioxide, but ran intoserious trouble with water, ammonia, and methane. Dalton’s attempt atmolecular modelling highlights a crucial limitation with his atomicmodel. Chemists could not use it to explain why atoms of elements
combine in the ratios in which they do. This inability did not preventchemists from pursuing their studies. It did, however, suggest the need for a more comprehensive atomic model.

The Discovery of the Electron Requires a New Atomic Model
In 1897, Dalton’s idea of an indivisible atom was shattered with a startling
announcement. A British scientist, Joseph John Thomson, had discoveredthe existence of a negatively charged particle with mass less than
1
1000
that of a hydrogen atom. This particle was, of course, the electron. (Later calculations showed that the mass of an electron is
1
1837that
of a hydrogen atom.) It took several years for chemists to consider the consequences of this discovery. They realized that if atoms contain electrons, atoms must also contain a positive charge of some kind to balance the negative charge. The atomic model that Thomson eventuallyproposed is shown in Figure 3.3. Keep in mind that scientists had not yet discovered the proton. Therefore, in this model, the entire sphere
carries a uniform, positive charge.
The atomic model in 1903. Thomson viewed the atom as a positively
charged sphere embedded with sufﬁcient numbers of electrons to balance (neutralize) the total charge.
Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of the Atom
In the last four years of the nineteenth century, scientists in France—
notably Henri Becquerel and Marie and Pierre Curie—discovered that certain elements are radioactive. That is, their atoms naturally emit positively charged particles (alpha particles), negatively charged particles(beta particles), and energy (gamma radiation).
Working in his laboratory at Montreal’s McGill University, Ernest
Rutherford studied the chemistry of radioactive elements intensively from1898 to 1907. His efforts would lead to a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in1908. Greater achievements lay ahead, however.Figure 3.3electrons

Scientists initially described
radioactivity solely in terms of radiation. The idea ofradioactive particles ﬁrst
appeared around the turn ofthe twentieth century. In 1909,Ernest Rutherford reportedconﬁdently that the alpha particle was, in fact, a heliumnucleus,
4
2He, with a 2+
charge. Scientists still had not discovered the proton by this time, so the nature ofthe helium nucleus (or anyother atomic nucleus) was still unknown. In 1919, the existence of the proton wasconﬁrmed experimentally by, appropriately enough,Rutherford himself.FACTCHEM
In 1909, two of Rutherford’s students reported observations that cast
doubts on Thomson’s atomic model. As part of ongoing investigations intothe nature and properties of radioactive emissions, they aimed alpha ( α)
particles at extremely thin metal foils. A small number of the alpha parti-cles, about one in every 8000, were deﬂected signiﬁcantly by the atomsthat made up the metal foils. These observations were inconsistent withThomson’s atomic model. The researchers expected the alpha particles to pass through the metal atoms with, at most, deﬂections averaging
1
200
of a degree. Therefore, deﬂections of 90˚ and more strained the credibility
of Thomson’s model. Rutherford encouraged further investigation. Eitherthe observations and data were ﬂawed, or Thomson’s atomic model was.
As you may recall from earlier studies, the ﬂaw lay in Thomson’s
model. In 1911, Rutherford published the results of the now-famous gold-foil experiment, shown in Figure 3.4. On the basis of this experi-ment, Rutherford suggested that the deﬂections he and his studentsobserved were caused by an encounter between an alpha particle and an intense electric ﬁeld at the centre of the atom.
The hypothesis, experiment, and results of Rutherford’s gold foil experiment.
The experimental hypothesis and design owed much to the contributions of Rutherford’s students, Hans Geiger (of Geiger-counter fame) and Ernest Marsden.
Rutherford performed several calculations that led him to an inescapable
conclusion: the atom is made up mainly of empty space, with a small,massive region of concentrated charge at the centre. Soon afterward, thecharge on this central region was determined to be positive, and wasnamed the atomic nucleus. Because Rutherford’s atomic model, shown in Figure 3.5 on the next page, pictures electrons in motion around anatomic nucleus, chemists often call this the nuclear model of the atom.
You may also see it referred to as a planetary model because the electronsresemble the planets in motion around a central body.Figure 3.4

122 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesThe atomic model in 1911. A Japanese scientist, Hantaro Nagaoka, proposed a
similar, disk-shaped model with electrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus, in 1904.Rutherford notes in his 1911 paper that his results would be the same if Nagaoka ’s model
were correct.
Prelude to a New Atomic Model
Rutherford’s atomic model solved problems inherent in Thomson’s
atomic model, but it also raised others. For example, an atomic nucleuscomposed entirely of positive charges should ﬂy apart due to electrostaticforces of repulsion. Furthermore, Rutherford’s nuclear atom could notadequately explain the total mass of an atom. The discovery of the neutron, in 1932, eventually helped to settle these questions.
There was a more signiﬁcant problem, however. Rutherford’s atomic
model seemed to contradict the laws of nineteenth-century physics.According to these assumptions, an electron in motion around a centralbody must continuously give off radiation. Consequently, one should be
able to observe a continuous spectrum (a “rainbow”) of light energy as theelectron gives off its radiation.
Because the electron should also lose energy as a result of this
radiation, the radius of its orbit should continuously decrease in size until it spirals into the nucleus. This predicted annihilation of the atomwould occur in a fraction of a second. However, atoms were not seen todestabilize as predicted by this model.
Nineteenth-century physics could not explain why Rutherford’s
model corresponded to a stable atom. The solution to this problemmarked a turning point in the history of chemistry and physics. To appreciate the scope of the problem, and the impact of its eventual solution, it is necessary to remain a short while longer in the nineteenthcentury. In the following pages, you will examine a phenomenon that scientists of the time could not explain.
The Problem of Atomic Spectra
You probably recall that visible light is part of a broader continuum of energy called the electromagnetic spectrum. Figure 3.6 reviews the keyproperties of the electromagnetic spectrum of energy.Figure 3.5
electrons around nucleus nucleus (later determined
to be positively charged)
Contrary to common belief,
Rutherford’s 1911 paper on thediscovery of the nucleus doesnotassociate the nucleus with
a positive charge. In fact,Rutherford acknowledged thatthe results of his experimentwere independent of the signof the charge. He suggestedthat the charge of the nucleus,as well as other questionsraised by his paper, were sub-jects for later investigation.Sometime between 1911 and1913, someone identiﬁed thecharge on the nucleus as positive. Whether or not thisperson was Rutherford is not clear.FACTCHEM
Chemists used spectral
analysis during the nineteenthcentury to analyze substancesand, sometimes, to discovernew elements. Another common technique for analyz-ing substances, often used inconjunction with spectralanalysis is a ﬂame test. One ofthe foremost practitioners ofthis technique was a chemistnamed Robert Bunsen.

The electromagnetic spectrum and its properties
The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is called a continuous
spectrum, because the component colours are indistinct. They appear“smeared” together into a continuum of colour. According to nineteenth-century physics, part of the energy emitted by electrons should be
observable as a continuous spectrum. This is not, however, the case.Instead, when atoms absorb energy (for example, when they are exposedto an electric current), you observe a pattern of discrete (distinct),coloured lines separated by spaces of varying length. See Figure 3.7. Youcan also observe this line spectrum for hydrogen, and for other atoms, in
Investigation 3-A.
The discrete, coloured lines of this spectrum are characteristic of
hydrogen atoms. No other atoms display this pattern of coloured lines.Figure 3.7400 500 600 750 nmFigure 3.61 secondInfrared-

126 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesThe Bohr Model of the Atom
Scientists of the nineteenth century lacked the concepts necessary to
explain line spectra. Even in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, asuitable explanation proved elusive. This changed in 1913 when NielsBohr, a Danish physicist and student of Rutherford, proposed a newmodel for the hydrogen atom. This model retained some of the features ofRutherford’s model. More importantly, it was able to explain the line spec-trum for hydrogen because it incorporated several new ideas about energy.As you can see in Figure 3.8, Bohr’s atomic model pictures electrons inorbit around a central nucleus. Unlike Rutherford’s model, however, inwhich electrons may move anywhere within the volume of space aroundthe nucleus, Bohr’s model imposes certain restrictions.
On what basis could Bohr make these claims? In 1900, a physicist named
Max Planck proposed an idea that was so revolutionary that he himselfwas unwilling to accept its implications. Planck suggested that matter, at
the atomic level, can absorb or emit only discrete quantities of energy .
Each of these speciﬁc quantities is called a quantum of energy. In other
words, Planck said that the energy of an atom is quantized . Something
that is quantized can exist only in certain discrete amounts. It is not continuous. In this sense, the rungs of a ladder are quantized, while thesmooth slope of a ramp is not. Unlike ladders and ramps, however, aquantum is an extremely small “packet” of energy.
Although Planck said that the energy of matter is quantized, he con-
tinued to describe energy as travelling in the form of waves. He was, infact, unwilling to consider that energy might have particle-like properties.In 1905, however, Albert Einstein was prepared to make just such anassertion. Light, according to Einstein, is also quantized. It occurs asquanta of electromagnetic energy that have particle-like properties. Theseparticle-like “packets” of energy were later called photons . In Einstein’s
view, light (and, by extension, all electromagnetic energy) travels in theform of photons of energy. Light is emitted as photons of energy, and lightis absorbed as photons of energy.
How Bohr’s Atomic Model
Explains the Spectrum for Atomic Hydrogen
If you re-read the key points of Bohr’s atomic model above, you can see
that he is applying the new ideas of quanta in his model. Bohr proposedthat the energy that is emitted and absorbed by an atom must have speciﬁc values. The change in energy when an electron moves to higher or lower energy levels is not continuous. It is, rather, quantized.The Bohr Atomic Model
1.The atom has only speciﬁc, allowable energy levels, called
stationary states. Each stationary state corresponds to the atom’selectrons occupying ﬁxed, circular orbits around the nucleus.
2.While in one of its stationary states, atoms do notemit energy.
3.An atom changes stationary states by emitting or absorbing a
speciﬁc quantity of energy that is exactly equal to the difference in energy between the two stationary states.

The model of the atom
in 1913. Although Bohr pictured the atom in three dimensions, it ispresented here, in two dimensions,to simplify some of Bohr ’s
revolutionary concepts.Figure 3.8
Look again at the line spectrum for hydrogen shown in Figure 3.7.
The energy that is associated with the coloured lines in this spectrum corresponds to the change in energy of an electron as it moves to higher or lower energy levels. For example, when a hydrogen atom is exposed to electrical current, or to another form of electromagnetic energy, its electron absorbs photons of energy. The atom is now said to be in anexcited state. Another common way for atoms to become excited is
through atomic collisions. For example, when two hydrogen atoms collide, some of the kinetic energy from one atom is transferred to theother atom. The electron of the second hydrogen atom absorbs this energyand is excited to a higher energy level.
When the electron of a hydrogen atom that has been excited to the
third energy level falls to the second energy level, it emits light of certainenergy. Speciﬁcally, an electron that makes a transition from the thirdenergy level to the second energy level emits a photon of red light with a wavelength of 656 nm. Because line spectra result when atoms in anexcited state emit photons as they fall to a lower energy level, these
spectra are also called emission spectra .
Figure 3.9 shows the energy transitions that are responsible for the
coloured lines in hydrogen’s emission spectrum. Notice the use of thesymbol nto designate the allowed energy levels for the hydrogen atom:
n=1, n=2, and so on. This symbol, n, represents a positive integer (such
as 1, 2, or 3), and is called a quantum number . You will learn more about
the signiﬁcance of quantum numbers in section 3.2.
How the Bohr model explains the coloured lines in hydrogen ’s emission
spectrum. When an excited electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower energy level(shown by the downward-pointing arrows), it emits a photon with a speci ﬁc wavelength that
corresponds to one of the coloured lines in the spectrum.Figure 3.9n = 6

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 127
128 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesAnother kind of spectrum that is related to an atom’s emission spec-
trum is an absorption spectrum . This kind of spectrum results when
electrons of atoms absorb photons of certain wavelengths, and so areexcited from lower energy levels to higher energy levels. Figure 3.10shows the absorption spectrum for hydrogen. As you can see, discrete,dark lines appear in the precise locations (wavelengths) as those of thecoloured lines in hydrogen’s emission spectrum.
When light passes through gaseous hydrogen atoms, the electrons in the
hydrogen atoms absorb photons of red, green, blue, and purple light at speci ﬁc wavelengths.
When the electrons return to lower energy levels, they re-emit photons with these samewavelengths. However, most of the photons are emitted in a different direction from the one inwhich the electrons absorbed the light. As a result, dark lines appear in the spectrum wherephotons of those particular wavelengths are absent.
The Successes and Limitations of the Bohr Atomic Model
Bohr’s realization that the atom’s energy is quantized—that electrons are
restricted to speciﬁc energy levels (orbits)—was an astounding achieve-ment. As you have seen, this model successfully predicted the colouredlines in the visible-light portion of hydrogen’s emission spectrum. It also successfully predicted other lines, shown in Figure 3.11, that earlierchemists had discovered in the ultraviolet and infrared portions of hydrogen’s emission spectrum.
The ultraviolet series of lines appear as a result of electrons falling from higher
energy levels to n=1. The infrared lines appear as a result of electrons falling from higher
energy levels to n=3.Figure 3.110

Bohr’s model was unable, however, to explain the emission spectra produced by atoms with two or more electrons. Either Bohr’s model was a coincidence, or it was an oversimpliﬁcation in need of modiﬁcation.Further investigation was in order.

This scan, a product of a nuclear medical technology called
PET, shows changes in metabolic activity in different parts ofthe brain. The red colour indicates greater activity.
The discovery of the atomic nucleus affected all
sciences, including biology and its applications inthe ﬁeld of medicine. During her graduate studies
at the University of Western Ontario, Dr. KarenGoulenchyn excelled in theoretical mathematics, but switched to medicine because she was drawn to practical applications of science in people ’s
lives. An interest in computers led her to nuclearmedicine, which she now practices at the CivicHospital in Ottawa.
Nuclear medicine is used chie ﬂy in medical
diagnosis. A radiopharmaceutical —a relatively
harmless compound with a low dose of radiation —
is swallowed or injected into the patient and trackedthrough the bloodstream by instruments such as aPET (positron emission tomography) camera. Thenuclear physician can use the results to create athree-dimensional computer image that evaluates
the function as well as the structure of an organ.This procedure enables the physician to diagnosecancers and other tissue irregularities without theneed for more invasive techniques such asexploratory surgery.
The dose of radiation that patients receive is
similar to that of a diagnostic x-ray. However,because many patients are alarmed by the word“nuclear, ” Dr. Goulenchyn says that her team must
explain the procedure tactfully “so that they don ’t
run away. ” Some physicians ease fears by calling
the discipline “molecular medicine. ”
Dr. Goulenchyn sees an increase of 6 to12
percent of patients annually, primarily for suspectedcancer or heart disease. Her greatest frustration is the time she must spend lobbying for new equipment, particularly for PET, a technique formeasuring the concentrations of positron-emittingradioisotopes within the tissues. Positrons are aform of radiation identical to a beam of electrons,except that the charge of a positron is positive. PETscans can assess biochemical changes in the body,especially abnormal ones. These scans providegreater accuracy in determining whether a currentor proposed therapy is effective.
A career in nuclear medicine, Dr. Goulenchyn

Specific Expectations  3.2The Quantum Mechanical Model
of the Atom
You have seen how Bohr’s model of the atom explains the emission spec-
trum of hydrogen. The emission spectra of other atoms, however, posed aproblem. A mercury atom, for example, has many more electrons than ahydrogen atom. As you can see in Figure 3.12, mercury has more spectrallines than hydrogen does. The same is true for other many-electron atoms.Observations like these forced Bohr and other scientists to reconsider thenature of energy levels. The large spaces between the individual colourssuggested that there are energy differences between individual energy levels, as stated in Bohr’s model. The smaller spaces between colouredlines, however, suggested that there were smaller energy differences within energy levels. In other words, scientists hypothesized that there are
sublevels within each energy level. Each of these sublevels has its own
slightly different energy.
The emission spectrum for mercury shows that it has more spectral lines
than the emission spectrum for hydrogen.
It was fairly straightforward to modify Bohr’s model to include the idea
of energy sublevels for the hydrogen spectrum and for atoms or ions withonly one electron. There was a more fundamental problem, however. Themodel still could not explain the spectra produced by many-electronatoms. Therefore, a simple modiﬁcation of Bohr’s atomic model was notenough. The many-electron problem called for a new model to explainspectra of all types of atoms. However, this was not possible until anotherimportant property of matter was discovered.
The Discovery of Matter Waves
By the early 1920s, it was standard knowledge that energy had matter-likeproperties. In 1924, a young physics student named Louis de Broglie stated a hypothesis that followed from this idea. What if, de Broglie wondered, matter has wave-like properties?
He developed an equation that enabled him to calculate the wave-
length associated with any object — large, small, or microscopic. Forexample, a baseball with a mass of 142 g and moving with a speed of 25.0 m/s has a wavelength of 2×10
−34m. Objects that you can see and
interact with, such as a baseball, have wavelengths so small that they do not have any signiﬁcant observable effect on the object’s motion.However, for microscopic objects, such as electrons, the effect of wave-length on motion becomes very signiﬁcant. For example, an electron moving at a speed of 5.9×10
6m/s has a wavelength of 1×10−10m. The
size of this wavelength is greater than the size of the hydrogen atom towhich it belongs. (The calculated atomic radius of hydrogen is

132 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesDe Broglie’s hypothesis of matter waves received experimental
support in 1927. Researchers observed that streams of moving electronsproduced diffraction patterns similar to those that are produced by wavesof electromagnetic radiation. Since diffraction involves the transmissionof waves through a material, the observation seemed to support the ideathat electrons had wave-like properties.
The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom
In 1926, an Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrödinger, used mathematics andstatistics to combine de Broglie’s idea of matter waves and Einstein’s ideaof quantized energy particles (photons). Schrödinger’s mathematical equations and their interpretations, together with another idea calledHeisenberg’s uncertainty principle (discussed below), resulted in the birthof the ﬁeld of quantum mechanics . This is a branch of physics that uses
mathematical equations to describe the wave properties of sub-microscopicparticles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. Schrödinger used concepts from quantum mechanics to propose a new atomic model: thequantum mechanical model of the atom . This model describes atoms as
having certain allowed quantities of energy because of the wave-like properties of their electrons.
Figure 3.13 depicts the volume surrounding the nucleus of the atom
as being indistinct or cloud-like because of a scientiﬁc principle called theuncertainty principle . The German physicist Werner Heisenberg proposed
the uncertainty principle in 1927. Using mathematics, Heisenberg showedthat it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of anobject beyond a certain measure of precision. (An object’s momentum is aproperty given by its mass multiplied by its velocity.) According to thisprinciple, if you can know an electron’s precise position and path aroundthe nucleus, as you would by deﬁning its orbit, you cannot know withcertainty its velocity. Similarly, if you know its precise velocity, you cannot know with certainty its position. Based on the uncertainty principle, Bohr’s atomic model is ﬂawed because you cannot assign ﬁxed paths (orbits) to the motion of electrons.
Clearly, however, electrons exist. And they must exist somewhere . To
describe where that “somewhere” is, scientists used an idea from a branchof mathematics called statistics. Although you cannot talk about electronsin terms of certainties, you cantalk about them in terms of probabilities.
Schrödinger used a type of equation called a wave equation to deﬁne theprobability of ﬁnding an atom’s electrons at a particular point within theatom. There are many solutions to this wave equation, and each solutionrepresents a particular wave function. Each wave function gives informa-tion about an electron’s energy and location within an atom. Chemists call these wave functions orbitals .
In further studies of chemistry and physics, you will learn that the
wave functions that are solutions to the Schrödinger equation have nodirect, physical meaning. They are mathematical ideas. However, thesquare of a wave function does have a physical meaning. It is a quantitythat describes the probability that an electron is at a particular point within the atom at a particular time. The square of each wave function(orbital) can be used to plot three-dimensional probability distributiongraphs for that orbital. These plots help chemists visualize the space inwhich electrons are most likely to be found around atoms. These plots areThe model of the
atom in 1927. The fuzzy, sphericalregion that surrounds the nucleusrepresents the volume in whichelectrons are most likely to befound.Figure 3.13
also referred to as electron probability density graphs. Note: Although
orbitals are wave functions without associated physical characteristicslike shape and size, chemists often use the term orbitals when they mean
three-dimensional probability distribution graphs. To simplify discussion,this textbook will discuss the size and shapes of orbitals. However, whatis really meant is their associated probability distribution graph, which iscalculated using the square of the wave function.
Each orbital has its own associated energy, and each represents
information about where, inside the atom, the electrons would spendmost of their time. Scientists cannot determine the actual paths of themoving electrons. However, orbitals indicate where there is a high probability of ﬁnding electrons.
Figure 3.14A represents the probability of ﬁnding an electron at any
point in space when the electron is at the lowest energy level ( n=1) of a
hydrogen atom. Where the density of the dots is greater, there is a higherprobability of ﬁnding the electron. This graph is “fuzzy-looking” becausethe probability of ﬁnding the electron anywhere in the n=1energy
level of a hydrogen atom is never zero. Farther from the nucleus, the probability becomes very small, but it will still never reach zero.Therefore, because the shape of the n=1orbital for hydrogen represents
the level of probability of ﬁnding an electron, and since the probabilitynever reaches zero, you have to select a “cut-off” level of probability. A level of probability is usually expressed as a percentage. Therefore, the contour line in Figure 3.14B deﬁnes an area that represents 95 percentof the probability graph. This two-dimensional shape is given threedimensions in Figure 3.14C. What this means is that, at any time, there is a 95 percent chance of ﬁnding the electron within the volume deﬁnedby the spherical contour.
Electron density probability graphs for the lowest energy level in the hydrogen
atom. These diagrams represent the probability of ﬁnding an electron at any point in this
energy level.
Quantum Numbers and Orbitals
Figure 3.14 showed electron-density probabilities for the lowest energy
level of the hydrogen atom. This is the most stable energy state for hydrogen, and is called the ground state . The quantum number, n, for a
hydrogen atom in its ground state is 1. When n=1in the hydrogen atom,
its electron is associated with an orbital that has a characteristic energyand shape. In an excited state, the electron is associated with a differentorbital with its own characteristic energy and shape. This makes sense,because the electron has absorbed energy in its excited state, so its totalenergy increases and its motion changes. Figure 3.15 on the next pagecompares the sizes of hydrogen’s atomic orbitals when the atom is in itsground state and when it is in an excited state.Figure 3.14

electron orbit, as depicted inBohr’s atomic model, and anelectron orbital, as depicted inthe quantum mechanical modelof the atom.
134 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesOrbitals have a variety of different possible shapes. Therefore,
scientists use three quantum numbers to describe an atomic orbital. Onequantum number, n, describes an orbital’s energy level and size. A second
quantum number, l, describes an orbital’s shape. A third quantum number,
m
l, describes an orbital’s orientation in space. These three quantum
numbers are described further below. The Concept Organizer that followsafterward summarizes this information. (In section 3.3, you will learnabout a fourth quantum number, m
s, which is used to describe the
electron inside an orbital.)
The First Quantum Number:
Describing Orbital Energy Level and Size
The principal quantum number ( n)is a positive whole number that
speciﬁes the energy level of an atomic orbital and its relative size. Thevalue of n, therefore, may be 1, 2, 3, and so on. A higher value for n
indicates a higher energy level. A higher nvalue also means that the
size of the energy level is larger, with a higher probability of ﬁnding an electron farther from the nucleus. The greatest number of electrons that is possible in any energy level is 2n
2.
The Second Quantum Number: Describing Orbital Shape
The second quantum number describes an orbital’s shape, and is a posi-
tive integer that ranges in value from 0 to ( n−1). Chemists use a variety
of names for the second quantum number. For example, you may see itreferred to as the angular momentum quantum number, the azimuthalquantum number, the secondary quantum number, or the orbital-shapequantum number.
Regardless of its name, the second quantum number refers to the
energy sublevels within each principal energy level. The name that thisbook uses for the second quantum number is orbital-shape quantum
number ( l), to help you remember that the value of ldetermines orbital
shape. (You will see examples of orbital shapes near the end of this section.)
The value of nplaces precise limits on the value of l. Recall that l
has a maximum value of ( n−1). So, if n=1, l=0(that is, 1−1). If n=2,
lmay be either 0 or 1. If n=3, lmay be either 0, 1, or 2. Notice that the
number of possible values for lin a given energy level is the same as the
value of n. In other words, if n=2, then there are only two possible sub-
levels (two types of orbital shapes) at this energy level.Each value for lis given a letter: s, p, d, or f.
•The l=0orbital has the letter s.
•The l=1orbital has the letter p.
•The l=2orbital has the letter d.
•The l=3orbital has the letter f.
To identify an energy sublevel (type of orbital), you combine the value
of nwith the letter of the orbital shape. For example, the sublevel with
n=3and l=0is called the 3 ssublevel. The sublevel with n=2and l=1
is the 2 psublevel.The relationship
between orbital size and quantumnumber for the hydrogen atom. As nincreases, the electron ’s
energy increases and orbital sizeincreases.Figure 3.15n = 1
n = 2
n = 3
There are, in fact, additional sublevels beyond l=3. However, for
chemical systems known at this time, only the s, p, d, and fsublevels are
required.
The Third Quantum Number: Describing Orbital Orientation
The magnetic quantum number ( ml)is an integer with values ranging
from −lto +l, including 0. This quantum number indicates the orientation
of the orbital in the space around the nucleus. The value of mlis limited
by the value of l. If l=0, mlcan be only 0. In other words, for a given
value of n, there is only one orbital, of s type ( l=0). If l=1, mlmay have
one of three values: −1, 0, or +1. In other words, for a given value of n,
there are three orbitals of ptype ( l=1). Each of these porbitals has the
same shape and energy, but a different orientation around the nucleus.Notice that for any given value of l, there are ( 2l+1) values for m
l.
The total number of orbitals for any energy level nis given by n2.
For example, if n=2, it has a total of 4 (that is, 22)orbitals (an sorbital
and three porbitals). The Sample Problem below shows further use of
this calculation.

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 137Shapes of Orbitals
An orbital is associated with a size, a three-dimensional shape, and an
orientation around the nucleus. Together, the size, shape, and position of an orbital represent the probability of ﬁnding a speciﬁc electron around the nucleus of an atom. Figure 3.16 shows the probability shapesassociated with the s, p, and dorbitals. (The forbitals have been omitted
due to their complexity. You may study these orbitals in post-secondaryschool chemistry courses.)
Notice that the overall shape of an atom is a combination of all its
orbitals. Thus, the overall shape of an atom is spherical. Be careful, how-ever, to distinguish for yourself between the overall spherical shape of theatom, and the spherical shape that is characteristic of only the sorbitals.
Finally, it is important to be clear about what orbitals are when you
view diagrams such as those in Figure 3.16. Orbitals, remember, are solu-tions to mathematical equations. Those solutions, when manipulated,describe the motion and position of the electron in terms of probabilities.Contour diagrams, such as those shown here and in numerous print andelectronic resources, appear solid . It therefore becomes easy to begin
thinking about orbitals as physical “containers” that are “occupied” byelectrons. In some ways, this is unavoidable. Try to remind yourself, now and then, of the following:
•Electrons have physical substance. They have a mass that can be
measured, and trajectories that can be photographed. They exist in the physical universe.
•Orbitals are mathematical descriptions of electrons. They do not have
measurable physical properties such as mass or temperature. They existin the imagination.

In this section, you saw how the ideas of quantum mechanics led to a
new, revolutionary atomic model—the quantum mechanical model of the atom. According to this model, electrons have both matter-like andwave-like properties. Their position and momentum cannot both be deter-mined with certainty, so they must be described in terms of probabilities.An orbital represents a mathematical description of the volume of spacein which an electron has a high probability of being found. You learnedthe ﬁrst three quantum numbers that describe the size, energy, shape, and orientation of an orbital. In the next section, you will use quantumnumbers to describe the total number of electrons in an atom and theenergy levels in which they are most likely to be found in their groundstate.

Electron Conﬁgurations
and Periodic Trends
For the hydrogen atom (and other single-electron systems), all orbitals that
have the same value for nhave the same energy. You can see this in the
energy level diagram shown in Figure 3.17. Hydrogen’s single electron isin its lowest (most stable) energy state when it is in the 1 sorbital. In other
words, the 1 sorbital is the ground state for hydrogen. When a hydrogen
atom is in an excited state, its electron may be found in any of its otherorbitals, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
For the hydrogen atom, orbital energy depends only on the value of n. For
example, all four n=2orbitals have the same energy. All nine n=3orbitals have the same
energy. What must the value of lbe for each of these orbitals?
Atoms with two or more electrons have orbitals with shapes that are
similar to those of hydrogen. However, the interactions among the additional electrons result in orbitals with the same value of n, but
different energies . For example, Figure 3.18 shows an energy level
diagram for the lithium atom, which has three electrons. You can see thatthe 2 sorbital has a lower energy than the 2 porbitals. Similarly, the 3 p
orbitals are lower in energy than the 3 dorbitals. Notice, however, that all
the orbitals within a sublevel have the same energy. For example, thethree porbitals in the 3 psublevel have the same energy.
In the lithium atom, and for all other multi-electron atoms, orbitals in different
energy sublevels differ in energy.Figure 3.181s2s3s3p3d

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 139
140 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesSince low energy usually means stability, it is reasonable that the
most stable energy state (ground state) for any atom is one in which itselectrons are in the lowest possible energy level. As you know, this is the1sorbital ( n=1). However, the electrons of most atoms are not “packed”
into this orbital. In fact, experimental evidence shows that only two atomshave all their electrons in the 1 sorbital: hydrogen and helium. To explain
how and why this is the case, you must consider another property of theelectron.
The Fourth Quantum Number: A Property of the Electron
As you learned from the previous section, three quantum numbers— n, l,
and ml—describe the energy, size, shape, and spatial orientation of an
orbital. A fourth quantum number describes a property of the electron thatresults from its particle-like nature. Experimental evidence suggests thatelectrons spin about their axes as they move throughout the volume oftheir atoms. Like a tiny top, an electron can spin in one of two directions,each direction generating a magnetic ﬁeld. The spin quantum number
(m
s)speciﬁes the direction in which the electron is spinning. This
quantum number has only two possible values: +1
2or −1
2.
In 1925, an Austrian physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, proposed that only two
electrons of opposite spin could occupy an orbital . This proposal became
known as the Pauli exclusion principle . What the exclusion principle
does is place a limit on the total number of electrons that may occupy anyorbital. That is, an orbital may have a maximum of two electrons only,each of which must have the opposite spin direction of the other. It mayalso have only one electron of either spin direction. An orbital may alsohave no electrons at all.
Summarizing the Four Quantum Numbers for Electrons in Atoms
The Pauli Exclusion Principle and Quantum Numbers
Another way of stating the exclusion principle is that no two electrons
in an atom have the same four quantum numbers . This important idea
means that each electron in an atom has its own unique set of four quantum numbers. For example, compare the quantum numbers that distinguish a ground state hydrogen atom from a helium atom. (Recallthat a helium atom has two electrons. Note also that m
squantum number
is given as +1

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 141Each of a lithium atom ’s three electrons also has its own unique set of
quantum numbers, as you can see below. (Assume these quantum numbers represent a ground state lithium atom.)
Consider the signi ﬁcance of lithium ’s quantum numbers. The ﬁrst two
electrons occupy the 1 sorbital, and have the same sets of quantum
numbers as helium ’s two electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion
principle, the 1 sorbital ( n=1) is now “full” because it contains the
maximum number of electrons: two. For lithium ’s third electron, n
cannot equal 1. Therefore, the next principal energy level for the electronis n=2. If n=2, lmay have a value of 0 or 1. Remember that an atom ’s
ground state represents its lowest energy state. Because an orbital with
l=0(an sorbital) has a lower energy than an orbital with l=1
(a porbital), you would expect a high probability of ﬁnding lithium ’s
third electron in the sorbital given by n=2, l=0. In fact, experimental
evidence supports this expectation. You know that if l=0, m
lhas only
one possible value: 0. Finally, by convention, msis +1
2.
It is possible to distinguish atoms by writing sets of quantum numbers
for each of their electrons. However, writing quantum numbers for anatom such as uranium, which has 92 electrons, would be mind-bogglinglytedious. Fortunately, chemists have developed a “shortcut ” to represent
the number and orbital arrangements of electrons in each atom. As youwill see shortly, these electron con ﬁgurations, as they are called, are
intimately connected to the structure and logic of the periodic table. In learning how to write electron con ﬁgurations, you will discover this
connection. You will also ﬁnd out why orbital energies differ (for
example, why a 2 sorbital is lower in energy than a 2 porbital).
Note: Before proceeding, it is important to keep the following in mind.
According to quantum mechanics:
•Electrons do not “occupy ” orbitals. Nor do orbitals “contain ” electrons.
•Electrons do not “ﬁll” orbitals one at a time. Nor do electrons have
properties that designate individual electrons as ﬁrst, second, third,
fourth, etc.
•Orbitals do not really have substance or shapes. Orbitals, recall,
are mathematical equations that can be used to calculate probabilitydensities for electrons. The shapes, and the impression of substance,result from the contour lines used to set a limit on the extent of those probabilities.
Nevertheless , it takes time and experience for most people to think
about and talk about atoms in completely quantum mechanical terms. It ismuch simpler to think about orbitals as if they have substance. Therefore,in the text that follows, you will read about electrons “occupying ” and
“ﬁlling ” orbitals. Strictly speaking, this terminology is not scienti ﬁcally
correct. However, it will help you understand some challenging conceptsmore easily.LithiumAtom Electron

An Introduction to Electron Con ﬁgurations
Atomic orbitals and their relative energies
Figure 3.19 shows the total number of orbitals in which electrons are
likely to be found for all naturally occurring atoms and most syntheticatoms. The orbitals, represented by boxes, are listed in order of increasingenergy. You will refer to this diagram often as you learn to write electronconﬁgurations.
An atom ’s electron conﬁguration is a shorthand notation that shows
the number and arrangement of electrons in its orbitals. Because the value of nranges to in ﬁnity, there are an in ﬁnite number of electron
conﬁgurations that are possible for each atom. For each atom, all but
one of these represent the atom in an excited state. However, an atom’s
chemical properties are mainly associated with its ground state electronconﬁguration . Therefore, unless stated otherwise, you can assume that
any given electron con ﬁguration in this book represents an atom in its
ground state. For example, the ground state electron con ﬁguration for a
hydrogen atom is 1s
1(pronounced “one ess one ”). The superscript 1 indi-
cates that only one electron is in the s orbital. The ground state electronconﬁguration for a helium atom is 1s
2(pronounced “one ess two ”), where
the superscript 2 indicates that there are two electrons in the sorbital. For
a lithium atom, it is 1s22s1. Again, the superscript numbers indicate the
number of electrons in each of the orbitals.
When you are learning to write electron con ﬁgurations, it is helpful to
start with the ﬁrst element in the periodic table (hydrogen), and “build
up” the electronic structure of its atom by adding an electron to its lowest
available energy level. Then you move on to the next element (helium) byadding a proton (and several neutrons) to the nucleus, and by adding anelectron to the appropriate orbital. This imaginary process of building upthe ground state electronic structure for each atom, in order of atomicnumber, is called the aufbau principle . (Aufbau comes from a German
word that means “to build up. ”)Figure 3.193d4d5d6d

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 143Writing Electron Con ﬁgurations
Electron con ﬁgurations, as they are used in this book, provide information
about the ﬁrst two quantum numbers, nand l. (Electron con ﬁgurations
may also re ﬂect the third quantum number, ml, but this notation goes
beyond the scope of this chemistry course.) The electron con ﬁguration
below represents a boron atom in its ground state.
From the few examples of electron con ﬁgurations that you have seen so
far, you may have noticed that they do not include information about the spin direction of the electron. Once you have considered the electronconﬁgurations for a variety of atoms, you will see that you can safely infer
where electrons with opposite spins have been paired together.
There is, however, a system that chemists use alongside electron
conﬁgurations to help them plot and keep track of electrons in their
orbitals. An orbital diagram uses a box for each orbital in any given
principal energy level. (Some chemists use a circle or a line instead of
a box.) An empty box represents an orbital in which there are no electrons (an “unoccupied ” orbital). A box that has an upward-pointing
arrow represents an orbital with an electron that spins in one
direction. A box with a downward-pointing arrow represents an orbital with an electron that spins in the opposite direction. You can probably surmise that a box with oppositely pointing arrows
represents a ﬁlled orbital.
You are nearly ready to begin “building up ” the electronic structures of
the atoms, using both electron con ﬁgurations and orbital diagrams. Below
you will ﬁnd some guidelines to help you. Refer to these guidelines and
to Figure 3.19 as you work your way through the information that follows.
Guidelines 3 and 4 together comprise what is known as Hund’s rule .
If you “obey ” Hund ’s rule, no two electrons can have the same set of
quantum numbers. Thus, this rule follows from Pauli ’s exclusion principle.Guidelines for “Filling ” Orbitals
1.Place electrons into the orbitals in order of increasing energy level.
2.Each set of orbitals of the same energy level must be completely
ﬁlled before proceeding to the next orbital or series of orbitals.
3.Whenever electrons are added to orbitals of the same energy sub-
level, each orbital receives one electron before any pairing occurs.
4.When electrons are added singly to separate orbitals of the sameenergy, the electrons must all have the same spin.1s22s22p1

Below are the electron con ﬁgurations for atoms of the ﬁrst ten elements,
along with their orbital diagrams.
Figure 3.20 presents the same basic information about the ﬁrst ten
elements, arranged in the form of the periodic table. Using these electronconﬁgurations, orbital diagrams, and Figure 3.20, you can probably follow
the logic that leads to the electronic structure of each atom. As you examine and compare this information, note the following.
•The energy of each orbital (or each group of orbitals) increases as you
move from left to right.
•Boron ’s ﬁfth electron must go into the 2 penergy sublevel. Since l=1,
m
lmay be −1, 0, or +1. The ﬁfth electron can go into any of these
orbitals, because they all have the same energy. When you draw orbitaldiagrams, it is customary to place the electron in the ﬁrst available box,
from left to right.
•With carbon, you must apply Hund ’s rule. In other words, carbon ’s sixth
electron must go into the next unoccupied 2 porbital. (Experimental
evidence con ﬁrms that the spin of this sixth electron is, in fact, the
same direction as the ﬁfth electron.)
•With oxygen, as with helium ’s 1s orbital and beryllium ’s 2s orbital, the
last-added (eighth) electron is paired with a 2p electron of oppositespin. In other words, the Pauli exclusion principle applies.

Electron Con ﬁgurations and Orbital Diagrams for Period 3
To write the electron con ﬁgurations and draw the orbital diagrams for
atoms of Period 3 elements, you follow the same process as for Period 2.The practice problems below give you the chance to write and draw theserepresentations. In doing so, you will observe a pattern that enables you totake a “shortcut ” in writing electron con ﬁgurations. As the atomic number
increases, electron con ﬁgurations become longer and longer. You know
that chemical reactivity depends mainly on an atom ’s valence electrons:
the electrons in the outermost-occupied principle energy level. To highlight these electrons, you can use a simpli ﬁed notation called a
condensed electron con ﬁguration . This notation places the electron
conﬁguration of the noble gas of the previous period in square brackets,
using its atomic symbol only. Then you continue with the con ﬁguration of
the next energy level that is being ﬁlled.
The condensed electron con ﬁguration for a nitrogen atom, for
example, is [He]2 s
22p3. The notation [He] is used to represent 1s2. For a
sodium atom ( Z=11), the condensed electron con ﬁguration is [Ne]3 s1.
Here, [Ne] represents, 1s22s22p6. Be aware that condensed electron
conﬁgurations are simply convenient short forms. Thus, [Ne]3 s1does not
mean that a sodium atom is the same as a neon atom plus one electron.Sodium and neon are different elements because the nuclei of their atomsare completely different.Figure 3.20Li

Electron Con ﬁgurations and Orbital Diagrams for Period 4
You may have noticed that period 3 ended with electrons ﬁlling the 3 p
energy sublevel. However, when n=3, lmay equal 0, 1, and2. Perhaps
you wondered what happened to the 3 dorbitals ( l=2).
Electrons do not start occupying 3 dorbitals until the 4 sorbital is
ﬁlled. Therefore, the 3 dorbitals are ﬁlled starting in period 4. The reason
for this change in the expected orbital ﬁlling order is that the 4 sorbital
has a lower energy than the 3 dorbitals. Remember that usually you ﬁll
orbitals in order of increasing energy. (If necessary, refer to the Guidelinesfor “Filling ” Orbitals and Figure 3.19 to refresh your memory.)
The chart below shows electron con ﬁgurations and partial orbital
diagrams for the 18 elements of period 4. You would expect the ﬁlling
pattern shown for potassium ( Z=19) through vanadium ( Z=23).
However, an unexpected deviation from the pattern occurs with chromi-um ( Z=24). The same thing happens with copper ( Z=29). All other
conﬁgurations for period 4 conform to the aufbau principle.
Why do Cr and Cu have electron con ﬁgurations that are different from
what you would predict? The guidelines that you have been using statethat you ﬁll orbitals according to increasing energy. In most cases, this
results in the most stable ground state con ﬁguration for the atom.
Experimental evidence indicates, however, that some atoms achievegreater stability with electron con ﬁgurations that do not conform to
predicted patterns. For chromium, the greatest ground state stabilityresults from a con ﬁguration in which its 4 sand 3 dorbitals are half- ﬁlled.
For copper, a half- ﬁlled 4 sorbital and a completely ﬁlled set of 3 dorbitals
gives the most stable con ﬁguration. Similar situations arise for a number
of atoms in the remaining periods.

Electron Con ﬁgurations and the Periodic Table
So far, you have “built up ” atoms of the ﬁrst 36 elements of the periodic
table. There are more than 80 elements still remaining. You do not, however, have to build up atoms of these elements to write their electronconﬁgurations. You can do it simply by consulting the periodic table!
All you need is to recognize the signi ﬁcance of several patterns. You have
already observed many of these.
In the process of examining the patterns outlined below, you will
learn the ﬁlling order for atoms of elements in periods 5, 6, and 7. You
will also see why the shape and organization of the periodic table is adirect consequence of the electronic structure of the atoms.
Arranging Elements by Electron Con ﬁgurations
Figure 3.21 on the next page shows the entire periodic table, with certain
segments colour-coded and labelled according to the type of orbital that is being ﬁlled. If you built up an atom of every element, ﬁlling orbitals in
order of increasing energy, you would construct a chart with precisely this
shape and organization. Figure 3.22 highlights the ﬁlling order, and there-
fore the energy order, of the orbitals when you read the periodic tablefrom left to right.
Elements that appear in the s block and the pblock are called either
the main group elements or the representative elements . Chemists give
them these names because, collectively, these elements are representativeof a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Among the maingroup elements, for example, you will ﬁnd metals, non-metals, metalloids, [Ar]4 s23d3[1s22s22p63s23p6]4s23d3V Z = 23

148 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and Propertieshighly reactive elements, moderately reactive elements, and unreactive
elements. While most main group elements are solids at room tempera-ture, roughly one quarter of them are gases, and one is a liquid.
Elements that appear in the dblock are called the transition elements .
They mark the transition from the porbital ﬁlling order to the d orbital
ﬁlling order. By the same reasoning, the fblock elements are called
the inner transition elements , because they mark a transition from the
dorbital ﬁlling order to the forbital ﬁlling order.
Patterns Involving Group Numbers and Period Numbers
Elements in a group have similar chemical properties because they have
similar outer electron con ﬁgurations. That is, they have the same number
of valence electrons. This observation gives rise to three patterns that youcan deduce from the periodic table.
•For main group elements, the last numeral of the group number is the
same as the number of valence electrons. For example, phosphorus ingroup 15 has 5 valence electrons. Strontium in group 2 has 2 valenceelectrons. (If you use the roman-numeral system for numbering groups,the group number is the number of valence electrons.) The only exception to this pattern is helium (group 18), which has only twovalence electrons. Nevertheless, helium ’s outermost occupied energy
level is complete with two electrons.
•The nvalue of the highest occupied energy level is the period number.
For example, atoms of elements that have electrons with n=3appear
in period 3. Atoms of elements that have electrons with n=6appear in
period 6.
•The square of the nvalue ( n
2) equals the total number of orbitals in
that energy level. Furthermore, since each orbital may have a maximumof two electrons, the maximum number of electrons in any principleenergy level is 2n
2. For example, with n=2, there are four orbitals: one
2sorbital and three 2 porbitals. Squaring the nvalue gives 22=4. The
total number of electrons in this energy level is eight , given by 2n2.
Notice that there are eight elements in period 2. This is no coincidence.
Compare this result with the next period. Does the pattern hold? Forperiod 3 elements, n=3. The number of orbitals is n
2=9. (Verify that
for yourself.) The number of electrons is 2n2=18. However, there are
only eight elements in period 3 . Why? The 4 sorbital has a lower energy
than the 3 porbitals, and thus ﬁlls ﬁrst. The 3 dorbitals ﬁll after the 4 s
orbitals. Therefore, there are 18 elements in period 4. Recall that the 4 f
orbitals do not ﬁll until after the 6 sorbital ﬁlls.3s2s

Summarizing Characteristics of s, p, d, and fBlock Elements
The sblock includes hydrogen, helium, and the elements of groups
1 (IA) and 2 (IIA). Valence electrons occupy only the nsorbitals
in this block. Hydrogen atoms and atoms of group 1 have partially ﬁlled
sorbitals, represented by the general electron con ﬁguration ns1. Helium
and atoms of group 2 elements have sorbitals ﬁlled with the maximum
number of valance electrons, represented by the general notation ns2.
Because sorbitals can hold a total of two electrons, the sblock elements
span two groups.
The pblock includes elements of groups 13 (IIIA) through 18 (VIIIA).
Electron con ﬁgurations of the pblock atoms take the general form ns2npa,
where arepresents a value ranging from 1 to 6. Because the three porbitals
can hold a maximum of six electrons, the pblock elements span six groups.
Unique among the pblock elements are the atoms of group 18 (VIIIA)
elements: the noble gases, renowned for their chemical stability. Theirelectron con ﬁguration takes the general form ns
2np6, representing a
ground state outer energy level with fully occupied sand porbitals. The
stability of this con ﬁguration is a key factor that drives the formation of
chemical bonds.
The dblock includes all the transition elements. In general, atoms of
dblock elements have ﬁlled nsorbitals, as well as ﬁlled or partially ﬁlled
dorbitals. Generally, the nsorbitals ﬁll before the (n−1)dorbitals.
However, there are exceptions (such as chromium and copper) becausethese two sublevels are very close in energy, especially at higher values of n. Because the ﬁve dorbitals can hold a maximum of ten electrons, the
dblock spans ten groups.
The fblock includes all the inner transition elements. Atoms of
fblock elements have ﬁlled sorbitals in the outer energy levels, as
well as ﬁlled or partially ﬁlled 4 fand 5 forbitals. In general, the notation
for the orbital ﬁlling sequence is ns, followed by (n−2)f, followed by
(n−1)d, followed by (for period 6 elements) np. However, there are
many exceptions that make it dif ﬁcult to predict electron con ﬁgurations.
Because there are seven forbitals, with a maximum of fourteen electrons,
the fblock spans fourteen groups.

As you know, atoms are not solid spheres. Their volumes (the extent of
their orbitals) are described in terms of probabilities. Nevertheless, thesize of an atom —its atomic radius —is a measurable property. Chemists
can determine it by measuring the distance between the nuclei of bonded,neighbouring atoms. For example, for metals, atomic radius is half the distance between neighbouring nuclei in a crystal of the metal element.For elements that occur as molecules, which is the case for many non-metals, atomic radius is half the distance between nuclei of identicalatoms that bonded together with a single covalent bond. In Figure 3.23,the radii of metallic elements represent the radius of an atom in a metalliccrystal. The radii of all other elements represent the radius of an atom ofthe element participating in a single covalent bond with one additional,like atom.

98Period
Figure 3.23 shows the periodic trends associated with the atomic
radius. You can see that atomic radii generally decrease across a period.Furthermore, atomic radii generally increase down a group. Two factorsaffect differences in atomic radii.
One factor affecting atomic radii is changing n. As nincreases, there
is a higher probability of ﬁnding electrons farther from their nucleus.
Therefore, the atomic volume is larger. In other words, atomic radiustends to increase with increasing n, and decrease with decreasing n.
The other factor that affects atomic radii is changing nuclear charge —
speci ﬁcally, the effective nuclear charge. Effective nuclear charge is the
netforce of attraction between electrons and the nucleus they surround.
Only hydrogen ’s single electron experiences the full positive charge of
its nucleus. For hydrogen, the nuclear charge experienced by the electronis Z, its atomic number. For all other atoms, the nuclear charge that any
given electron experiences is offset to some degree by other electrons.Depending on the electron density between the nucleus and any particular electron, the net force of attraction —the effective nuclear
charge, Z
eff—may be large or small.
As Zeffincreases, electrons are attracted more strongly to the nucleus,
and the size of the atom decreases. As Zeffdecreases, electrons experience
a reduced force of attraction, and the size of the atom increases. Valenceelectrons, especially, experience a smaller Z
effthan inner electrons
because the inner electrons shield or screen them from the attractive forceof the nucleus.
For the main group elements, the combined in ﬂuences of n, Z
eff, and
this shielding effect have the following outcomes.
•ngoverns the trend of increasing atomic radius down a group. Down a
group, atoms of each subsequent element have one more level of innerelectrons, increasing the shielding effect. Because of the additionalshielding, Z
efffor the valence electrons changes only slightly. The
increase in atomic size, therefore, results from the increasing value of n.
•Zeffgoverns the trend of decreasing atomic radius across a period.
Across a period, atoms of each element have one more electron added to the same outer energy level —ndoes not change. The shielding effect
changes only slightly. However, Z
effchanges considerably. The decrease
in atomic size across a period, therefore, results from increasing Zeff.
The atoms of transition elements do not display the same general trend as
the main group elements. A key reason for this is that electrons are addedto inner energy levels —the dorbitals —rather than to the outer energy
levels. As a result, Z
effchanges relatively little, so atomic size remains
fairly constant. In later chemistry courses, you will learn a more completeexplanation for the atomic radii of transition-element atoms.
Periodic Trends in Ionization Energy
For the hydrogen atom, the difference in energy between n=1and n=∞
represents the energy change associated with the complete removal of its
electron. (By convention, when n=∞, an electron is considered to be
completely removed from its atom.) The energy needed to completelyremove one electron from a ground state gaseous atom is called the ionization energy . Energy must be added to the atom to remove an
electron in order to overcome the force of attraction exerted on the electron by the nucleus. Since multi-electron atoms have two or moreelectrons, they also have more than one ionization energy.
Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 153
154 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesA gaseous atom ’s ﬁrst ionization energy is the least energy required to
remove an electron from the outermost occupied energy level. The secondionization energy is always greater than the ﬁrst ionization energy,
because the electron must be removed from a positively charged ion. Thesame reasoning applies for successive ionization energies.
First ionization energy ( IE
1) is closely linked to an atom ’s chemical
reactivity. Atoms with a low IE1tend to form cations during chemical reac-
tions. Notice in Figure 3.24 that the atoms with the lowest IE1are those
belonging to group 1 elements. These elements, also known as the alkalimetals, are among the most reactive elements in the periodic table. Atomsof elements with high IE
1tend to form anions: negatively charged ions.
(A notable exception is the noble gases, which do not form ions naturally.)
Figure 3.24 illustrates several trends associated with ionization energy.
•Ionization energy generally decreases down a group. Notice that this
trend is the inverse of the trend for atomic radius. The two trends are, in fact, linked. As atomic radius increases, the distance of valence electrons from the nucleus also increases. There is a decrease, therefore,in the force of attraction exerted by the nucleus on the valence electrons. Thus, less energy is needed to remove one such electron.
•Ionization energy generally increases across a period. Again, this trend
is linked to the atomic radius. Across a period, the atomic radiusdecreases because Z
effincreases. The force of attraction between the
nucleus and valence electrons is subsequently increased. Therefore,more energy is needed to remove one such electron.
Several minor variations in these trends occur. The variations involve
boron and aluminum in group 13 (IIIA) and oxygen and sulfur in group 16(VIA). The drop in IE
1with group 13 occurs because electrons start to ﬁll
the nporbitals. These orbitals are higher in energy than the nsorbital, so
the additional electron is more easily removed. Group 16 marks the ﬁrst
pairing of the porbital electrons. The np3conﬁguration of nitrogen is
more stable than the np4conﬁguration of oxygen. Electron repulsions10 20 30 40 50 60 70 8005001000150020002500

increase the orbital energy in oxygen. Therefore, less energy is required to
remove the fourth psublevel electron in oxygen.
Periodic trends in ionization energy are linked to trends involving the
reactivity of metals. In general, the chemical reactivity of metals increasesdown a group and decreases across a period. These trends, as well as afurther trend from metallic to non-metallic properties across a period, andincreasing metallic properties down a group, are shown in Table 3.1.

156 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesPeriodic Trends in Electron Af ﬁnity
Electron afﬁnity is the change in energy that occurs when an electron is
added to a gaseous atom. As was the case with ionization energy, there ismore than one value for electron af ﬁnity. The ﬁrst electron af ﬁnity results
in the formation of an anion with a charge of 1 −. For example, when a
neutral ﬂuorine atom acquires an electron, as in a bonding situation,
the resulting electron con ﬁguration of the ﬂuoride ion is the same as that
of the noble gas, neon:
F( 1s
22s22p5)+e−→F−(1s22s22p6)∆E=EA1
Fluorine is a highly reactive element. The relative ease with which
it gains an electron when it forms bonds is re ﬂected in its high
electron af ﬁnity.
Electron af ﬁnities for the main group elements. Negative values mean that
anions form with the release of energy. Positive values mean that energy is absorbed in orderto form the anion. The positive values are estimated, because the anions formed for atoms ofgroups 2 and 18 are unstable.
Figure 3.25 shows electron af ﬁnities for atoms of the main group ele-
ments. Positive values mean that energy is required to add an electron.Negative values mean that energy is given off when an electron is added.High negative numbers mean a high electron af ﬁnity. Low negative num-
bers and positive numbers mean a low electron af ﬁnity.
Trends for electron af ﬁnity are more irregular than those for atomic
radius and ionization energy, because factors other than atomic size and
Z
effare involved. In future chemistry courses, you will learn about these
factors and how they explain the irregularities. However, the property ofelectron af ﬁnity is still signi ﬁcant when you consider it in combination
with ionization energy. The trends that result from this combination areimportant for chemical bonding.
•Atoms of elements in group 17 (VIIA), and to a lesser degree group 16
(VIA), have high ionization energies and high electron af ﬁnities. As
a result, it takes a great deal of energy to remove electrons from theseatoms. However, these atoms attract electrons strongly, and form negative ions in ionic compounds.Figure 3.251

•Atoms of elements in group 1 (IA) and group 2 (IIA) have low ionization
energies and low electron af ﬁnities. Atoms of these elements give up
electrons easily, but attract them poorly. Therefore, they form positiveions in ionic compounds.
•Atoms of elements in group 18 (VIIIA) have very high ionization ener-
gies and very low electron af ﬁnities. Therefore, in nature, they do not
gain, give up or share electrons at all. (Under laboratory conditions,only the larger group 18 atoms can be made to form compounds.)
Section Summary
In this section, you have seen how a theoretical idea, the quantummechanical model of the atom, explains the experimentally determinedstructure of the periodic table, and the properties of its elements. Yourunderstanding of the four quantum numbers enabled you to write electronconﬁgurations and draw orbital diagrams for atoms of the elements. You
also learned how to “read” the periodic table to deduce the electron con-
ﬁguration of any element.
Since the start of high school science courses, you have used the
periodic table to help you investigate the composition and behaviour ofthe elements. Your early experiences with the periodic table were limitedlargely to the ﬁrst 20 elements, because you could explain their electron
structure without the concepts of orbitals and electron con ﬁgurations.
The modern, quantum mechanical model of the atom has broadened your understanding of the elements, the composition of their atoms, and their chemical and physical behaviour in the world around you. You will draw upon these concepts in the next chapter, as you expandyour understanding of the forces that are responsible for the millions ofkinds of matter in the universe: chemical bonds.

Chapter 3  Atoms, Electrons, and Periodic Trends • MHR 161
Awater molecule has a bent shape, while a carbon dioxide molecule
is linear. An ammonia molecule looks like a pyramid, and sulfur hexaﬂuoride (one of the most dense and most stable gaseous compounds)is shaped like an octahedron. In fact, all molecules in nature have a speciﬁc shape, which is important to their chemistry.
Why does the shape of a molecule matter? To answer this question,
consider that, right now, each nerve cell in your brain is communicatingwith adjacent nerve cells by releasing molecules called neurotransmittersfrom one cell to the next. Enzymes are assisting in the chemical break-down of food in your digestive system. The aroma of cologne, desk wood,or cleansers that you may be smelling is a result of odorous moleculesmigrating from their sources to speciﬁc sites in your nasal passages.
Each of these situations depends on the ability of one molecule with a
speciﬁc shape to “ﬁt” into a precise location with a corresponding shape.The properties of substances derive from the ways in which particlesbond together, the forces that act within and among the compounds theyform, and the shapes that result from these interactions.
In this chapter, you will review and extend your understanding of
chemical bonding. You will discover how and why each molecule has acharacteristic shape, and how molecular shape is linked to the propertiesof substances. You will also consider the importance of molecular shapeto the development of materials with speciﬁc applications in the worldaround you.

Specific Expectations  4.1Chemical Bonding
Of the more than one hundred elements that occur in nature or that have
been produced synthetically, only the noble gases exist naturally as single,uncombined atoms. The atoms of all other elements occur in some combined form, bonded together. Chemical bonds are electrostatic forces
that hold atoms together in compounds.
Why, however, do atoms form bonds at all? The answer to this
question involves energy. In nature, systems of lower energy tend to befavoured over systems of higher energy. In other words, lower-energy
systems tend to have greater stability than higher-energy systems . Bonded
atoms, therefore, tend to have lower energy than single, uncombinedatoms.
Using Lewis Structures to Represent Atoms in Chemical Bonding
Chemical bonding involves the interaction of valence electrons—the electrons that occupy the outermost principal energy level of an atom. You have used Lewis structures in previous studies to indicate thevalence electrons of atoms. Recall that to draw the Lewis structure of anatom, replace its nucleus and inner electrons with its atomic symbol.Then add dots around the atomic symbol to symbolize the atom’s valenceelectrons. Many chemists place the dots starting at the top and continueadding dots clockwise, at the right, then bottom, then left. After you havedrawn the ﬁrst four dots, you begin again at the top, as shown below.
In this chapter, you will use Lewis structures often to represent

Drawing aLewis structure for a molecule lets you see exactly how many electronsare involved in each bond, and helps you to keep track of the number ofvalence electrons. In the example below, notice that there are two ways to show the bonding pairs of electrons. Some chemists use dots only.Other chemists show the bonding pairs as lines between atoms. Dots arereserved for representing a lone pair (a non-bonding pair) of electrons.
You will see the second example, with lines for bonding pairs, used moreoften in this textbook.

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 165Ionic Bonding
The force of attraction between oppositely charged ions (cations and
anions) constitutes an ionic bond. Ionic bonding occurs between atoms of elements that have large differences in electronegativity — usually a
metal with a very low electronegativity and a non-metal with a very highelectronegativity. The units of ionic compounds such as sodium chlorideand magnesium ﬂuoride cannot be separated easily by direct heating of the
crystal salts. The ions that make up the ionic solid are arranged in a specif-ic array of repeating units. In solid sodium chloride, for example, the ionsare arranged in a rigid lattice structure. In such systems, the cations andanions are arranged so that the system has the minimum possible energy.
Because of the large differences in electronegativity, the atoms in an
ionic compound usually come from the sblock metals and the pblock
non-metals. For example, magnesium in Group 2 (IIA) and ﬂuorine in
Group 17 (VIIA) combine to form the ionic compound magnesium ﬂuoride, MgF
2. Figure 4.1 shows a repeating unit in the crystal model
of magnesium ﬂuoride. The process that results in the formation of ions
can be illustrated with an orbital diagram or with Lewis structures, asshown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. Use them as a guide for the PracticeProblems below. Through bonding, the atoms of each element obtain avalence electron con ﬁguration like that of the nearest noble gas. In this
case, the nearest noble gas for both ions is neon. This observation re ﬂects
the octet rule.

Properties of Ionic Solids
Magnesium ﬂuoride has many properties that are characteristic of ionic
solids. In general, ionic solids have the following properties:
•crystalline with smooth, shiny surfaces
•hard but brittle
•non-conductors of electricity and heat
•high melting points
Many ionic solids are also soluble in water. Magnesium ﬂuoride, however,
is an exception. It has a very low solubility in water.
Lattice Energy and Ionic Bonding
The reaction between gaseous magnesium ions and gaseous ﬂuorine ions
is highly exothermic. Chemists have determined that 2957 kJ of energy isreleased when 1 mol of Mg
2+(g)and 2 mol of F−(g)react to form 1 mol of
the stable ionic solid, MgF 2.
The amount of energy given off when an ionic crystal forms from the
gaseous ions of its elements is called the lattice energy . Thus, the lattice
energy of MgF 2is 2957 kJ/mol. The same amount of energy must be
added to break the ionic crystal back into its gaseous ions. What is therelationship between lattice energy and the formation of an ionic bond?For example, when solid magnesium and gaseous ﬂuorine react to form
magnesium ﬂuoride, the energy change is 1123 kJ/mol. How does this
energy change relate to magnesium ﬂuoride ’s lattice energy of 2957 kJ/mol?
Remember that, in general, the lower the total energy of a system is,
the higher is its stability. Any process that requires the addition of energyusually decreases the stability of the ionic arrangement. Any process that gives off energy usually increases that stability. Ionic crystals such as magnesium ﬂuoride have very high melting points. This means that a
large amount of energy is required to break the bonds that hold the ionstogether in their rigid lattice structure. You might wonder if this energycomes from the process of ionization. However, this is not the case. Theionization energy of the metal is always larger than the electron af ﬁnity of
the non-metal. In other words, the transfer of electrons between gaseousions always requires energy. In fact, it is the lattice energy given off (2957 kJ/mol for MgF
2) that favours the formation of ionic bonds.
For magnesium ﬂuoride, the overall decrease in energy of 1123 kJ/mol
is accounted for mainly by its large lattice energy. The lattice energies of the magnesium halides decrease from ﬂuoride to iodide. The melting
points of these halides reveal a trend in the same direction, with magne-sium ﬂuoride having the highest melting point and magnesium iodide
having the lowest melting point. In other words, the compound with thelargest lattice energy has the highest melting point —it requires the most
energy to disrupt the lattice structure.

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 167Covalent Bonding
Covalent bonding involves a balance between the forces of attraction
and repulsion that act between the nuclei and electrons of two or more atoms. This idea is represented in Figure 4.4, with a molecule ofhydrogen, H
2. There is an optimum separation for two hydrogen atoms
at which their nucleus-electron attractions, nucleus-nucleus repulsions,and electron-electron repulsions achieve this balance. This optimum separation favours a minimum energy for the system, and constitutes thecovalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms. Unlike ionic bonding, in which electrons behave as if they are transferred from one atom toanother, covalent bonding involves the sharing of pairs of electrons.
In Chapter 3 you learned how the quantum mechanical model applies
to the atom. The model can also be extended to explain bonding. A covalent bond may form when two half- ﬁlled atomic orbitals from two
atoms overlap to share the same region of space. A covalent bond involvesthe formation of a new orbital, caused by the overlapping of atomicorbitals. The new orbital has energy levels that are lower than those of the original atomic orbitals. Since electrons tend to occupy the lowestavailable energy level, the new orbitals provide a more energeticallyfavourable con ﬁguration than the two atoms had before they interacted.
Characteristics of Covalent Bonding
In many cases, electron-sharing enables each atom in a covalent bond to
acquire a noble gas con ﬁguration. For a hydrogen molecule, each atom
acquires a ﬁlled valence level like that of helium by treating the shared
pair of electrons as if it is part of its own composition. As you can see inFigure 4.5, a single shared pair of electrons —a bonding pair —ﬁlls the
valence level of both hydrogen atoms at the same time.
The period 2 non-metals from carbon to ﬂuorine must ﬁll their 2 sand
their three 2 porbitals to acquire a noble gas con ﬁguration like that of
neon. Covalent bonding that involves these elements obeys the octet rule.In the formation of the diatomic ﬂuorine molecule, F
2, for example, the
bonding (shared) pair of electrons gives each ﬂuorine atom a complete
valence level.
Each ﬂuorine atom also has three unshared pairs of electrons. These
pairs of electrons, called lone pairs , are not involved in bonding.
The covalent bond that holds molecules of hydrogen, ﬂuorine, and
hydrogen ﬂuoride together is a single bond. It involves a single bonding
pair of electrons. Some molecules are bonded together with two sharedpairs of electrons. These are called double bonds. Carbon dioxide is anexample of a covalent molecule that consists of double bonds.
Molecules that are bonded with three shared pairs of electrons have
triple bonds. Nitrogen, N
2, another diatomic molecule, is a triple-bonded
molecule.

and ﬂuorine are highly reactive, and readily bondtogether to form molecules of hydrogen ﬂuoride. Draw aLewis structure for hydrogenﬂuoride. Label the bonding and lone pairs, and explainwhy this molecule is stable.
Bond energy is the energy required to break the force of attraction
between two atoms in a bond and to separate them. Thus, bond energy is a measure of the strength of a bond. You might expect that the bondenergy would increase if more electrons were shared between two atomsbecause there would be an increase in charge density between the nucleiof the bonded atoms. In other words, you might predict that double bondsare stronger than single bonds, and that triple bonds are stronger thandouble bonds. The data in Table 4.1 support this prediction.
Table 4.1 Average Bond Energies of Bonds
Between Carbon Atoms and Between Nitrogen Atoms
Predicting Ionic and Covalent Bonds
There are several methods you can use to predict the type of bond in
an unknown substance. For example, you can consider the substance ’s
physical properties. In contrast to ionic solids, covalent (molecular) compounds typically have the following properties:
•exist as a soft solid, a liquid, or a gas at room temperature
•have low melting points and boiling points
•are poor conductors of electricity, even in solution
•may not be soluble in water (acetone, however, is one of many
exceptions; you will ﬁnd out why shortly)
What if you know the formula of a compound but don ’t know how
to classify it? In this case, you can use the electronegativity differencebetween the bonding atoms to predict the type of bond. For example, two atoms with identical electronegativities, such as chlorine(∆EN=3.16 −3.16 =0) share their electrons equally. They are bonded
covalently. When two atoms have very different electronegativities, theatom with the higher electronegativity value attracts electrons morestrongly than the atom with the lower electronegativity value. In sodiumchloride, for instance, chlorine ( EN=3.16) attracts an electron much
more strongly than sodium ( EN=0.93). Therefore, sodium ’s valence
electron has a very high probability of being found near chlorine, and avery low probability of being found near sodium. A high electronegativitydifference is characteristic of ionic compounds.
It is common for chemists to describe the formation of ionic
compounds in terms of a transferring of electrons from one atom to another. For example, in the formation of sodium chloride, you often read that sodium loses its valence electron and that chlorine gains an electron. Terms such as these —electron transfer, losing electrons, gaining
electrons —make it easier to discuss and model the behaviour of atoms
during ionic bonding and the formation of ionic compounds. Figure 4.6provides a guide to classifying chemical bonds based on their electronega-tivity difference. Notice that this “bonding continuum, ” as it is sometimes
called, avoids de ﬁnitive classi ﬁcations. Instead, the character of chemical
bonds changes gradually with ∆EN.Bond Bond energy (kJ/mol) Bond energy (kJ/mol) Bond

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 169Chemists consider bonded atoms with ∆ENbetween 0 and 0.4 as
being mostly covalent; electrons are shared equally or nearly equally.
For bonded atoms that have ∆ENbetween 0.4 and 1.7, the bond is
termed polar covalent. A polar covalent bond is a covalent bond with
an unequally shared pair of electrons between two atoms. This unequalsharing results in a bond that has partially positive and partially negativepoles. (You will learn about the signi ﬁcance of molecular polarity in
section 4.2.) Bonded atoms with ∆ENbetween 1.7 and 3.3 are mostly
ionic; electrons are shared so unequally that one bonded atom has astrong negative charge and the other has a strong positive charge.
The gradual change in the magnitude of ∆ENbetween two atoms
is paralleled by a gradual change in the physical properties of the com-pounds they form. For example, chlorine forms compounds with each ofthe main-group elements of period 3, except for argon. Figure 4.7 showsthe relationship between ∆ENand the bonding, structure, and properties

Metallic Bonding
About two-thirds of all the naturally occurring elements are metals.
Despite this great diversity, metals have many properties in common.Metals conduct electricity and heat in both their solid and liquid states.Most metals are malleable and ductile; that is, they can be easily stretched,bent, and deformed without shattering of the whole solid, or can be easilymade to be with the addition of heat or pressure. While metals show abroad range of melting and boiling points, in general, metals change stateat moderate to high temperatures. Most metals have either one or twovalence electrons. What kind of bonding model can account for theseproperties?
Based on electronegativity differences, you would not expect metals
to form ionic bonds with themselves or with other metals —and they do
not. Similarly, metals do not have a suf ﬁcient number of valence electrons
to form covalent bonds with one another. Metals do, however, share electrons. Unlike the electron sharing in covalent compounds, however,electron sharing in metals occurs throughout the entire structure of themetal. The free-electron model shown in Figure 4.8 pictures metals as
being composed of a densely packed core of metallic cations, within adelocalized region of shared, mobile valence electrons. The force of attraction between the positively charged cations and the pool of valenceelectrons that moves among them constitutes a metallic bond .
Properties Explained by the Free-Electron Model
The free-electron model explains many properties of metals. For example:•Conductivity: Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat because
electrons can move freely throughout the metallic structure. This freedomof movement is not possible in solid ionic compounds, because thevalence electrons are held within the individual ionic bonds in the lattice.
•Malleability and Ductility: The malleability of metals can be explained
by viewing metallic bonds as being non-directional. The positive ionsare often layered as ﬁxed arrays (like soldiers lined up for inspection).
When stress is applied to a metal, one layer of positive ions can slideover another layer. The layers move without breaking the array, which isthe reason why metals do not shatter immediately along a clearly

uniform attraction on the positive ions, as you can see in Figure 4.9.
•Melting and Boiling Points: The melting and boiling points of Group 1
(IA) metals (with an s1electron in their condensed electron con ﬁgura-
tion) are generally lower than the melting and boiling points of Group 2(IIA) metals (with an s
2in their condensed electron con ﬁguration).
You would expect this trend, because the greater number of valenceelectrons and the larger positive charge of Group 2 (IIA) atoms result instronger metallic bonding forces. This trend is also consistent with thefact that Group 2 metals are smaller in size than Group 1 metals. Trendsinvolving the transition metals are more complex, in part because theyhave a greater number of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. Because
these delectrons and those of the valence energy level have similar
magnitudes, the delectrons can participate in metallic bonding. In
general, however, transition elements have very high melting and boiling points.
Section Summary

or between the two —result from the atomic structure and properties of
the bonding atoms. In the next section, you will learn how the positions ofatoms in a compound, and the arrangement of the bonding and lone pairsof electrons, produce molecules with characteristic shapes. These shapes,and the forces that arise from them, are intimately linked to the physicalproperties of substances, as you will see in the ﬁnal section of the chapter.

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 173Molecular Shape and Polarity
A molecule is a discrete chemical entity, in which atoms are held together
by the electrostatic attractions of covalent bonds. In previous chemistrycourses, you used Lewis structures to represent the bonding in simplemolecules. In a Lewis structure, you assume that each of the atoms in the molecule achieves a noble gas con ﬁguration through the sharing of
electrons in single, double, or triple bonds. This section introduces you to a systematic approach to drawing Lewis structures for a broader rangemolecules and for polyatomic ions. You will see that, in some cases, thereare exceptions to the octet rule. Afterwards, you will use bonding theoryto help you predict the shapes of various molecules. From the shapes ofthese molecules (and the electronegativity difference of their atoms), youwill determine the polarity of the substances that are comprised of thesemolecules.
Why is polarity important? It explains why, for example, water is a
liquid at room temperature, rather than a gas. In other words, it helpsexplain why Earth is capable of supporting life! You will explore the signi ﬁcance of molecular polarity in greater detail in section 4.3.
Lewis Structures for Molecules and Polyatomic Ions
You can use the procedure outlined below to draw the Lewis structures
for molecules and ions that have a central atom, with other atoms aroundit. The Sample Problems and additional text that follow show how toapply these steps for several molecules and polyatomic ions that obey theoctet rule. Afterwards, use Practice Problems 9 to 13 to practice drawingLewis structures.
How To Draw Lewis Structures for Simple Molecules and Ions with
a Central Atom
Step 1 Position the least electronegative atom in the centre of the
molecule or polyatomic ion. Write the other atoms around thiscentral atom, with each atom bonded to the central atom by asingle bond. Always place a hydrogen atom or a ﬂuorine atom
at an end position in the structure.
Step 2 (a) Determine the total number of valence electrons in the molecule or ion. For polyatomic ions, pay close attention to the charge. For example, if you are drawing a polyatomicanion such as CO
32−, add two electrons to the total number
of valence electrons calculated for the structure CO3. For a
polyatomic cation such as NH 4+, subtract one electron from
the total number of valence electrons calculated for the structure NH
4.
(b)Once you have the total number of valence electrons,
determine the total number of electrons needed for each atom to achieve a noble gas electron con ﬁguration.
Problem
Draw the Lewis structure for formaldehyde (methanal), CH2O.
Solution
The molecular formula, CH2O, tells you the number of each kind
of atom in the molecule. Following steps 1 to 3 from the procedure outlined above:
Step 1 Since H is always placed at the end position and C is less
electronegative than O, C should be the central atom. Place the other atoms around C, attached by single bonds.
Step 2 Determine the total number of valence electrons:(1 C atom ×4e

+ (2 H atoms ×1e−/Hatom)
=4e−+6e−+2e−
=12 e−
Then, determine the total number of electrons required for each
atom in the structure to achieve a noble gas con ﬁguration. This
would be 8 e−for C and 8 e−for O (to ﬁll their respective valence
energy levels) and 2 e−for each H (to ﬁll its 1 sorbital). So the total
number for CH2Ois:
(2 atoms ×8e−/atom) +(2 atoms ×2e−/atom ) =20 e−
To ﬁnd the number of shared electrons, subtract the ﬁrst total
from the second,
20 e−−12 e−=8e−
Now divide the number of shared electrons by two to obtain the
number of bonds.
20 e−−12 e−=8e−÷2=4covalent bonds
Since there are only three atoms surrounding the central atom,
you can infer that one of the bonds is likely a double bond.CHO

Lewis Structures with a Co-ordinate Covalent BondCo-ordinate Covalent Bonds
You know that a covalent bond involves the sharing of a pair of electrons
between two atoms; each atom contributes one electron to the shared pair.In some cases, such as the hydronium ion, H
3O+, one atom contributes
both of the electrons to the shared pair. The bond in these cases is called a co-ordinate covalent bond . In terms of the quantum mechanical model, a
co-ordinate covalent bond forms when a ﬁlled atomic orbital overlaps with
an empty atomic orbital. Once a co-ordinate bond is formed, it behaves inthe same way as any other single covalent bond. The next Sample Probleminvolves a polyatomic ion with a co-ordinate covalent bond.Step 3 Determine the number of non-bonding electrons by subtracting
the number of shared electrons from the total number of valenceelectrons:12 valence electrons
−8 shared electrons

Note that the Lewis structure for NH 4+does notindicate which atom
provides each shared pair of electrons around the central nitrogen atom.However, the quantum mechanical model of the atom can explain thebonding around this nitrogen atom. The condensed electron con ﬁguration
for nitrogen is [Ne] 2s
22p3. Each nitrogen atom has only three unpaired
2pelectrons in three half- ﬁlled orbitals available for bonding. Since there
are four covalent bonds shown around nitrogen in the Lewis structure,electrons in one of the bonds must have come from the ﬁlled orbitals of
nitrogen. Therefore, one of the bonds around the central nitrogen atommust be a co-ordinate covalent bond.
Resonance Structures: More Than One Possible Lewis Structure
Imagine that you are asked to draw the Lewis structure for sulfur dioxide,
SO2. A typical answer would look like this:
This Lewis structure suggests that SO2contains a single bond and
a double bond. However, experimental measurements of bond lengthsindicate that the bonds between the S and each O are identical. The twobonds have properties that are somewhere between a single bond and adouble bond. In effect, the SO
2molecule contains two “one-and-a-half ”
bonds.
To communicate the bonding in SO2more accurately, chemists
draw two Lewis structures and insert a double-headed arrow betweenthem. Each of these Lewis structures is called a resonance structure.Resonance structures are models that give the same relative position of
atoms as in Lewis structures, but show different places for their bondingand lone pairs.

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 177Many molecules and ions —especially organic ones —require
resonance structures to represent their bonding. It is essential to bear in mind, however, that resonance structures do notexist in reality. For
example, SO
2does not shift back and forth from one structure to the
other. An actual SO2molecule is a combination —a hybrid —of its two
resonance structures. It is more properly referred to as a resonance hybrid .
You could think of resonance hybrids as being like “mutts. ” For example,
a dog that is a cross between a spaniel and a beagle (a “speagle ”) is part
spaniel and part beagle. It does not exist as a spaniel one moment and abeagle the next. Instead, a speagle is an average, of sorts, between the twobreeds. Similarly, a resonance hybrid is a weighted average between twoor more resonance structures.

Central Atoms with an Expanded Valence Level
The octet rule allows a maximum of four bonds (a total of eight electrons)
to form around an atom. Based upon bond energies, however, chemistshave suggested that the bonding in some molecules (and polyatomic ions)is best explained by a model that shows more than eight electrons in thevalence energy level of the central atom. This central atom is said to havean expanded valence energy level . One example of a molecule with an
expanded valence energy level is phosphorus pentachloride, PCl
5. This
substance is a pungent, pale-yellow powder that is used in the agricultural,pharmaceutical, and dyeing industries. Organic chemists also use reactionswith PCl

Assume that the octet rule usually applies
when drawing Lewis structures for simple molecules. Sometimes, however, you must violate the rule to allow for more than four bondsaround a central atom.
178 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesShapes and Polarity of Molecules
Up to now, you have represented molecules using Lewis structures.
These two-dimensional, formula-like diagrams help you count and keeptrack of valence electrons, and communicate essential information aboutthe placement and bonding of atoms or ions in a molecule. Chemists oftendraw Lewis structures in a way that suggests the shape of a molecule.However, this is not their function. It is important to remember that Lewisstructures do notcommunicate any information about a molecule ’s shape.
To represent the shapes of real molecules, you need a model that depictsthem in three-dimensions.
In 1957, an English chemist, Ronald Gillespie, joined Hamilton,
Ontario ’s McMaster University for a long, distinguished career as a
professor of chemistry. Earlier that year, Gillespie, in collaboration with a colleague, Ronald Nyholm, developed a model for predicting the shapeof molecules. Like chemistry students around the world since that time,you are about to learn the central features of this model, called theValence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion theory. This is usually abbreviatedto VSEPR (pronounced “vesper ”) theory. (Note that some chemists use the
term “shell ” instead of energy level to describe atomic orbitals.)
Introducing Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory
The fundamental principle of the Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion
theory is that the bonding pairs and lone, non-bonding pairs of electrons
in the valence level of an atom repel one another. As you know, electronpairs of atoms are localized in orbitals, which are shapes that describe thespace in which electrons are most likely to be found around a nucleus.The orbital for each electron pair is positioned as far apart from the otherorbitals as possible.
Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 179The effect of this positioning minimizes the forces of repulsion
between electron pairs. A lone pair (LP) will spread out more than a bondpair. Therefore, the repulsion is greatest between lone pairs (LP
/H11002LP).
Bonding pairs (BP) are more localized between the atomic nuclei, so theyspread out less than lone pairs. Therefore, the BP-BP repulsions are smallerthan the LP
/H11002LP repulsions. The repulsion between a bond pair and a
lone-pair (BP /H11002LP) has a magnitude intermediate between the other two.
In other words, in terms of decreasing repulsion:
LP/H11002LP > LP /H11002BP > BP /H11002BP.
In Unit 1, you encountered the tetrahedral shape around a single-
bonded carbon atom, the trigonal planar shape around a carbon atom with one double bond, and the linear shape around a carbon atom with a triple bond. These shapes result from repulsions between lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons. Now you will use your understanding ofLP and BP repulsions to explain the shapes you learned in Unit 1, and to predict the shapes of other molecules. Figure 4.11 shows the ﬁve basic
geometrical arrangements that result from the interactions of lone pairsand bonding pairs around a central atom. These arrangements involve upto six electron groups. An electron group is usually one of the following:
•a single bond
•a double bond
•a triple bond
•a lone pair
Each of the electron-group arrangements in Figure 4.11 results in a
minimum total energy for the molecule. Variations in these arrangementsare possible, depending on whether a bonding pair or a lone pair occupiesa speci ﬁc position. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
electron-group arrangement and molecular shape . Electron-group
arrangement refers to the ways in which groups of valence electrons are positioned around the central atom. Molecular shape refers to the relative positions of the atomic nuclei in a molecule. When all the
electron groups are bonding pairs, a molecule will have one of the ﬁvegeometrical arrangements shown in Figure 4.11 .If one or more of the
electron groups include a lone pair of electrons ,variations in one of the
ﬁve geometric arrangements result .

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 181Molecular Geometry
Each of the molecules in Figure 4.12 has four pairs of electrons around
the central atom. Observe the differences in the number of bonding andlone pairs in these molecules. Methane, CH
4, has four BPs. Ammonia,
NH 3, has three BPs and one LP. Water, H2O, has two BPs and two LPs.
Notice the effect of these differences on the shapes and bond angles of the molecules. Methane, with four BPs, has a molecular shape that is thesame as the electron-group arrangement in which four electron groupssurround a central atom: tetrahedral. The angle between any two bondingpairs in the tetrahedral electron-group arrangement is 109.5 ˚. This angle
corresponds to the most favourable arrangement of electron groups tominimize the forces of repulsion among them.
Comparing the bond angles in the molecules of CH 4, NH 3, and H2O.
When there are 1 LP and 3 BPs around a central atom, there are two
types of repulsions: LP /H11002BP and BP /H11002BP. Since LP /H11002BP repulsions are
greater than BP /H11002BP repulsions, the bond angle between the bond pairs
in NH 3is reduced from 109.5 ˚ to 107.3 ˚. When you draw the shape of a
trigonal pyramidal molecule, without the lone pair, you can see that thethree bonds form the shape of a pyramid with a triangular base. In a molecule of H
2O, there are two BPs and two LPs. The strong LP /H11002LP
repulsions, in addition to the LP /H11002BP repulsions, cause the angle
between the bonding pairs to be reduced further to 104.5 ˚. You encoun-
tered this variation of the tetrahedral shape in Unit 1: the bent shapearound an oxygen atom with 2 LPs and two single bonds.
Table 4.2 summarizes the molecular shapes that commonly occur. The
VSEPR notation used for these shapes adopts the letter “A” to represent
the central atom, the letter “X” to represent a bonding pair, and the letter
“E’ to represent a lone pair of electrons. For example, the VSEPR notation
for NH
3is AX 3E. This indicates that ammonia has three BPs around its
central atom, and one LP.Figure 4.12

AIM Theory and Electron
Density Maps
The microscopic world of atoms is dif ﬁcult to
imagine, let alone visualize in detail. Chemists andchemical engineers employ different molecularmodelling tools to study the structure, properties,and reactivity of atoms, and the way they bond toone another. Richard Bader, a chemistry professor atMcMaster University, has invented an interpretativetheory that is gaining acceptance as an accuratemethod to describe molecular behaviour and predictmolecular properties. According to Dr. Bader, shownbelow, small molecules are best represented usingtopological maps, where contour lines (which arecommonly used to represent elevation on maps)represent the electron density of molecules.
The diagrams above show two different ways to model the
electron density in a plane of a molecule of ethylene .In the early 1970s, Dr. Bader invented the
theory of “Atoms in Molecules, ” otherwise known
as AIM theory. This theory links the mathematics of quantum mechanics to the atoms and bonds in a molecule. AIM theory adopts electron density,which is related to the Schr ödinger description of
the atom, as a starting point to mapping molecules.
Chemists often focus on the energetic,
geometric, and spectroscopic properties of molecules. However, since the electron densityexists in ordinary three-dimensional space, electrondensity maps of molecules can be used as tools tounearth a wealth of information about the molecule.This information includes, but is not limited to, amolecule ’s magnetic properties, per-atom electron
population, and bond types.
Using diagrams and computer graphics, chemists
use AIM theory to construct three-dimensional electron density maps of molecules. Chemists canthen use the maps as tools to perform experimentson the computer as if they were performing the same experiments in the laboratory, but with higherefﬁciency. Many chemists are excited by the prospect
of using computer graphics, both inside and outsideof the classroom, as teaching tools for students andthe public at large.
In addition to being able to simulate very
simple isolated molecules and their reactions, AIM theory provides a physical basis for the theoryof Lewis electron pairs and the VSEPR model ofmolecular geometry. Equipped with computers andcomputer-generated, three-dimensional electrondensity maps, scientists are able to view moleculesand predict molecular phenomena without evenhaving to get off their chairs!

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 187The Relationship Between Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity
A molecule ’s shape and polarity are directly related. As you know, the
electronegativity difference between two atoms is the principal factor that determines the type of chemical bonding between them. As you sawin section 4.1, when atoms of two different elements have ∆ENbetween
0.5 and 1.7, the bond between them is polar covalent. The electrons areshared unequally between the two types of atoms. For example, in theHCl molecule, the Cl atom is more electronegative than the H atom. Thus,the Cl atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the shared pair of electrons. As a result, the Cl end of the bond develops a partial negativecharge ( δ
−) and the H end develops a partial positive charge ( δ+). This
polarity in a bond is called a bond dipole . The vector used to represent a
bond dipole points toward the more electronegative element. For exam-ple, you could represent the polarity of the bond in hydrogen chloride as:
For a diatomic molecule such as HCl, or the bond polarity is also the
molecule ’s polarity. For polyatomic molecules, such as the examples that
follow, molecular polarity depends on the polarity of all of the bonds andthe angles at which the dipoles come together. Thus, moleculardipole
/H11002or just dipole /H11002is a term used to describe the charge separation
for the entire molecule.
Consider, for example, BeF 2, which is a symmetrical, linear molecule.
Each Be /H11002F bond is polar (because ﬂuorine has a greater electronegativity
than beryllium). Due to the linear shape of this molecule, however, the polarities of the two bonds are directly opposite each other. The two bonding polarities exactly counteract each other, so that BeF
2is a
non-polar molecule. The shape of a molecule, combined with the polarityof its individual bonds, therefore, determine polarity.
Compare two molecules with the same molecular shape: CCl
4and
CCl 3H. Since the polarity of the C /H11002Cl bond is different from that of
the C/H11002H bond, the polarities of these two molecules are different. The
CCl 4molecule is symmetrical about any axis joining the two atoms of
the C/H11002Cl bond. The polarities of the C /H11002Cl bonds counteract one
another. Thus, the carbon tetrachloride molecule is non-polar. In the case of CCl
3H, the polarity of the H /H11002Cl bond is different from that of
the three C /H11002Cl bonds. Thus, the molecule is polar.

In this section, you have pieced together the main components that deter-
mine the structure and polarity of molecules. Why is the polarity of amolecule important? Polar molecules attract one another more than non-polar molecules do. Because of this attraction, many physical propertiesof substances are affected by the polarity of their molecules.

Intermolecular Forces
in Liquids and Solids
Water and hydrogen sul ﬁde have the same molecular shape: bent. Both
are polar molecules. However, H2O, with a molar mass of 18 g, is a liquid
at room temperature, while H2S, with a molar mass of 34 g, is a gas.
Water ’s boiling point is 100 ˚C, while hydrogen sul ﬁde’s boiling point
is −61˚C. These property differences are dif ﬁcult to explain using the
bonding models you have learned so far. These models focused on theforces of attraction between ions in ionic solids, between individual atomsin covalent and polar covalent compounds, and between positive metalions and free electrons in metals. These are intramolecular forces —forces
exerted within a molecule or polyatomic ion. During a chemical change,
intramolecular forces are overcome and chemical bonds are broken.Therefore, these forces in ﬂuence the chemical properties of substances.
Forces that in ﬂuence the physical properties of substances are called
intermolecular forces . These are forces of attraction and repulsion that act
between molecules or ions.
Intermolecular forces were extensively studied by the Dutch physicist
Johannes van der Waals (1837 –1923). To mark his contributions to the
understanding of intermolecular attractions, these forces are often calledvan der Waals forces. They are categorized into the following groups:dipole-dipole forces, ion-dipole forces, induced dipole forces, dispersion(London) forces, and hydrogen bonding. In the pages that follow, you willsee how each of these types of intermolecular forces affects the molecularproperties of liquids. Following that, you will apply your understandingof intermolecular forces to help you explain some physical properties ofsubstances in the solid state.
Dipole-Dipole Forces
In the liquid state, polar molecules (dipoles) orient themselves so thatoppositely charged ends of the molecules are near to one another. Theattractions between these opposite charges are called dipole-dipole forces .
Figure 4.13 shows the orientation of polar molecules due to these forcesin a liquid.

Specific Expectations
Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 191As a result of these dipole-dipole forces of attraction, polar molecules
will tend to attract one another more at room temperature than similarlysized non-polar molecules would. The energy required to separate polarmolecules from one another is therefore greater than that needed to sepa-rate non-polar molecules of similar molar mass. This is indicated by theextreme difference in melting and boiling points of these two types ofmolecular substances. (Recall that melting and boiling points are physicalproperties of substances.)
Ion-Dipole Forces
Sodium chloride and other soluble ionic solids dissolve in polar solventssuch as water because of ion-dipole forces. An ion-dipole force is the
force of attraction between an ion and a polar molecule (a dipole). Forexample, NaCl dissolves in water because the attractions between the Na
+
and Cl−ions and the water molecules provide enough energy to overcome
the forces that bind the ions together. Figure 4.14 shows how ion-dipoleforces dissolve any type of soluble ionic compound.
In aqueous solution, ionic solids dissolve as the negative ends and the positive
ends of the water molecules become oriented with the corresponding oppositely charged ionsthat make up the ionic compound, pulling them away from the solid into solution.
Induced Intermolecular Forces
Induction of electric charge occurs when a charge on one object causes a
change in the distribution of charge on a nearby object. Rubbing a balloonto make it "stick" to a wall is an example of charging by induction. Thereare two types of charge-induced dipole forces.
An ion-induced dipole force results when an ion in close proximity
to a non-polar molecule distorts the electron density of the non-polar molecule. The molecule then becomes momentarily polarized, and thetwo species are attracted to each other. This force is active during everymoment of your life, in the bonding between non-polar O
2molecules
and the Fe2+ion in hemoglobin. Ion-induced dipole forces, therefore, are
part of the process that transports vital oxygen throughout your body.
A dipole-induced dipole force is similar to that of an ion-induced
dipole force. In this case, however, the charge on a polar molecule isresponsible for inducing the charge on the non-polar molecule. Non-polargases such as oxygen and nitrogen dissolve, sparingly, in water because ofdipole-induced dipole forces.Figure 4.14

3CH2CH3, is

dipole-dipole forces to explainthese property differences.
Dispersion (London) Forces
The shared pairs of electrons in covalent bonds are constantly vibrating.
While this applies to all molecules, it is of particular interest for mole-cules that are non-polar. The bond vibrations, which are part of the normal condition of a non-polar molecule, cause momentary, uneven distributions of charge. In other words, a non-polar molecule becomesslightly polar for an instant, and continues to do this on a random but on-going basis. At the instant that one non-polar molecule is in a slightlypolar condition, it is capable of inducing a dipole in a nearby molecule.An intermolecular force of attraction results. This force of attraction iscalled a dispersion force . Chemists also commonly refer to it as a London
force, in honour of the German physicist, Fritz London, who studied this force. Unlike other intermolecular forces, dispersion (London) forces act between any particles, polar or otherwise. They are the mainintermolecular forces that act between non-polar molecules, as shown inFigure 4.15.
Two factors affect the magnitude of dispersion forces. One is the
number of electrons in the molecule and the other is the shape of the molecule. Vibrations within larger molecules that have more electronsthan smaller molecules can easily cause an uneven distribution of charge.The dispersion forces between these larger molecules are thus stronger,which has the effect of raising the boiling point for larger molecules. Amolecule with a spherical shape has a smaller surface area than a straightchain molecule that has the same number of electrons. The smaller surface area allows less opportunity for the molecule to induce a chargeon a nearby molecule. Therefore, for two substances with molecules thathave a similar number of electrons, the substance with molecules thathave a more spherical shape will have weaker dispersion forces and alower boiling point.
How dispersion forces develop between identical non-polar molecules. In A,
neither molecule interacts with the other. In B, one molecule becomes, instantaneously, adipole. At that moment, the dipolar molecule is able to induce a temporary charge separationin the other molecule, resulting in a force of attraction between the two. All the moleculeswithin a sample undergo this same process, as shown in C.
Hydrogen Bonding
A dipole-dipole interaction that is very signi ﬁcant in many biological
molecules and some inorganic molecules, such as H2O(/lscript), is hydrogen
bonding. Hydrogen bonding is a particularly strong form of dipole-dipole
attraction that exists between a hydrogen atom in a polar-bonded molecule that contains bonds such as H
/H11002O, H/H11002N, or H /H11002F, and an
unshared pair of electrons on another small, electronegative atom such as O, N, or F. The small, electronegative atom can be on its own, but isusually bonded in a molecule.Figure 4.15
C
BA
192 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and Properties
Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 193When hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, ﬂuorine, or nitrogen, the strong
force of attraction exerted by any of these three very electronegative atomsdraws the electron density from the hydrogen atom in the polar-bondedmolecule, leaving the hydrogen atom with a partial positive charge. Thisdipole is easily attracted to the partially negative lone pair on a nearbyelectronegative atom: N, O, or F.
You can see the effect of hydrogen bonding clearly in the boiling
point data of the binary hydrides of Groups 14 to 17 (IVA to VIIA), shownin Figure 4.16. In Group 14, the trend in boiling point is as expected. The increase in boiling point from methane, CH
4, to tin(IV) hydride,
SnH 4, is due to an increase in the number of electrons. Therefore, there
are larger dispersion forces, since more electrons are able to temporarilyshift from one part of the molecule to another. In SnH
4, this results in
greater intermolecular forces of attraction. There is no hydrogen bondingin these substances, because there are no lone pairs on the molecules.
However, the hydrides of Groups 15, 16, and 17 (VA to VIIA) only
show the expected trend based on dispersion forces for the larger masshydrides. The smallest mass hydrides, NH
3, H2O, and HF, have relatively
high boiling points, indicating strong intermolecular forces caused byhydrogen bonding.
Why is there no hydrogen bonding in H
2Sand H2Se, which have
unshared electron pairs on their central atoms? Neither S nor Se is smallenough or electronegative enough to support hydrogen bonding. Thus,
H
2O(with its small and very electronegative O atom) has a much higher
boiling point than H2Sand H2Se, as you can see in Figure 4.16.
The boiling points of four groups of hydrides. The break in the trends
for NH 3, H2O, and HF is due to hydrogen bonding. The dashed line shows the likely
boiling point of water, if no hydrogen bonding were present.
A hydrogen bond is only about 5% as strong as a single covalent
bond. However, in substances that contain numerous hydrogen bonds the impact of hydrogen bonding can be signi ﬁcant. For example, the
double-helix structure of DNA occurs because of hydrogen bonds, asshown in Figure 4.17. Another substance that contains many hydrogenbonds, water, is discussed on the following page.Figure 4.16−200−1000100

Hydrogen Bonding and Properties of Water
Hydrogen bonding also explains water ’s unusual property of being less
dense in the solid state than in the liquid state. As you know from kineticmolecular theory, lower temperatures cause liquid molecules to moveslower than in their gaseous states. When liquids solidify, the kineticenergy of the particles is no longer enough to prevent the intermolecularforces of attraction from causing particles to stick together. For most substances, their solid states are denser than their liquid states. Whenwater freezes, however, the water molecules pack in such a way that thesolid state is lessdense than the liquid state. Water molecules align in a
speci ﬁc pattern so that hydrogen atoms of one molecule are oriented
toward the oxygen atom of another molecule. You can see this clearly inFigure 4.18. If water molecules behaved as most molecules do, then lakewater would freeze from the bottom up, rather than from the top down.The consequences for aquatic life, and on organisms (like us) that dependon aquatic ecosystems, would be profound. A lake that freezes from thebottom up would solidify completely, killing most of the life it contains.Because ice ﬂoats on water, it insulates the water beneath it, preventing
it from freezing.
Hydrogen bonding also explains the solubility in water of polar
covalent compounds. As you learned in Unit 1, the O
/H11002H functional
group in alcohols is polar. Because of this polar group, alcohols can formhydrogen bonds with water molecules. Consequently, methanol andethanol are soluble in water in all proportions, and every alcohol is moresoluble than its corresponding alkane with the same number of carbonatoms. (Recall that alkanes do not have the O
/H11002H functional group.)
Ammonia, NH 3, is a very soluble gas because it hydrogen-bonds with
water. The smaller mass amines, such as methylamine, CH3NH 2, are also
soluble in water, for the same reason.
In its solid state, water has an open, hexagonal, crystalline structure. As a
result of these spaces, ice is less dense than liquid water. Figure 4.18

Bonding in Solids
In Investigation 4-A, you classi ﬁed solid substances on the basis of the
types of bonds that hold their molecules or ions together. This is not,however, the only way to classify solids. Chemists also divide solids into two categories based on the macroscopic properties that arise from the arrangements of their component particles. Crystalline solids
have organized particle arrangements, so they have distinct shapes.Gemstones such as amethyst and garnet are examples of crystalline solids. Amorphous solids have indistinct shapes, because their particle
arrangements lack order. Glass and rubber are common amorphous solids.In the next few pages, you will learn about the structure and properties of crystalline and amorphous solids.
Bonding and Properties of Crystalline Solids
Chemists further classify crystalline solids into ﬁve types, based on
their composition. These types are atomic, molecular, network, ionic, and metallic. Since you have already learned about metallic solids, thematerial that follows concentrates on the other four crystalline solids. You will ﬁnd a summary of their properties in Table 4.5, following these
descriptions.
Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 197Atomic Solids
Atomic solids are made up of individual atoms that are held together
solely by dispersion forces. The number of naturally occurring atomicsolids is quite small. In fact, the noble gases in their solid state are theonly examples. Since the only forces holding atomic solids together aredispersion forces, these solids have very low melting and boiling points.
Molecular Solids
Molecular solids are, as their name implies, made up of molecules. Like
atomic solids, the molecules that make up molecular solids, such asfrozen methane, are held together mainly by dispersion forces.Consequently, they tend to have low melting and boiling points. In polarmolecular solids, however, stronger dipole-dipole forces, and sometimeshydrogen bonding, give these compounds higher melting points and boiling points than non-polar molecular solids. For example, the meltingpoint of non-polar propane, C
3H8, is −190˚C. A molecule of polar formic
acid, HCOOH, which has a similar number of electrons and the samemolar mass as propane, melts at 8.4 ˚C. The large difference in boiling
point is due to the hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole forces in formicacid. You will often see molecular solids classi ﬁed as covalent solids.
However, it is clearer to classify them as molecular solids, because network solids, which you will see below, also contain covalent bonds.
Network Solids
Unlike the intramolecular covalent bonds that hold atoms together in
discrete molecules, it is possible for atoms to bond covalently into continuous two- or three-dimensional arrays, called network solids .
A wide range of properties can be found among network solids.
Carbon-Based Network Solids
Figure 4.19 shows four allotropic forms of carbon. Allotropes are different
crystalline or molecular forms of the same element that differ in physicaland chemical properties.

D

carbon: (A) graphite; (B) diamond;(C) C
60, buckminsterfullerene;
(D) fullerene nanotubeFigure 4.19
198 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesThe graphite shown in Figure 4.19A is a soft, two-dimensional
network solid that is a good conductor of electricity. It has a high melting point, which suggests strong bonds, but its softness indicates thepresence of weak bonds as well. Each carbon forms three strong covalentbonds with three of its nearest neighbours in a trigonal planar pattern.This structure gives stability to the layers. The fourth, non-bonding pair of electrons is delocalized and free to move within the layers. Thisgives graphite the ability to conduct an electric current. There are nointramolecular forces between the layers. Dispersion forces attract onelayer to another, enabling layers to slide by one another. Graphite feelsslippery as a result of this characteristic. In fact, many industrial processes use graphite as a lubricant.
In diamond, each carbon atom forms four strong covalent bonds with
four other carbon atoms. This three-dimensional array makes diamond thehardest naturally occurring substance. The valence electrons are in highlylocalized bonds between carbon atoms. Therefore, diamond does not conduct electricity. The planes of atoms within the diamond re ﬂect light,
which gives diamond its brilliance and sparkle. The regular arrangementof the carbon atoms in a crystalline structure, coupled with the strength ofthe covalent C
/H11002C bonds, gives diamond its extreme hardness, and makes
it inert to corrosive chemicals.
Fullerenes make up a group of spherical allotropes of carbon.
Figure 4.19C shows C60, which is one type of fullerene discovered in
1985. It was given the name buckminsterfullerene because it resemblesthe geodesic-domed structure designed by architect R. Buckminster Fuller.Also known as “buckyballs, ” C
60is just one of several fullerenes that have
been discovered. Others have been shown to have the formula C70, C74,
and C82. Because of their spherical shape, researchers have speculated
that fullerenes might make good lubricants.
Recently, microscopic-level research has developed very small carbon
networks called nanotubes. As you can see in Figure 4.19D, nanotubes are like a fullerene network that has been stretched into a cylinder shape.Nanotubes of C
400and higher may have applications in the manufacture
of high-strength ﬁbres. In the year 2000, researchers built a nanotube with
a diameter of 4×10−8m. Up to that time, this nanotube was the smallest
structure assembled.
Other Network Solids
Many network solids are compounds, not elements.
Examples include silica, SiO 2, and various metal silicates.
If you were asked to draw a Lewis structure representing
SiO 2, you might draw a molecule that looks like CO2.
However, unlike the bonding that occurs in CO2, the silicon
atom in silica does not form a double bond with an oxygenatom. The likely reason is that silicon ’s 3porbital is too
large to overlap effectively with a 2 porbital of the oxygen
atom. Instead, each silicon atom bonds to four oxygenatoms to give a tetrahedral network with shared oxygenatoms, as shown in Figure 4.20. The network is representedby the formula (SiO
2)n, indicating that SiO 2is the simplest
repeating unit. Quartz is a familiar example of a materialcomposed of silica. At temperatures around 600 ˚C
and extremely low pressures,methane will decompose anddeposit a thin ﬁlm of carbon,
in the form of diamond, on asurface. The process, knownas chemical vapour deposition,or CVD, can be used to coat a wide variety of surfaces. Thehardness of this diamond ﬁlm
can be used for applicationsthat require non-scratch surfaces such as cookware,eyeglasses, and razor blades.FACTCHEM

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 199Ionic Crystals
You know that an ionic crystal is an array of ions, arranged at regular
positions in a crystal lattice. However, a closer look at the structure ofionic crystals shows that they have different and distinct arrangements,depending on the ions involved —speci ﬁcally, their charge and the size.
You can compare the effect of size on crystal packing to fruits stacked
in a grocery store. For example, if you were trying to stack two kinds offruit to attain the most ef ﬁcient use of space, kiwi may ﬁt in among grape-
fruit more ef ﬁciently than oranges could ﬁll the same space. Similarly, in a
crystal, pairs of ions of the same or similar size are arranged differentlycompared with ions of different sizes.
A crystal lattice is made up of identical repeating unit cells that give
the crystal its characteristic shape. Figure 4.21 shows a three-dimensionalrepresentation of a simple cubic arrangement of unit cells.
In most ionic crystals, the anion is larger than the cation and,
therefore, the packing of the anions determines the arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice. There are several possible arrangements for ioniccrystals in which the anions are larger than cations, and cations andanions are present in equal molar amounts. For example, Figure 4.22shows two different arrangements found in the structures of sodium chloride, NaCl, and cesium chloride, CsCl.
(A) Face-centred cubic structure of NaCl; (B) Body-centred cubic structure
of CsCl
In the sodium chloride crystal, each chloride ion ( Cl−) is surrounded
by six sodium ions ( Na+). Similarly, each Na+ion is surrounded by six Cl−
ions. In CsCl, each cesium ion ( Cs+) ion is surrounded by eight Cl−ions.
Within a crystal lattice, de ﬁnite lines of cleavage are present along
which a crystal may be split. This is an identifying property of ionic solids.Figure 4.22

200 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesCanadians in Chemistry
Dr. R.J. Le Roy
You usually study science as discrete ﬁelds
of inquiry: chemistry, physics, and biology, forexample. Each of these ﬁelds has numerous
sub-ﬁelds, such as geophysics and biochemistry.
One of the scientists at the forefront of chemicalphysics is Canada ’s Dr. R.J. Leroy.
During a fourth-year undergraduate research
project at the University of Toronto, Dr. R.J. Leroypursued an answer to the following question: If youuse photodissociation to separate iodine moleculesinto atoms, what fraction of the light is absorbed,and how does that fraction depend on the colour(frequency) of the light and on the temperature ofthe molecules? (Photodissociation is a process thatinvolves the use of light to decompose molecules.)
The light causes a bonded molecule in its
ground state to undergo a transition into an excitedstate. In this new state, the atoms repel one another,causing the molecule to break apart. The fraction of light absorbed, as measured spectroscopically,depends on the population of molecules in the initial state.
Chemists can use the fraction of light absorbed
by a sample to monitor the concentration of speci ﬁc
molecules in a closed, controlled environment. To do this, chemists also need to know the value for a key proportionality constant that is unique toeach substance, known as the molar absorption
coefﬁcient . These coef ﬁcients can be measured at
room temperature, but not at high temperatures.
“In principle, we have known the quantum
mechanics to describe these processes, ” Dr. Le Roy
explains, “But to use that information, we have to
understand the forces atoms experience as theatoms come together or fall apart. ”
For his master ’s thesis at the University
of Toronto, Dr. Le Roy developed computer programs to perform the exact quantum mechanical
calculation of the absorption coef ﬁcients governing
photodissociation processes. Later, when doing his doctoral thesis at the University of Wisconsin, he and his thesis supervisor, Dr. Richard Bernstein,developed the Le Roy-Bernstein theory. This theorydescribes the patterns of energies and other properties for vibrational levels of molecules lyingvery close to dissociation.
To determine when to trust the equations of the
Le Roy-Bernstein theory, Dr. Le Roy developed whathe calls “a little rule of thumb, ” more generally
known as the Le Roy radius. A calculation for the Le Roy radius, R
LR, is:
R>RLR=2[<rA2>1/2+<rB2>1/2]
where Ris the internuclear distance between two
atoms A and B.
The Le Roy radius is the minimum distance at
which the equation describing the vibrations of molecules close to dissociation is thought to bevalid. The <r
A2>and <rB2>values are the squares
of the radii of the atoms of the two elements (or of the two atoms of the same element) in theirground states.
Is there a practical outcome to mathematical
chemistry? Dr. Le Roy strongly encourages “curiosity-oriented science, ” as opposed to a
focus on short-term, practical results, partly becausepractical results do come when processes are fully understood.
For example, the study of global warming is
hindered, in his view, because the intermolecularinteractions are not well known. “To properly model
the processes, we have to understand the exchange of energy during molecular collisions. If we knowthem, we can predict an immense amount. ”

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 201Determining the Type of Bonding in Substances
The type of bonding in a substance depends upon the kinds of atoms it
contains and the forces of attraction between those atoms. If you know the physical properties of a substance, you can often predict the type ofbonding in the substance. Table 4.5 summarizes the types of forces ofattraction and the physical properties of solids with different types ofbonding discussed in this section. In Investigation 4-B, you will design an experiment in which you predict the type of bonding in various substances, then test your prediction.

Ionic Liquids: A Solution
to the Problem of Solutions
Although organic solvents are commonplace in
industry, they are highly volatile and dangerousin the large quantities that manufacturingprocesses require. Disposing of used solvents is a major environmental concern.
Until recently, the idea of a recyclable,
non-volatile solvent seemed like the stuff ofscience ﬁction. But in the 1980s, researchers
in the United States were trying to create a newelectrolyte for batteries. Instead, they created acolourless, odorless liquid that was composedof nothing but ions —an ionic liquid .
An ionic liquid is a salt in liquid form.
Ionic liquids do not usually ﬁnd practical
applications, since ionic compounds have such high boiling points. For example, sodiumchloride does not begin to melt until it reachesa temperature of about 800 ˚C.
In an ionic liquid, the cations are much
larger than in typical ionic substances. As aresult, the anions and cations cannot be packedtogether in an orderly way that balances boththe sizes and distances of the ions with thecharges between them. As a result, they remainin a loosely-packed, liquid form. Because thecharges on the cations have the capacity tobind more anions, an ionic liquid has a netpositive charge. Notice the large cation of theionic liquid molecule shown below. This iswhat makes ionic liquids suitable solvents. The net charge can attract molecules of othercompounds, dissolving them.
Many properties of ionic liquids make them
more desirable solvents than organic solvents.For example, ionic liquids require a lot of energy to change their state —they remain
as liquids even at temperatures of 200 ˚C. In addition, ionic liquids evaporate sparingly.
Organic solvents, on the other hand, easilyrelease fumes that are harmful, often toxic, and that can eventually oxidize and create carbon dioxide, a notorious greenhouse gas.
As solvents, ionic liquids can be uniquely
“tuned ” to a particular purpose by adjusting
the anion/cation ratio. To decaffeinate coffee,for example, you could create an ionic liquidthat would just dissolve caffeine and nothingelse. Current research suggests that ionic liquids can be recovered from solution and reused.
Yet, there are still many hurdles that must
be overcome before these substances can be put to widespread use. Because ionic liquidsboil at high temperatures, conventional methods of separating reaction products fromsolution cannot be used. Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, for instance, ofteninvolve the process of distillation. The highertemperatures required to distill using ionic liquids (as opposed to organic liquids) woulddecompose many of the desired pharmaceuticalcompounds.
The discovery of ionic liquids is proving a
fertile ﬁeld for researchers. Ionic solvents are
revealing new mechanisms of reaction andenhancing our understanding of the molecularworld. As well, their potential applications inboth industry and the home have encouragedseveral companies, world-wide, to furtherexplore and develop these unusual substances.

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 203
204 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesAmorphous Solids
Solids that are composed of molecules that are not arranged in an orderly,
crystalline structure are called amorphous. This term comes from theGreek word amorphos , meaning “without form. ” Glass is a typical
example of this type of solid. Heating silica sand to its melting point ofapproximately 1700 ˚C, adding limestone ( CaCO
3) and soda ash ( Na2CO3),
and then allowing the mixture to cool, was the ﬁrst method of making
soda-lime glass, dating back 4000 years ago.
Today, soda-lime glass makes up almost 90% of all glass manufac-
tured and ﬁnds its applications in window glass and bottle production.
It typically contains SiO 2, Na2O, CaO, MgO, and Al2O3. Soda-lime glass
is referred to as an ionic glass, with an approximate composition given bythe formula Na
2O•CaO •(SiO 2)6. Figure 4.23 shows that each silicon atom
is surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedron. These tetrahedra arerandomly arranged among a network of Na
+and Ca2+ions that ﬁll in the
spaces to balance the negative charge on the tetrahedron network.
Glass is an isotropic material, which means that its properties are the
same in all directions. This is a useful property, since it means that glassexpands uniformly as it is heated.
By changing the proportion of the components or adding other
components, different properties can be given to the glass. For example,adding B
2O3so that it makes up 13% by weight of the glass results in
borosilicate glass, sold as Pyrex ™. Its low coef ﬁcient of thermal expansion
indicates that it will expand very little when heated. Pyrex ™is, therefore,
an “ovenproof ” product. Pyrex ™is often also used in laboratory glassware
as it can be heated numerous times over a ﬂame without cracking.
Flint glass contains lead(II) oxide, PbO and is used in lenses because
of its low refractive index, meaning that light passing through does notbend very much.
Some elements also exist in amorphous forms. For example, charcoal
is an impure, amorphous form of carbon. When sulfur is heated to its boiling point and cooled quickly, an amorphous form called plastic sulfur
forms. It has the formula S
∞, and is often called “polymeric sulfur. ”

You may have heard that
glass actually ﬂows very
slowly over time. This is, infact, a misconception, possiblycaused by the fact that someolder windows are thicker atthe base. In the past, windowmanufacturers were not ableto make windows of perfectlyuniform thickness. The windows were probably set on their broader side for stability —their thickness did
not change over time due toslowly ﬂowing glass.FACTCHEMStructure of

Chapter 4  Structures and Properties of Substances • MHR 205Metal alloys can be amorphous, too. Liquidmetal ™ alloy is an
amorphous alloy of zirconium mixed with nickel, titanium, copper, andberyllium. It is used in the heads of some brands of golf clubs. Traditionalmetal club heads may have microscopic gaps where planes of metalliccrystals meet. These tiny gaps are a potential source of weakness. Theamorphous alloy is non-crystalline, so the metal structure does not havepotential breakage sites.
A Material Made to Order: Intermolecular and Intramolecular
Forces in Action
The gloves in the photograph at the start of this chapter are anything but
ordinary. The thin, lightweight fabric can withstand startling impacts andpiercing forces, including small projectiles such as bullets. In fact, thissame fabric is used to make bulletproof vests. The long strands of ﬁbre
used to make such protective gear are interlaced to form a dense “net”
that is capable of absorbing large amounts of energy. You have probablyheard the trade name for this astounding ﬁbre: KEVLAR
®. It was invented
by an American research chemist, Stephanie Kwolek, in 1965.
The secret to stopping a bullet with a fairly soft fabric is that it
behaves in much the same way as the netting on the goal frame used inhockey. When a hockey puck strikes a net at 100 km/h, its kinetic energyis transferred to the lengths of twine of the goal net. This twine is aninterlaced mesh that has strands which stretch horizontally and verticallyto disperse the energy of impact over a wide area.
The sample principle applies to KEVLAR
®. It belongs to a class
of ﬁbres called aramids, which are polymers containing aromatic
and amide groups. The polymer forms in the condensation reactionbetween terephthalic acid and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine, as shown inFigure 4.24A. The strength of the polymer comes from the intramolecularforces in the aromatic group that limit bond rotation in the straight chains,and the amide linkage that leads to intermolecular hydrogen bondingbetween the straight chains, as shown in Figure 4.24B.

206 MHR • Unit 2  Structure and PropertiesIn addition to stopping a bullet from penetrating the armour, a
bulletproof vest must also protect the body from the blunt force of impact.A bulletproof vest cannot have as much “give” as a hockey net (that is, it
should not stretch back as much as hockey nets do upon impact).Otherwise, its wearer would still be injured, even though the bullet mightnot pierce the fabric. To accomplish this, the properties of KEVLAR
®are
enhanced by twisting the strands to increase their density and thickness.The strands are then woven very tightly. A resin coating is applied andsandwiched between two layers of plastic ﬁlm. Each layer acts as a net
and slows down the bullet a little at a time until it has been stopped.
Deriving Theory from Application: Superconductors
When she ﬁrst synthesized KEVLAR ®, Stephanie Kwolek did not know
that it would eventually be used in bulletproof vests or protective gloves.She did, however, understand the theories behind the properties thatmake it suitable for such applications —the theories of intermolecular
and intramolecular forces. This is not always the case. Often scientistsdiscover a material that has useful or interesting properties, but are unableto explain them.
For example, in 1911, Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes
cooled some mercury to the boiling point of liquid helium: 4 K. He found that at this low temperature, the mercury developed an astonishingproperty. The super-cooled mercury had zero resistance when an electriccurrent passed through it. In other words, none of the energy of the electrical current was given off as wasted heat. The mercury had become a superconductor —a material with no resistance to electric current.
Most conducting materials, even good conductors such as copper, give
off wasted heat as electric current passes though them. In other words,they have resistance. By contrast, superconductors are “perfect ” electrical
conductors.
Scientists are interested in superconductors because they have a num-
ber of properties that arise from their lack of resistance. For example, oncea current is induced in a circuit made with a superconducting material,the current continues to ﬂow through the circuit inde ﬁnitely, without ever
diminishing. Also, superconductors have the ability to completely repelmagnetic ﬁeld lines. This means that a magnet placed over a supercon-
ductor hovers in mid-air, as shown in Figure 4.25.
A magnet hovers above a superconductor, cooled by liquid nitrogen. Figure 4.25
Since Onnes ’s discovery, chemists have discovered other metals that
superconduct at extremely low temperatures. A niobum metal alloy wasfound to exhibit superconductivity at 23 K, for example. But scientistswanted to ﬁnd materials that exhibit superconductivity at much higher
temperatures, because refrigerants like liquid helium are very expensive.
In 1986, materials containing copper oxide ions were discovered to
be superconductors at 30 K. This was an astounding discovery, becausethese materials are insulators at room temperature and higher. Researchersbegan experimenting with this new class of superconductors, tweakingtheir composition, and soon developed a material ( Tl
2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10) that
superconducts at 125 K. This is close to the boiling point of nitrogen, acheaper refrigerant than liquid helium.
It would be ideal, of course, to eliminate the need for a refrigerant
altogether. Finding a material that exhibits superconductivity at roomtemperature is one of the driving forces of superconductivity research,and the search continues. As of 2001, the highest known temperature for a superconductor is 138 K. Researchers continue to search for newclasses of materials that superconduct. In fact, in 2001, researchers foundevidence to suggest that carbon nanotubes may superconduct, even attemperatures surpassing the boiling point of water.
Current and Future Applications
The properties of superconducting materials suggest a wealth of
applications. Despite the need to maintain low temperatures, they havealready found uses in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a medical diag-nostic tool. They have also been used to create powerful electromagnets,used in magnetically levitated (MAGLEV) trains.  Superconductors in the future could be used to make 100% ef ﬁcient electrical wires,
allowing power plants to be built far from cities. A room-temperaturesuperconductor could also mean ultra-fast, low-power electronics.
Many of the ideas necessary to help describe and explain
superconductivity involve topics you will encounter in future chemistrycourses. Even armed with these ideas, however, researchers do not yethave a complete, accepted theory to explain this intriguing property.Nevertheless, the list of superconducting materials continues to expand,and engineers continue to ﬁnd practical applications for them.
Section Summary
Describing and explaining the chemical and physical changes in the
world around you requires an understanding of matter at the atomic level.You have seen, for example, that the concepts of intramolecular and intermolecular forces are both needed to articulate the bonding, structure,and properties of substances as familiar as water and as exotic asKEVLAR

UNIT 2 Project
Materials Convention
Background
The qualities and characteristics of a material are
determined by the bonding between the particlesthat make up the material. For example, pure car-bon exists in several different forms, or allotropes.Each allotrope contains different bonding, andtherefore has different properties. The “lead” of a pencil is really made of graphite, a silver-greyallotrope of carbon. Graphite is a good writing toolbecause the layered bonding arrangement creates asoft material that is easily transferred to paper byrubbing. The softness and slipperiness of graphitealso make it a valuable industrial lubricant.Diamond, another allotrope of carbon, is one of thehardest materials on Earth. Diamonds are useful incutting and drilling applications. Because they arebeautiful, sparkling stones, diamonds are also usedin jewellery.
Humans have used the materials in their
environment for thousands of years. In addition to natural materials, new materials are continuallybeing invented. Some inventions take place by accident, and others by design. These new materialsare often more effective, efﬁcient, or cheaper thantraditional materials.
Optical ﬁbres, each made of two different types of glass,
pass through the eye of a steel needle.Whale oil was once a popular choice for lamp fuel.
Later, a new, “cutting-edge” fuel was developed frompetroleum to replace whale oil. What was this newfuel? How did it compare to whale oil?
Copper has long been prized for its beauty,
malleability, and conductivity. However, in recentﬁbre-optic technology, intricate atom-layering production processes are being used to produce amaterial that has thousands of times the conductiveability of copper. What is this new material?

CHALLENGE
In the nineteenth century, railway
tunnels were blasted through theRocky Mountains to connect BritishColumbia with the rest of Canada.Workers used nitroglycerin to blastthrough the rock. This compound isso unstable, however, that accidentswere frequent and many workersdied. Alfred B. Nobel found a wayto stabilize nitroglycerin, and makeit safer to use, when he inventeddynamite.
What makes nitroglycerin such
a dangerous substance? First, nitro-glycerin, C
3H5(NO 3)3(/lscript), gives off a
large amount of energy when itdecomposes. In fact, about 1500 kJof energy is released for every mole of nitroglycerin that reacts. Second,the decomposition of nitroglycerinoccurs very quickly—in a fraction of a second. This fast, exothermic reaction is accompanied by atremendous shock wave, which iscaused by the expansion of thegaseous products. Finally, nitroglycerin is highly shock-sensitive. Simply shaking or jarringit can cause it to react.
Thus, nitroglycerin’s explosive
properties are caused by three fac-tors: the energy that is given off byits decomposition, the rate at whichthe reaction occurs, and the smallamount of energy that is needed toinitiate the reaction. In this unit,you will learn about the energy andrates of various chemical reactions.Energy Changes and

Concepts and SkillsThink about a prehistoric family group building a ﬁre. It may seem as
though this ﬁre does not have much in common with a nuclear powerplant. Both the ﬁre and the nuclear power plant, however, are technolo-gies that harness energy-producing processes.
As you learned in Unit 2, humans continually devise new techno-
logies that use chemical reactions to produce materials with useful properties. Since the invention of ﬁre, humans have also worked to devisetechnologies that harness energy. These technologies depend on the factthat every chemical, physical, and nuclear process is accompanied by acharacteristic energy change. Consider the melting of an ice cube to cool adrink, the combustion of natural gas to cook a meal, and the large-scaleproduction of electricity via a nuclear power plant. All societies dependon the energy changes that are associated with these physical, chemical,and nuclear processes.
In this chapter, you will study the causes and magnitude of the
energy changes that accompany physical changes, chemical reactions, and nuclear reactions. You will see that different processes involve vastlydifferent amounts of energy. You will learn how to calculate the amountof energy that is absorbed or released by many simple physical changesand chemical reactions. This will allow you to predict energy changeswithout having to carry out the reaction—an important skill to have whendealing with dangerous reactions. Finally, you will examine the efﬁciencyand environmental impact of traditional and alternative energy sources.

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 221The Energy of Physical, Chemical,
and Nuclear Processes
Most physical changes, chemical reactions, and nuclear reactions are
accompanied by changes in energy. These energy changes are crucial tolife on Earth. For example, chemical reactions in your body generate theheat that helps to regulate your body temperature. Physical changes, suchas evaporation, help to keep your body cool. On a much larger scale, therewould be no life on Earth without the energy from the nuclear reactionsthat take place in the Sun.
The study of energy and energy transfer is known as thermodynamics .
Chemists are interested in the branch of thermodynamics known as thermochemistry: the study of energy involved in chemical reactions.
In order to discuss energy and its interconversions, thermochemists haveagreed on a number of terms and deﬁnitions. You will learn about theseterms and deﬁnitions over the next few pages. Then you will examine theenergy changes that accompany chemical reactions, physical changes, andnuclear reactions.
Studying Energy Changes
The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of the
universe is constant. In other words, energy can be neither destroyed nor created. This idea can be expressed by the following equation:
∆E
universe =0
Energy can, however, be transferred from one substance to another. It can
also be converted into various forms. In order to interpret energy changes,scientists must clearly deﬁne what part of the universe they are dealingwith. The system is deﬁned as the part of the universe that is being studied
and observed. In a chemical reaction, the system is usually made up of thereactants and products. By contrast, the surroundings are everything else
in the universe. The two equations below show the relationship betweenthe universe, a system, and the system’s surroundings.
Universe =System +Surroundings
∆E
universe =∆Esystem +∆Esurroundings =0
From the relationship, we know that any change in the system is
accompanied by an equal and opposite change in the surroundings.
∆Esystem =− ∆Esurroundings
Look at the chemical reaction that is taking place in the ﬂask in
Figure 5.1. A chemist would probably deﬁne the system as the contents of the ﬂask—the reactants and products. Technically, the rest of the universe is the surroundings. In reality, however, the entire universechanges very little when the system changes. Therefore, the surroundingsare considered to be only the part of the universe that is likely to beaffected by the energy changes of the system. In Figure 5.1, the ﬂask, thelab bench, the air in the room, and the student who is carrying out thereaction all make up the surroundings. The system is more likely to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence its immediate surroundings than, say, a mountaintop in Japan (also, technically, part of the surroundings).
The solution in the
ﬂask is the system. The ﬂask, thelaboratory, and the student are thesurroundings.Figure 5.1
222 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionHeat and Temperature
Heat , Q, refers to the transfer of kinetic energy. Heat is expressed in the
same units as energy—joules (J). Heat is transferred spontaneously from awarmer object to a cooler object. When you close the door of your home ona cold day to “prevent the cold from getting in,” you are actually preventingthe heat from escaping. You are preventing the kinetic energy in your warmhome from transferring to colder objects, including the cold air, outside.
Temperature ,T, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
that make up a substance or system. You can think of temperature as a wayof quantifying how hot or cold a substance is, relative to another substance.
Celsius degrees and Kelvin degrees are the same size. The Kelvin scale begins
at absolute zero. This is the temperature at which the particles in a substance have no kineticenergy. Therefore, Kelvin temperatures are never negative. By contrast, 0˚C is set at the melting point of water. Celsius temperatures can be positive or negative.
Temperature is measured in either Celsius degrees (˚C) or kelvins (K).
The Celsius scale is a relative scale. It was designed so that water’s boiling point is at 100˚C and water’s melting point is at 0˚C. The Kelvinscale, on the other hand, is an absolute scale. It was designed so that 0 Kis the temperature at which a substance possesses no kinetic energy. Therelationship between the Kelvin and Celsius scales is shown in Figure 5.2,and by the following equation.
Temperature in Kelvin degrees =Temperature in Celsius degrees +273.15
Enthalpy and Enthalpy Change
Chemists deﬁne the total internal energy of a substance at a constant
pressure as its enthalpy , H. Chemists do not work with the absolute
enthalpy of the reactants and products in a physical or chemical process.Instead, they study the enthalpy change , ∆H, that accompanies a process.
That is, they study the relative enthalpy of the reactants and products in a
system. This is like saying that the distance between your home and yourschool is 2 km. You do not usually talk about the absolute position of
your home and school in terms of their latitude, longitude, and elevation.You talk about their relative position, in relation to each other.
The enthalpy change of a process is equivalent to its heat change at
constant pressure.Figure 5.2373.15K

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 223Enthalpy Changes in Chemical Reactions
In chemical reactions, enthalpy changes result from chemical bonds being
broken and formed. Chemical bonds are sources of stored energy. Breaking
a bond is a process that requires energy .Creating a bond is a process that
releases energy . For example, consider the combustion reaction that takes
place when nitrogen reacts with oxygen.
N2(g)+O2(g)→2NO (g)
In this reaction, one mole of nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds and one mole
of oxygen-oxygen double bonds are broken. Two moles of nitrogen-oxygenbonds are formed. This reaction absorbs energy. In other words, moreenergy is released to form two nitrogen-oxygen bonds than is used to breakone nitrogen-nitrogen bond and one oxygen-oxygen bond. When a reactionresults in a net absorption of energy, it is called an endothermic reaction .
On the other hand, when a reaction results in a net release of energy,
it is called an exothermic reaction . In an exothermic reaction, more energy
is released to form bonds than is used to break bonds. Therefore, energy isreleased. Figure 5.3 shows the relationship between bond breaking, bondformation, and endothermic and exothermic reactions.
Representing Enthalpy Changes
The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is known as the enthalpy
of reaction , ∆Hrxn. The enthalpy of reaction is dependent on conditions
such as temperature and pressure. Therefore, chemists often talk about thestandard enthalpy of reaction , ∆H˚
rxn: the enthalpy change of a chemical
reaction that occurs at SATP (25 ˚C and 100 kPa). Often, ∆H˚rxnis written
simply as ∆H˚. The ˚ symbol is called “nought. ” It refers to a property of
a substance at a standard state or under standard conditions. You may see the enthalpy of reaction referred to as the heat of reaction in other
chemistry books.
Representing Exothermic Reactions
There are three different ways to represent the enthalpy change of an
exothermic reaction. The simplest way is to use a thermochemical
equation : a balanced chemical equation that indicates the amount of heat
that is absorbed or released by the reaction it represents. For example,consider the exothermic reaction of one mole of hydrogen gas with half a mole of oxygen gas to produce liquid water. For each mole of hydrogengas that reacts, 285.8 kJ of heat is produced. Notice that the heat term isincluded with the products because heat is produced.

Chemists use different sub-
scripts to represent enthalpychanges for speci ﬁc kinds
of reactions. For example,
∆H
comb represents the enthalpy
change of a combustion reaction.FACTCHEM
224 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionYou can also indicate the enthalpy of reaction as a separate expression
beside the chemical equation. For exothermic reactions, ∆H˚ is always
negative.
H2(g)+1
2O2(g)→H2O(/lscript)∆H˚rxn=−285.8 kJ
A third way to represent the enthalpy of reaction is to use an enthalpy
diagram. Examine Figure 5.4 to see how this is done.
Representing Endothermic Reactions
The endothermic decomposition of solid magnesium carbonate produces
solid magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. For each mole of magne-sium carbonate that decomposes, 117.3 kJ of energy is absorbed. As for anexothermic reaction, there are three different ways to represent theenthalpy change of an endothermic reaction.
You can include the enthalpy of reaction as a heat term in the
chemical equation. Because heat is absorbed in an endothermic reaction,the heat term is included on the reactant side of the equation.
117.3 kJ +MgCO
3(s)→MgO (s)+CO2(g)
You can also indicate the enthalpy of reaction as a separate expression
beside the chemical reaction. For endothermic reactions, the enthalpy ofreaction is always positive.
MgCO
3(s)→MgO (s)+CO2(g) ∆H˚rxn=117.3 kJ
Finally, you can use a diagram to show the enthalpy of reaction.
Figure 5.5 shows how the decomposition of solid magnesium carbonatecan be represented graphically.
Stoichiometry and Thermochemical Equations
The thermochemical equation for the decomposition of magnesium carbonate, shown above, indicates that 117.3 kJ of energy is absorbedwhen one mole, or 84.32 g, of magnesium carbonate decomposes. Thedecomposition of two moles of magnesium carbonate absorbs twice asmuch energy, or 234.6 kJ.
MgCO
3(s)→MgO (s)+CO2(g) ∆H˚rxn=117.3 kJ
2MgCO 3(s)→2MgO (s)+2CO 2(g) ∆H˚rxn=234.6 kJ
Enthalpy of reaction is linearly dependent on the quantity of products.
That is, if the amount of products formed doubles, the enthalpy changealso doubles. Figure 5.6 shows the relationship between the stoichiometryof a reaction and its enthalpy change. Because of this relationship, anexothermic reaction that is relatively safe on a small scale may beextremely dangerous on a large scale. One of the jobs of a chemical engineer is to design systems that allow exothermic reactions to be carriedout safely on a large scale. For example, the blast furnaces used in steelmaking must withstand temperatures of up to 2000 ˚C, produced by the
exothermic combustion reaction of coal with oxygen.

What Is Required?
You need to calculate the enthalpy change, ∆H, when the given amount

What Is Given?
You know the enthalpy change for the reaction of two moles of Al with one mole of Cl

Plan Your Strategy
Convert the given mass of Al to moles. The enthalpy change is linearly
dependent on the quantity of reactants. Therefore, you can use a ratio todetermine the enthalpy change for 1.0 kg of Al reacting with Cl

Enthalpy changes are associated with physical changes as well as with
chemical reactions. You have observed examples of these enthalpychanges in your daily life. Suppose that you want to prepare some pasta.You put an uncovered pot of water on a stove element. The heat from theelement causes the water to become steadily hotter, until it reaches 100 ˚C
(the boiling point of water at 100 kPa). At this temperature, heat is stillbeing added to the water. The average kinetic energy of the liquid watermolecules does not increase, however. Instead, the energy is used to breakthe intermolecular bonds between the water molecules as they changefrom liquid to vapour.

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 227100˚C until all the water has been vaporized. If you add heat to the
vapour, the temperature of the vapour will increase steadily.
When you heat ice that is colder than 0 ˚C, a similar process occurs.
The temperature of the ice increases until it is 0 ˚C (the melting point of
water). If you continue to add heat, the ice remains at 0 ˚C but begins to
melt, as the bonds between the water molecules in the solid state begin to break.
Figure 5.7 shows the relationship between temperature and heat for
a solid substance that melts and then vaporizes as heat is added to it.
You can represent the enthalpy change that accompanies a phase
change —from liquid to solid, for example —just like you represented the
enthalpy change of a chemical reaction. You can include a heat term inthe equation, or you can use a separate expression of enthalpy change. For example, when one mole of water melts, it absorbs 6.02 kJ of energy.
H
2O(s)+6.02 kJ →H2O(/lscript)
H2O(s)→H2O(/lscript)∆H=6.02 kJ
Normally, however, chemists represent enthalpy changes associated with
phase changes using modi ﬁed ∆Hsymbols. These symbols are described
below.
•enthalpy of vaporization , ∆Hvap: the enthalpy change for the phase
change from liquid to gas
•enthalpy of condensation , ∆Hcond: the enthalpy change for the phase
change of a substance from gas to liquid
•enthalpy of melting , ∆Hmelt: the enthalpy change for the phase change of
a substance from solid to liquid
•enthalpy of freezing , ∆Hfre: the enthalpy change for the phase change of
a substance from liquid to solid
Vaporization and condensation are opposite processes. Thus, the
enthalpy changes for these processes have the same value but oppositesigns. For example, 6.02 kJ is needed to vaporize one mole of water.Therefore, 6.02 kJ of energy is released when one mole of water freezes.
∆H
vap=− ∆Hcond
Similarly, melting and freezing are opposite processes.
∆Hmelt=− ∆Hfre
Several enthalpies of melting and vaporization are shown in Table 5.1.
Notice that the same units (kJ/mol) are used for the enthalpies of melting,vaporization, condensation, and freezing. Also notice that energy changesassociated with phase changes can vary widely.

Hot Packs and Cold Packs:
Using the Energy of Physical Changes
You just learned about the enthalpy changes that are associated with
phase changes. Another type of physical change that involves a heat transfer is dissolution. When a solute dissolves in a solvent, the enthalpychange that occurs is called the enthalpy of solution , ∆H
soln. Dissolution
can be either endothermic or exothermic.
Manufacturers take advantage of endothermic dissolution to
produce cold packs that athletes can use to treat injuries. One type of coldpack contains water and a salt, such as ammonium nitrate, in separatecompartments. When you crush the pack, the membrane that divides thecompartments breaks, and the salt dissolves. This dissolution process isendothermic. It absorbs heat for a short period of time, so the cold packfeels cold. Figure 5.8 shows how a cold pack works.SubstanceEnthalpy of melting,

inﬂammation of the joint.
Some types of hot packs are constructed in much the same way as the cold
packs described above. They have two compartments. One compartmentcontains a salt, such as calcium chloride. The other compartment containswater. In hot packs, however, the dissolution process is exothermic. Itreleases heat to the surroundings.Figure 5.8
Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 229Energy and Nuclear Reactions
The energy that is released by a physical change, such as the dissolution
of calcium chloride, can warm your hands. The energy that is released bya chemical reaction, such as the formation of water, can power a rocket.The energy that is released by a nuclear reaction, such as the nuclear reactions in the Sun, however, can provide enough heat to fry an egg on a sidewalk that is 150 000 000 km away from the surface of the Sun.
From previous science courses, you will recall that nuclear reactions
involve changes in the nuclei of atoms. Often nuclear reactions result in thetransformation of one or more elements into one or more different elements.
Like physical changes and chemical reactions, nuclear reactions are
accompanied by energy changes. Nuclear reactions, however, produce sig-niﬁcantly more energy than physical and chemical processes. In nuclear
reactions, a signiﬁcant amount of the mass of the reactants is actuallyconverted into energy .
Ever since Albert Einstein devised his famous equation, E=mc
2,
we have known that mass and energy are interconvertible. In Einstein ’s
equation, Eis energy in kg•m2/s2(J), mis the mass in kg, and c2is the
square of the speed of light.
c2=(3.0 ×108m/s)2
=9.0×1016m2/s2
As you can see, c2is an enormous number. Therefore, even a very tiny
amount of matter is equivalent to a signi ﬁcant amount of energy.
For example, compare the mass of 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms with the
mass of the individual nucleons in 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms. The mass of6 mol of hydrogen-1 atoms (one proton and one electron each) and 6 molof neutrons is 12.098 940 g. The mass of 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms isexactly 12 g. Note that the mass of the electrons does not change in anuclear reaction.
12.098 940 g/mol
−12.000 000 g/mol
0.098 940 g/mol
The difference in mass is signi ﬁcant. It would show up on any reasonably
precise balance. Thus, the mass of the nucleus of carbon-12 is signi ﬁcant-
ly less than the mass of its component nucleons. The difference in massbetween a nucleus and its nucleons is known as the mass defect . What
causes this mass defect? It is caused by the nuclear binding energy : the
energy associated with the strong force that holds a nucleus together.
Nucleus +Nuclear binding energy →Nucleons
You can use Einstein ’s equation to calculate the nuclear binding
energy for carbon-12.
∆E=∆mc
2
=(9.89 ×10−5kg/mol)(9.0 ×1016m2/s2)
=8.9×1012J/mol
=8.9×109kJ/mol
Clearly, the energy associated with the bonds that hold a nucleus together
is much greater than the energy associated with chemical bonds, whichare usually only a few hundred kJ/mol.
The higher the binding energy of a nucleus, the more stable the nucleus
is. Nuclei with mass numbers ( A) that are close to 60 are the most stable.
Nuclear reactions, in which nuclei break apart or fuse, tend to form nucleithat are more stable than the reactant nuclei. Figure 5.9 illustrates the relative stability of various nuclei.www.mcgrawhill.ca/links/

nuclei and the product nuclei represents the energy change of the nuclear reaction.
Nuclear Fission
A heavy nucleus can split into lighter nuclei by undergoing nuclear
ﬁssion . Nuclear power plants use controlled nuclear ﬁssion to provide
energy. Uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion is responsible for the massive
destructiveness of an atomic bomb.
The most familiar ﬁssion reactions involve the splitting of uranium
atoms. In these reactions, a uranium-235 atom is bombarded with neutrons. The uranium nucleus then splits apart into various productnuclei. Two examples of ﬁssion reactions that involve uranium-235 are
shown in Figure 5.10.
Uranium can undergo ﬁssion in numerous different ways, producing various
product nuclei. Two examples are shown here.Figure 5.10

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 231Fission reactions produce vast quantities of energy. For example, when
one mole of uranium-235 splits, it releases 2.1×1013J. By contrast, when
one mole of coal burns, it releases about 3.9×106J. Thus, the combustion
of coal releases about ﬁve million times fewer joules of energy per mole
than the ﬁssion of uranium-235.
Nuclear Fusion
Two smaller nuclei can fuse to form a larger nucleus, in what is called a
nuclear fusion reaction. You and all other life on Earth would not exist
without nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions are the source of theenergy produced in the Sun.
One example of a fusion reaction is the fusion of deuterium
and tritium.

1H→4

The seemingly simple reaction between deuterium and tritium produces
1.7×1012J of energy for each mole of deuterium. This is about 10 times
fewer joules of energy than are produced by the ﬁssion of one mole of
uranium. It is still, however, 500 000 times more energy than is producedby burning one mole of coal.
Scientists are searching for a way to harness the energy from fusion
reactions. Fusion is a more desirable way to produce energy than ﬁssion.
The main product of fusion, helium, is relatively harmless compared withthe radioactive products of ﬁssion. Unfortunately,
fusion is proving more dif ﬁcult than ﬁssion to harness.
Fusion will not proceed at a reasonable rate without anenormous initial input of energy. This is not a problemin the core of the Sun, where the temperature rangesfrom 7 500 000 ˚C to 15 000 000 ˚C. It is a problem in
industry. Scientists are working on safe and economicalways to provide the high-temperature conditions thatare needed to make fusion a workable energy source.
Comparing the Energy of Physical, Chemical,
and Nuclear Processes
In this section, you learned that physical changes,
chemical reactions, and nuclear reactions all involveenergy changes. You also learned that the energychanges have some striking differences in magnitude.Figure 5.11 shows energy changes for some physical,chemical, and nuclear processes. Some other interestingenergy statistics are included for reference.The ﬁssion of one mole of
uranium-235 produces moreenergy than the fusion of onemole of deuterium with onemole of tritium. What if youcompare the energy that isproduced in terms of mass of
reactants? Calculate a ratio to compare the energy that is produced from fusion andﬁssion, per gram of fuel. What

Specific Expectations  Determining Enthalpy
of Reaction by Experiment
Chemical and physical processes, such as the ones you studied in
section 5.1, are associated with characteristic enthalpy changes. How dochemists measure these enthalpy changes?
To measure the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process, chemists
insulate the system from the surroundings. They can then determine the heat change by measuring the temperature change of the system. Whatis the relationship between the heat change and the temperature change?As you learned in previous science courses, each substance has a charac-teristic property that dictates how its temperature will change when heatis lost or gained.
Speci ﬁc Heat Capacity
The amount of energy that is needed to raise the temperature of one
gram of a substance 1 ˚C (or 1 K) is the speciﬁc heat capacity , c, of the
substance. Speci ﬁc heat capacity is usually expressed in units of J/g•˚C.
The speci ﬁc heat capacities of several substances are given in Table 5.2.
Figure 5.12 shows that you can often predict the relative speci ﬁc heat
capacities of familiar substances.
Table 5.2 Speci ﬁc Heat Capacities of Selected Substances
You can use the speci ﬁc heat capacity of a substance to calculate the
amount of energy that is needed to heat a given mass a certain number of degrees. You can also use the speci ﬁc heat capacity to determine the
amount of heat that is released when the temperature of a given massdecreases. The speci ﬁc heat capacity of liquid water, as shown in
Table 5.2, is 4.184 J/g
•˚C. This relatively large value indicates that a
considerable amount of energy is needed to raise or lower the temperatureof water.Substance Specific heat capacity (J/g •  ˚C at 25 ˚C)

On a sunny day, you
would probably prefer to sit on abench made of wood rather than a bench made of aluminum. Woodhas a higher heat capacity thanaluminum. Therefore, more heat isneeded to increase its temperature.Figure 5.12
Explain why water is some-
times used as a coolant forautomobile engines.
Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 235All samples of the same substance have the same speci ﬁc heat
capacity. In contrast, heat capacity , C, relates the heat of a sample, object,
or system to its change in temperature. Heat capacity is usually expressedin units of kJ/ ˚C.
Consider a bathtub full of water and a teacup full of water at room
temperature. All the water has the same speci ﬁc heat capacity, but the
two samples have different heat capacities. It would take a great deal moreheat to raise the temperature of the water in the bathtub by 10 ˚C than it
would take to raise the temperature of the water in the teacup by 10 ˚C.
Therefore, the water in the bathtub has a higher heat capacity.
Speci ﬁc Heat Capacity and Heat Transfer
You can use the following equation to calculate the heat change of a sub-
stance, based on the mass of the substance. You can also use this equationto calculate the speci ﬁc heat capacity of the substance and the change in
its temperature.

Water is often used in controlled surroundings to measure the heat of a
reaction. For example, you can use the equation above to determine theamount of energy that is needed to heat 1.00 ×10
2g of water from 20.0 ˚C
to 45.0 ˚C.
Q=m•c•∆T
The mass of the water is 1.00 ×102g. The speci ﬁc heat capacity of water
is 4.184 J/g •˚C. The temperature of the water increases by 25.0 ˚C.
∴Q=(1.00 ×102g)(4.184 J/g •˚C)(25.0 ˚C)
=1.05 ×104J
To raise the temperature of 1.00 ×102g of water by 25 ˚C, 1.05 ×104J of
heat is needed.
Try the following problems to practise working with speci ﬁc heat
capacity and temperature change.

34.8 g. The sample liberates 783 J of heat. The initial temperature of the sample is 22.1 ˚C. What is the ﬁnal temperature?

is 2.46 J/g •˚C.

Measuring Heat Transfer in a Laboratory
From previous science courses, you will probably remember that a
calorimeter is used to measure enthalpy changes for chemical and
physical reactions. A calorimeter works by insulating a system from itssurroundings. By measuring the temperature change of the system, youcan determine the amount of heat that is released or absorbed by the reaction. For example, the heat that is released by an exothermic reaction raises the temperature of the system.
Q
reaction =−Qinsulated system
In your previous chemistry course, you learned about various types
of calorimeters. For instance, you learned about a bomb calorimeter ,
which allows chemists to determine energy changes under conditions of constant volume.
In section 5.1, however, you learned that an enthalpy change repre-
sents the heat change between products and reactants at a constant
pressure . Therefore, the calorimeter you use to determine an enthalpy
change should allow the reaction to be carried out at a constant pressure.In other words, it should be open to the atmosphere.
To determine enthalpy changes in high school laboratories, a
coffee-cup calorimeter provides fairly accurate results. A coffee-cup
calorimeter is composed of two nested polystyrene cups ( “coffee cups ”).
They can be placed in a 250 mL beaker for added stability. Since a coffee-cup calorimeter is open to the atmosphere, it is also called a constant-pressure calorimeter .
As with any calorimeter, each part of the coffee-cup calori-meter has
an associated heat capacity. Because these heat capacities are very small,however, and because a coffee-cup calorimeter is not as accurate as othercalorimeters, the heat capacity of a coffee-cup calorimeter is usuallyassumed to be negligible. It is assumed to have a value of 0 J/ ˚C.
Using a Calorimeter to Determine the Enthalpy of a Reaction
A coffee-cup calorimeter is well-suited to determining the enthalpy
changes of reactions in dilute aqueous solutions. The water in thecalorimeter absorbs (or provides) the energy that is released (or absorbed)by a chemical reaction. When carrying out an experiment in a dilute solution, the solution itself absorbs or releases the energy. You can calculate the amount of energy that is absorbed or released by the solution using the equation mentioned earlier.
Q=m
•c•∆T
The mass, m, is the mass of the solution , because the solution absorbs the
heat. When a dilute aqueous solution is used in a calorimeter, you canassume that the solution has the same density and speci ﬁc heat capacity
as pure water. As you saw above, you can also assume that the heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. In other words, you can assumethat all the heat that is released or absorbed by the reaction is absorbed or released by the solution.
The following Sample Problem illustrates how calorimetry can be
used to determine ∆Hof a chemical reaction.

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 239In Practice Problems 9, 11, and 12, you used experimental data to deter-
mine the enthalpy of reaction for neutralization reactions. Neutralizationreactions are particularly well suited to analysis involving the use of acoffee-cup calorimeter for a number of reasons:
•When using dilute solutions of acids and bases, you can assume
their density is close to the density of water. Therefore, you can easilymeasure the volume of the solutions and calculate their mass.
•Neutralization reactions between dilute strong acids and dilute strong
bases tend to cause temperature changes in the reaction mixture that arelarge enough to be measurable using a standard thermometer, but smallenough for safety.
•Neutralization reactions take place very quickly. Therefore, the peak
temperature change also occurs very quickly. There is little time for heat transfer between the insulated system and the surroundings to take place.
In the following investigation, you will construct a coffee-cup calorimeter
and use it to determine the enthalpy of a neutralization reaction.10.A chemist wants to determine empirically the enthalpy change for

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 243Hess’s Law of Heat Summation
In section 5.2, you used a coffee-cup calorimeter to determine the quantity
of heat that was released or absorbed in a chemical reaction. Coffee-cupcalorimeters are generally used only for dilute aqueous solutions. Thereare many non-aqueous chemical reactions, however. There are also manyreactions that release so much energy they are not safe to perform using a coffee-cup calorimeter. Imagine trying to determine the enthalpy of reaction for the detonation of nitroglycerin, an unstable and powerfullyexplosive compound. Furthermore, there are reactions that occur tooslowly for the calorimetric method to be practical. (You will learn moreabout rates of reactions in the next chapter.)
Chemists can determine the enthalpy change of any reaction using an
important law, known as Hess’s law of heat summation . This law states
that the enthalpy change of a physical or chemical process depends only
on the beginning conditions (reactants) and the end conditions (products).The enthalpy change is independent of the pathway of the process andthe number of intermediate steps in the process . It is the sum of the
enthalpy changes of all the individual steps that make up the process.
For example, carbon and oxygen can form carbon dioxide via two
pathways.
1.Carbon can react with oxygen to form carbon monoxide. The carbonmonoxide then reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. The twoequations below represent this pathway.

2O2(g)→CO(g) ∆H˚=−110.5 kJ

2.Carbon can also react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide directly.
C(s)+O2(g)→CO2(g) ∆H˚=−393.5 kJ
In both cases, the net result is that one mole of carbon reacts with one
mole of oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide. (In the ﬁrst
pathway, all the carbon monoxide that is produced reacts with oxygen toform carbon dioxide.) Notice that the sum of the enthalpy changes for theﬁrst pathway is the same as the enthalpy change for the second pathway.
Examine Figure 5.13 to see how to represent the two pathways using
one enthalpy diagram.

244 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionOne way to think about Hess ’s law is to compare the energy changes
that occur in a chemical reaction with the changes in the potential energyof a cyclist on hilly terrain. This comparison is shown in Figure 5.14.
Hess ’s law allows you to determine the energy of a chemical reaction
without directly measuring it. In this section, you will examine two waysin which you can use Hess ’s law to calculate the enthalpy change of a
chemical reaction:
1.by combining chemical equations algebraically
2.by using the enthalpy of a special class of reactions called formation reactions
Combining Chemical Equations Algebraically
According to Hess ’s law, the pathway that is taken in a chemical reaction
has no effect on the enthalpy change of the reaction. How can you useHess ’s law to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction? One way is to
add equations for reactions with known enthalpy changes, so that theirnet result is the reaction you are interested in.
For example, you can combine thermochemical equations (1) and (2)
below to ﬁnd the enthalpy change for the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide, equation (3).
(1) H2O2(/lscript)→H2(g)+O2(g) ∆H˚=+188 kJ
(2)H2(g)+1
2O2(g)→H2O(/lscript) ∆H˚=−286 kJ
(3) H2O2(/lscript)→H2O(/lscript)+1
2O2(g) ∆H˚=?
Carefully examine equation (3), the target equation. Notice that
H2O2is on the left (reactant) side, while H2Oand 1
2O2are on the right
(product) side. Now examine equations (1) and (2). Notice which sides ofthe equations H
2O2and H2Oare on. They are on the correct sides, based
on equation (3). Also notice that hydrogen does not appear in equation (3).Therefore, it must cancel out when equations (1) and (2) are added. Sincethere is one mole of H
2(g)on the product side of equation (1) and one mole
of H2(g)on the reactant side of equation (2), these two terms cancel. Set up
equations (1) and (2) as shown on the next page. Add the products andthe reactants. Then cancel any substances that appear on opposite sides.∆ heightstarting point

tions with known enthalpy changes. They added to the target equation asthey were written. In many cases, however, you will need to manipulatethe equations before adding them. There are two key ways in which youcan manipulate an equation:
1.Reverse an equation so that the products become reactants and the
reactants become products. When you reverse an equation, you need to change the sign of ∆H˚(multiply by −1).
2.Multiply each coef ﬁcient in an equation by the same integer or
fraction. When you multiply an equation, you need to multiply ∆H˚
by the same number.
Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to manipulate
equations so that they add to the target equation. Try the problems thatfollow to practise ﬁnding the enthalpy change by adding equations. enthalpy, HH2(g) + O2(g)

equations and their enthalpy changes.

Fe2O3(s)+3CO (g)→3CO 2(g)+2Fe (s)
What Is Given?
You know the chemical equations for reactions (1) and (2), and their
corresponding enthalpy changes.
Plan Your Strategy
Step 1 Examine equations (1) and (2) to see how they compare with
the target equation. Decide how you need to manipulate equations (1) and (2) so that they add to the target equation.(Reverse the equation, multiply the equation, do both, or do neither). Remember to adjust ∆H˚ accordingly for each equation.
Step 2 Write the manipulated equations so that their equation arrows
line up. Add the reactants and products on each side, and cancelsubstances that appear on both sides.
Step 3 Ensure that you have obtained the target equation. Add ∆H˚ for
the combined equations.
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 Equation (1) has CO as a reactant and CO2as a product, as does
the target reaction. The stoichiometric coef ﬁcients do not match
the coef ﬁcients in the target equation, however. To achieve the
same coef ﬁcients, you must multiply equation (1) by 3.
Equation (2) has the required stoichiometric coef ﬁcients, but Fe
and Fe2O3are on the wrong sides of the equation. You need to
reverse equation (2) and change the sign of ∆H˚.
Step 2 Multiply each equation as required, and add them.
3 ×(1) 3CO (g)+3
2O2(g)→3CO 2(g) ∆H˚=3(−283.0 kJ)
−1 ×(2) Fe2O3(s)→2Fe (s)+3

2O2(g)
or
Fe2O3(s)+3CO (g)→3CO 2(g)+2Fe (s)
Step 3 The desired equation is achieved. Therefore, you can calculate
the enthalpy change of the target reaction by adding the heats of reaction for the manipulated equations.
∆H˚=3(−283.0 kJ) +824.2 kJ =−24.8 kJ
∴Fe
2O3(s)+3CO (g)→3CO 2(g)+2Fe (s) ∆H˚=−24.8 kJ

Because the equations added correctly to the target equation, you know
you manipulated the equations with known enthalpy changes correctly.Check to ensure that you adjusted ∆H˚ accordingly for each equation.Continued ...

250 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionUsing Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation
You have learned how to add equations with known enthalpy changes
to obtain the enthalpy change for another equation. This method can betime-consuming and dif ﬁcult, however, because you need to ﬁnd reactions
with known enthalpy changes that will add to give your target equation.There is another way to use Hess ’s law to ﬁnd the enthalpy of an equation.
Formation Reactions
In Investigation 5-B, you used the reaction of oxygen with hydrogen to
form water. Reactions like this one are known as formation reactions . In a
formation reaction, a substance is formed from elements in their standardstates. The enthalpy change of a formation reaction is called the standard
molar enthalpy of formation , ∆H˚
f. The standard molar enthalpy of forma-
tion is the quantity of energy that is absorbed or released when one mole ofa compound is formed directly from its elements in their standard states .
Some standard molar enthalpies of formation are listed in Table 5.3.
Notice that the standard enthalpies of formation of most compounds are negative. Thus, most compounds are more stable than the elements theyare made from.
Table 5.3 Selected Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation
By de ﬁnition, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard
state is zero . The standard state of an element is usually its most
stable form under standard conditions. Recall, from section 5.1, that standard conditions are 25 ˚C and 100 kPa (close to room temperature
and pressure). Therefore, the standard state of nitrogen is N
2(g). The
standard state of magnesium is Mg(s).
Some elements exist in more than one form under standard condi-
tions. For example, carbon can exist as either graphite or diamond, asshown in Figure 5.16. Graphite is de ﬁned as the standard state of carbon.
Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation of graphite carbon is 0kJ/mol. The standard enthalpy of formation of diamond is 1.9 kJ/mol.Another example is oxygen, O
2(g). Oxygen also exists in the form of ozone,Compound ∆H˚f Formation equations

252 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionCalculating Enthalpy Changes
You can calculate the enthalpy change of a chemical reaction by adding
the heats of formation of the products and subtracting the heats of forma-tion of the reactants. The following equation can be used to determine theenthalpy change of a chemical reaction.
∆H˚=Σ(n∆H˚
fproducts) −Σ(n∆H˚freactants)
In this equation, nrepresents the molar coef ﬁcient of each compound in
the balanced chemical equation and Σmeans “the sum of. ”
As usual, you need to begin with a balanced chemical equation. If a
given reactant or product has a molar coef ﬁcient that is not 1, you need to
multiply its ∆H˚fby the same molar coef ﬁcient. This makes sense because
the units of ∆H˚fare kJ/mol. Consider, for example, the complete
combustion of methane, CH4(g).
CH4(g)+2O2(g)→CO2(g)+2H2O(g)
Using the equation for the enthalpy change, and the standard enthalpies
of formation in Appendix E, you can calculate the enthalpy change of thisreaction.
Substitute the standard enthalpies of formation from Appendix E to get
the following calculation.
∆H˚=[(−393.5 kJ/mol) +2(−241.8 kJ/mol)] −[(−74.8 kJ/mol) +2(0 kJ/mol)]
=−802.3 kJ/mol of CH

How does this method of adding heats of formation relate to Hess ’s law?
Consider the equations for the formation of each compound that isinvolved in the reaction of methane with oxygen.
(1)H2(g)+1
2O2(g)→H2O(g) ∆H˚f=−241.8 kJ
(2) C(s)+O2(g)→CO2(g) ∆H˚f=−393.5 kJ
(3) C(s)+2H2(g)→CH4(g) ∆H˚f=−74.6 kJ
There is no equation for the formation of oxygen, because oxygen is an
element in its standard state.
By adding the formation equations, you can obtain the target equation.
Notice that you need to reverse equation (3) and multiply equation (1) by 2.
2×(1) 2H2(g)+O2(g)→2H2O(g) ∆H˚f=2(−241.8) kJ

Add the manipulated ∆H˚fvalues: ∆H˚=2(−241.8) kJ −393.5 kJ +74.6 kJ
=−802.3 kJ.
This value of ∆H˚is the same as the value you obtained using ∆H˚f
data. When you used the addition method, you performed the same
operations on the enthalpies of formation before adding them. Therefore,using enthalpies of formation to determine the enthalpy of a reaction isconsistent with Hess ’s law. Figure 5.17 shows the general process for
determining the enthalpy of a reaction from enthalpies of formation.∆H˚=[(∆H˚fof CO 2(g))+2(∆H˚fof H 2O(g))]−[1(∆H˚fof CH 4(g))+2(∆H˚fof O 2(g))]
“Using enthalpies of formation
is like a shortcut for addingequations to obtain ∆H˚.” Do
you agree with this statement?Explain your answer.
Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 253The overall enthalpy change of any reaction is the sum of the enthalpy change
of the decomposition of the reactants to their elements and the enthalpy change of the forma-tion of the products from their elements.
It is important to realize that, in most reactions, the reactants do not
actually break down into their elements and then react to form products.Since there is extensive data about enthalpies of formation, however, it is useful to calculate the overall enthalpy change this way. Moreover,according to Hess ’s law, the enthalpy change is the same, regardless of
the pathway. (In Chapter 6, you will learn more about the mechanisms by which compounds and elements react to form different elements andcompounds.)

to power vehicles, light and heat buildings, and manufacture productsthat support our lives and lifestyles. As society ’s needs for energy and
energy-using products grow, scientists and technologists search for moreeconomical and environmentally responsible ways to meet these needs. In this section, you will compare energy sources based on their ef ﬁciency
and environmental impact.
Energy and Ef ﬁciency
When you think about energy ef ﬁciency, what comes to mind? You may
think about taking the stairs instead of the elevator, choosing to drive asmall car instead of a sport utility vehicle, or turning off lights when youare not using them. What, however, does ef ﬁciency really mean? How do
you quantify it?
There are several ways to de ﬁne ef ﬁciency. One general de ﬁnition
says that energy ef ﬁciency is the ability to produce a desired effect with
minimum energy expenditure. For example, suppose that you want tobake a potato. You can use a microwave oven or a conventional oven.Both options achieve the same effect (baking the potato), but the ﬁrst
option uses less energy. According to the general de ﬁnition above, using
the microwave oven is more energy-ef ﬁcient than using the conventional
oven. The general de ﬁnition is useful, but it is not quantitative.
Another de ﬁnition of ef ﬁciency suggests that it is the ratio of useful
energy produced to energy used in its production, expressed as a percent .
This de ﬁnition quantitatively compares input and output of energy. When
you use it, however, you need to be clear about what you mean by “energy
used. ” Figure 5.19 shows factors to consider when calculating ef ﬁciency
or analyzing ef ﬁciency data.0

Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 257It is often dif ﬁcult to determine how much energy is used to produce
useful energy. Often an ef ﬁciency percent only takes into account the
“ideal ” energy output of a system, based on the energy content of the fuel.
Efﬁciency and Natural Gas
When discussing the ef ﬁciency of a fuel such as natural gas, you need to
specify how that fuel is being used. Consider, for example, natural gas.Natural gas is primarily methane. Therefore, you can estimate an idealvalue for energy production using the enthalpy of combustion of methane.
CH
4(g)+2O2(g)→CO2(g)+2H2O(g) ∆H˚=−802 kJ
In other words, 16 g of methane produces 802 kJ of heat (under constant
pressure conditions).
When natural gas is used directly in cooking devices, its ef ﬁciency can
be as high as 90%. Thus, for every 16 g of gas burned, you get about 720 kJ(0.90 ×802 kJ) of usable energy as heat for cooking. This is a much higher
fuel ef ﬁciency than you can get with appliances that use electrical energy
produced in a power plant that runs on a fuel such as coal.
If natural gas is used to produce electricity in a power plant, however,
the ef ﬁciency is much lower —around 37%. Why? The heat from the
burning natural gas is used to boil water. The kinetic energy of the result-ing steam is transformed to mechanical energy for turning a turbine. The turbine generates the electrical energy. Each of these steps has anassociated ef ﬁciency that is less than 100%. Thus, at each step, the overall
efﬁciency of the fuel decreases.
Thinking About the Environment
Efﬁciency is not the only criterion for selecting an energy source. Since
the 1970s, society has become increasingly conscious of the impact ofenergy technologies on the environment.
Suppose that you want to analyze the environmental impact of an
energy source. You can ask the following questions:
•Are any waste products or by-products of the energy production
process harmful to the environment? For example, any process in whicha hydrocarbon is burned produces carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is aknown greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming. Any com-bustion process provides the heat required to form oxides of nitrogenfrom nitrogen gas. Nitrogen oxides contribute to acid precipitation.
•Is obtaining or harnessing the fuel harmful to the environment? For
example, oil wells and strip coal mines destroy habitat. Natural gaspipelines, shown in Figure 5.20, are visually unappealing. They alsosplit up habitat, which harms the ecosystem.Efficiency  =  ×  100%  Useful energy produced
Energy used
”Energy used “ could include
ideal energy content of fuelenergy used to extract and transport fuelsolar energy used to create fuel (e.g. biomass)energy used to build and maintain power plant”Useful energy “ is
energy delivered to consumer in usable formactual work done
Efﬁciency is
expressed as a percent. Alwaysspecify what is included in the“energy used ” part of the ratio.Figure 5.19
This gas pipeline
harms the ecosystem by splitting up habitat.Figure 5.20
•Will using the energy source permanently remove the fuel from the
environment? A non-renewable energy source (such as coal, oil, or
natural gas) is effectively gone once we have used it up. Non-renewableenergy sources take millions of years to form. We use them up at amuch faster rate than they can be replenished. An energy source that is clearly renewable is solar energy. The Sun will continue to radiate
energy toward Earth over its lifetime —many millions of years. A some-
what renewable energy source is wood. Trees can be grown to replacethose cut down. It takes trees a long time to grow, however, and habitatis often destroyed in the meantime.
Comparing Energy Sources
Both ef ﬁciency and environmental impact are important factors to con-
sider when comparing energy sources. In the following ThoughtLab, youwill research and compare alternative and conventional energy sources.
258 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionIn this ThoughtLab, you will work as a class to
compare two different energy sources.
Procedure
1.On your own, or with a group, choose an energy
source from the following list. Other energysources may be discussed and added in class.solar (radiant) energy woodpetroleum biomasshydrogen fuel cell nuclear ﬁssion

2.Before beginning your research, record your cur-
rent ideas about the ef ﬁciency and environmental
impact of your chosen energy source.
3.Research the ef ﬁciency and environmental
impact of your energy source. If possible, determine what the ef ﬁciency data means.
For example, suppose that a source tells you that natural gas is 90% ef ﬁcient. Is the source
referring to natural gas burned directly for heator for cooking? Is the energy being convertedfrom heat to electricity in a power plant? Be asspeci ﬁc as possible.
4.Ensure that you use a variety of sources to ﬁnd
your data. Be aware of any bias that might bepresent in your sources.
5.Trace the energy source as far back as you can.

Nuclear Safety Supervisor
Jennifer Noronha
In some ways, nuclear power is an appealing power
source. Nuclear reactions create large amounts ofenergy from minimal material, and they generatenone of the carbon dioxide and other emissions thatcause acid rain and global warming. The productsand reactants of nuclear reactions, however, aredangerously radioactive. Therefore, special meas-ures are needed to protect nuclear power stationemployees from daily exposure to radiation. That is where Jennifer Noronha comes in. Noronha is the supervisor of Radiological Services atDarlington. Employee safety —especially from high
radiation doses —is her ﬁrst priority.
The Darlington Nuclear Generating Station
is located 70 km east of Toronto. It uses a fuel ofnatural uranium to produce enough electricity toprovide power for a city the size of Toronto.Noronha and her radiation protection team plan andimplement safety programs that minimize doserates, or the amount of radiation that stationemployees are exposed to.
Station employees must undergo four weeks
of radiation protection training. This training wasdesigned by Noronha ’s department, based on an
extensive investigation of radiation ﬁelds within
the station, as well as a thorough evaluation of past safety programs and approaches. Through thistraining, employees learn how to measure existingdose rates with survey equipment, assess whatkinds of tools and protective clothing are needed,
and take appropriate action to lower radiation doses.For example:
•Airborne hazards, such as tritium (present in radiated water vapour), can be reduced by runningthe station ’s dryer system. The dryer system
catches the radiated vapour and dries it out of the air.
•Non-airborne radiation can be countered byshielding the affected area with lead blankets orsheeting material.
Noronha ’s strong mathematics skills were evident
from an early age. When she moved to Canada fromKenya at age 11, she was immediately put ahead agrade. Her mathematics skills and her father ’s engi-
neering profession were what propelled her towardengineering. Noronha earned her engineeringphysics degree from McMaster University. Hercourses included general chemistry, biomedical theory, and nuclear theory. She worked as a commissioning engineer at Darlington during itsstart-up. She tested the station ’s safety shut-down
systems and helped to bring the station ’s ﬁrst
reactor on-line. “It was pretty amazing, ” Noronha
says. “At the time, it was still relatively new
technology, and it was Canadian technology. ”
Noronha got her MBA from the University of
Toronto in 1998. Soon after, she moved to her current position, which allows her to combine herpeople skills and technical expertise.

Hot Ice
When engineers ﬁrst began extending natural
gas pipelines through regions of bitter cold,they noticed that their lines plugged with adangerous slush of ice and gas. The intensepressure of the lines, combined with the cold,led to the formation of methane hydrates ,
a kind of gas-permeated ice. More than a mere nuisance, methane hydrate plugs were apotential threat to pipelines. The build-up ofgas pressure behind a methane hydrate plugcould lead to an explosion. Now, however, this same substance may hold the key to a vastfuel supply.
Methane hydrates form when methane
molecules become trapped within an ice latticeas water freezes. They can form in very coldconditions or under high-pressure conditions.Both of these conditions are met in deepoceans and in permafrost. In Canada, hydrateshave already been found in large quantities inthe Canadian Arctic. Methane hydrate has anumber of remarkable properties. For example,when brought into an oxygen atmosphere, themethane fumes can be ignited, making itappear that the ice is burning!
Methane releases 25% less carbon dioxide per
gram than coal, and it emits none of the oxidesof nitrogen and sulfur that contribute to acidprecipitation. Therefore, using methane inplace of other fossil fuels is very desirable.Methane hydrates seem to be an ideal andplentiful “pre-packaged ” source of natural gas.
Estimates of the exact amount of methanestored in hydrates suggest there could beenough to serve our energy needs anywhere
from 350 years to 3500 years, based on currentlevels of energy consumption. This would con-stitute a signi ﬁcant source of fossil fuels, if we
can ﬁnd a way to extract the gas safely and
economically.
Unfortunately, hydrates become unstable
when the pressure or temperature changes.Even small changes in these conditions cancause hydrates to degrade rapidly. Methanehydrates are stable at ocean depths greater than300 m, but offshore drilling at these depths hasbeen known to disturb the hydrate formations,causing large, uncontrolled releases of ﬂamma-
ble methane gas. Also, methane hydrates oftenhold sediment layers together. Therefore, inaddition to the danger of a gas explosion, thereis the danger of the sea ﬂoor collapsing where
drilling occurs.
Methane is a signi ﬁcant greenhouse gas.
A massive release of methane could cause catastrophic global climate change. Someresearchers believe that the drastic climatechange that occurred during the Pleistocene era was due to methane hydrate destabilizationand widespread methane release.
Nonetheless, Canada, Japan, the United
States, and Russia all have active research andexploration programs in this area. As global oil supplies dwindle, using methane hydratesmight increasingly be seen as worth the riskand cost.
Making Connections
1.Compare using methane from natural gaswith using methane from methane hydratesin terms of environmental impact and ef ﬁ-
ciency. You will need to do some researchto ﬁnd out extraction methods for each
source of methane.
2.On the Internet, research one possible struc-ture of methane hydrate. Create a physicalmodel or a three-dimensional computermodel to represent it. Use your model toexplain why methane hydrates are unstableat temperatures that are warmer than 0
˚C.
Chapter 5  Energy and Change • MHR 261Emerging Energy Sources
In the ThoughtLab on page 258, you probably noticed that all energy
sources have drawbacks as well as bene ﬁts. Scientists and engineers are
striving to ﬁnd and develop new and better energy sources. One energy
source that engineers are trying to harness is nuclear fusion. As youlearned in section 5.1, nuclear fusion provides a great deal of energy fromreadily available fuel (isotopes of hydrogen). In addition, nuclear fusionproduces a more benign waste product than nuclear ﬁssion (helium).
Unfortunately, fusion is not yet practical and controllable on a large scalebecause of the enormous temperatures involved.
Chemists are also striving to ﬁnd new sources for existing fuels that
work well. The Chemistry Bulletin on the facing page discusses a new potential source of methane.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned about ef ﬁciency. You learned how it can
be de ﬁned in different ways for different purposes. You used your
understanding of processes that produce energy to investigate the efﬁciency and environmental impact of different energy sources.
In Chapter 5, you learned about the energy that is associated with
chemical reactions. You used a calorimeter to measure heat changes, andyou used these heat changes to write thermochemical equations. Youprobably already realize that adding heat to reactants often speeds up areaction. In other words, raising the temperature of a system consisting ofa chemical reaction often increases the speed of the reaction. A familiarexample is cooking. You increase the temperature of a heating element to speed up the reactions that are taking place in the food as it cooks.How does increasing temperature speed up a reaction? Is the enthalpy of a reaction related to its speed? Chapter 6 addresses these questions.
Your friend tells you about an energy source that is supposed to be
46% ef ﬁcient. What questions do you need to ask your friend in order
to clarify this claim?
Efﬁciency and environmental concerns are not always separate. In
fact, they are often closely linked. Give three examples of energysources in which changes in ef ﬁciency affect environmental impact, or
vice versa.
Design an experiment to determine the ef ﬁciency of a laboratory
burner. You will ﬁrst need to decide how to de ﬁne the ef ﬁciency, and
you will also need to ﬁnd out what fuel your burner uses. Include a
complete procedure and safety precautions.
Some high-ef ﬁciency gas furnaces can heat with an ef ﬁciency of
up to 97%. These gas furnaces work by allowing the water vapour pro-duced during combustion to condense. Condensation is an exothermicreaction that releases further energy for heating. Use the information inthis section to demonstrate the increased heat output, using Hess ’s law.
The enthalpy of condensation of water is 44 kJ/mol.

Hydrogen is a very appealing fuel, in part because burning it

Racing cars, such as the one shown below, can reach speeds that are well
above 200 km/h. In contrast, the maximum speed of many farm tractors isonly about 25 km/h. Just as some vehicles travel more quickly than others,some chemical reactions occur more quickly than others. For example,compare the two reactions that occur in vehicles: the decomposition ofsodium azide in an air bag and the rusting of iron in steel.
When an automobile collision activates an air bag, sodium azide,
NaN
3(g), decomposes to form sodium, Na(s), and nitrogen gas, N2(g). (The
gas inﬂates the bag.) This chemical reaction occurs almost instantan-eously. It inﬂates the air bag quickly enough to cushion a driver’s impactin a collision.
On the other hand, the reaction of iron with oxygen to form rust pro-
ceeds quite slowly. Most Canadians know that the combination of road saltand wet snow somewhat increases the rate of the reaction. Even so, it takesseveral years for a signiﬁcant amount of rust to form on the body of a car.This is a good thing for car owners—if rusting occurred as fast as the reaction in an inﬂating air bag, cars would ﬂake to pieces in seconds.
Why do some reactions occur slowly while others seem to take place
instantaneously? How do chemists measure, compare, and express the ratesat which chemical reactions occur? Can chemists predict and control therate of a chemical reaction? These questions will be answered in Chapter 6.

Reaction Rates
As you learned in the Unit 3 opener, nitroglycerin is an explosive
that was used to clear the way for railroads across North America. Itdecomposes instantly. The reactions that cause fruit to ripen, then rot,take place over a period of days. The reactions that lead to human ageingtake place over a lifetime.
How quickly a chemical reaction occurs is a crucial factor in how
the reaction affects its surroundings. Therefore, knowing the rate of achemical reaction is integral to understanding the reaction.
Expressing Reaction Rates
The change in the amount of reactants or products over time is called thereaction rate . How do chemists express reaction rates? Consider how the
rates of other processes are expressed. For example, the Olympic sprinterin Figure 6.1 can run 100 m in about 10 s, resulting in an average runningrate of 100 m/10 s or about 10 m/s.
The running rate of a sprinter is calculated by dividing the distance
travelled by the interval of time the sprinter takes to travel this distance.In other words, running rate (speed) is expressed as a change in distancedivided by a change in time. In general, a change in a quantity withrespect to time can be expressed as follows.
Rate =Change in quantity
Change in time
=Quantity ﬁnal−Quantity initial
tﬁnal−tinitial
=∆Quantity
∆t
Chemists express reaction rates in several ways. For example, a reaction
rate can be expressed as a change in the amount of reactant consumed orproduct made per unit of time, as shown below. (The letter A represents a compound.)
Rate of reaction =Amount of A
ﬁnal−Amount of A initial (in mol)
tﬁnal−tinitial (in s)
=∆Amount of A
∆t(in mol/s)
When a reaction occurs between gaseous species or in solution, chemists
usually express the reaction rate as a change in the concentration of thereactant or product per unit time. Recall, from your previous chemistrycourse, that the concentration of a compound (in mol/L) is symbolized byplacing square brackets, [ ], around the chemical formula. The equationbelow is the equation you will work with most often in this section.
Rate of reaction =Concentration of A ﬁnal−Concentration of A initial (in mol/L)
tﬁnal−tinitial (in s)
=∆[A]
∆t(in mol/(L •s))
The running rate
(speed) of a sprinter is expressedas a change in distance over time.Figure 6.1
268 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionReaction rates are always positive , by convention . A rate that is expressed
as the change in concentration of a product is the rate at which the concentration of the product is increasing. The rate that is expressed in terms of the change in concentration of a reactant is the rate at whichthe concentration of the reactant is decreasing.
Average and Instantaneous Rates of Reactions
If reactions always proceeded at a constant rate, it would be straight-forward to ﬁnd reaction rates. You would just need the initial and ﬁnalconcentrations and the time interval. Reaction rates, however, are not usually constant. They change with time. How does this affect the waythat chemists determine reaction rates?
Consider the following reaction.
A
(g)→C(g)+D(g)
Now examine the graph in Figure 6.2. The blue line on the graph shows
the concentration of product C as the reaction progresses, based on thedata in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1 Concentration of C During a Reaction at Constant Temperature
The average rate of a reaction is the average change in the concentration
of a reactant or product per unit time over a given time interval. Forexample, using the data in Table 6.1, you can determine the average rateof the reaction from t=0.0s to t=5.0s.
Average rate =∆[C]
∆t
=(3.12 ×10−3mol/L) −0.00 mol/L
5.0 s −0.0 s
=6.2×10−4mol/(L •s)
You can see this calculation in Figure 6.2. On a concentration-time graph,
the average rate of a reaction is represented by the slope of a line that isdrawn between two points on the curve. This line is called a secant .
The average rate of a reaction gives an overall idea of how quickly the
reaction is progressing. It does not, however, tell you how fast the reactionis progressing at a speciﬁc time. For example, suppose that someoneasked you how fast the reaction in Figure 6.2 was progressing over 20.0 s.You would probably calculate the average rate from t=0.0s to t=20.0 s.
You would come up with the answer 3.12 ×10
−3mol/(L •s). (Try this
calculation yourself.) What would you do, however, if you were askedhow fast the reaction was progressing at exactly t=10.0 s?
The instantaneous rate of a reaction is the rate of the reaction at a
particular time. To ﬁnd the instantaneous rate of a reaction using a concentration-time graph, draw a tangent line to the curve and ﬁnd theslope of the tangent. A tangent line is like a secant line, but it touches the
curve at only one point. It does not intersect the curve. 0.00

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 269The slope of the tangent is the instantaneous rate of the reaction.
Figure 6.2 shows the tangent line at t=10.0 s. As shown on the graph,
the slope of the tangent (therefore the instantaneous rate) at t=10.0 s
is 2.3×10−4mol/(L •s).
Notice that near the beginning of the reaction, when the concentration
of the reactants is relatively high, the slope of the tangent is greater (steeper). This indicates a faster reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds,the reactants are used up and the slope of the tangent decreases.
The slope of a tangent drawn to a concentration-time curve represents the
instantaneous rate of the reaction. The slope of a secant is used to determine the averagerate of a reaction.
In the following ThoughtLab, you will use experimental data to draw a
graph that shows the change in concentration of the product of a reaction.Then you will use the graph to help you determine the instantaneous rateand average rate of the reaction.Figure 6.21.00

270 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionReaction Rates in Terms of Products and Reactants
In the ThoughtLab, you analyzed the rate of the following reaction in
terms of the production of oxygen.
2N2O5(g)→4NO 2(g)+O2(g)
There are two other ways to represent the rate of this reaction:
•in terms of the rate of the disappearance of dinitrogen pentoxide
•in terms of the production of nitrogen dioxide
For every 1 mol of O2that is produced, 4 mol of NO 2are also produced.
This means that the rate of production of NO 2is four times greater than
the rate of production of O2. Therefore, the rate of production of O2is one
quarter the rate of production of NO 2. You can express the relationship
between O2production and NO 2production as follows.
∆[O2]
∆t=1
4∆[NO 2]
∆t
When 1 mol of O2is produced, 2 mol of N2O5are consumed. Therefore,
the rate of production of O2is half the rate of disappearance of N2O5. You
can represent this relationship as follows:

∆t=−1

3.Propose a reason for the difference in the
instantaneous rates at 1200 s and 4800 s.

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 271Notice that the expression involving N2O5(the reactant) has a negative
sign. A change in concentration is calculated using the expression below.
Change in concentration =Concentration ﬁnal−Concentration initial
Since the concentration of a reactant always decreases as a reaction
progresses, the change in concentration is always negative. By convention,however, a rate is always expressed as a positive number . Therefore,
expressions that involve reactants must be multiplied by −1 to become
positive.

Problem
Dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5, decomposes to form nitrogen dioxide and
oxygen.
2N2O5(g)→4NO 2(g)+O2(g)
NO 2is produced at a rate of 5.0×10−6mol/(L •s). What is the
corresponding rate of disappearance of N2O5and rate of formation of O2?
What Is Required?
Since N2O5is a reactant, you need to calculate its rate of disappearance.
O2is a product, so you need to ﬁnd its rate of formation.
What Is Given?
You know the rate of formation of NO 2and the balanced chemical
equation.
Plan Your Strategy
First check that the chemical equation is balanced. Then use the molarcoefﬁcients in the balanced equation to determine the relative rates of
disappearance and formation.
Since 4 mol of NO
2are produced for every 2 mol of N2O5that
decompose, the rate of disappearance of N2O5is 2
4, or 1
2, the rate of
formation of NO 2. Similarly, 1 mol of O2is formed for every 4 mol
of NO 2. Therefore, the rate of production of O2is 1

Act on Your Strategy

If the concentration
of H3O+or OH−ions changes over
the course of a reaction, a chemistcan use a pH meter to monitor thereaction.Figure 6.3Methods for Measuring Reaction Rates
How do chemists collect the data they need to determine a reaction rate?
To determine empirically the rate of a chemical reaction, chemists mustmonitor the concentration or amount of at least one reactant or product.There are a variety of techniques available. The choice of techniquedepends on the reaction under study and the equipment available.
Monitoring Mass, pH, and Conductivity
Consider the reaction of magnesium with hydrochloric acid.
Mg
(s)+2HCl (aq)→MgCl 2(aq) +H2(g)
Hydrogen gas is released in the reaction. You can track the decrease in
mass, due to the escaping hydrogen, by carrying out the reaction in anopen vessel on an electric balance. The decrease in mass can be plottedagainst time. Some electronic balances can be connected to a computer,with the appropriate software, to record mass and time data automaticallyas the reaction proceeds.
Another technique for monitoring the reaction above involves pH.
Since HCl is consumed in the reaction, you can record changes in pHwith respect to time. Figure 6.3 shows a probe being used to monitor thechanging pH of a solution.
Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 273A third technique involves electrical conductivity. Dissolved ions in
aqueous solution conduct electricity. The electrical conductivity of thesolution is proportional to the concentration of ions. Therefore, reactionsthat occur in aqueous solution, and involve a change in the quantity ofdissolved ions, undergo a change in electrical conductivity. In the reactionabove, hydrochloric acid is a mix of equal molar amounts of two ions:hydronium, H
3O+, and chloride, Cl−. The MgCl 2that is produced exists as
three separate ions in solution: one Mg2+ion and two Cl−ions. Since there
is an increase in the concentration of ions as the reaction proceeds, theconductivity of the solution also increases with time.
Monitoring Pressure
When a reaction involves gases, the pressure of the system often changes
as the reaction progresses. Chemists can monitor this pressure change. Forexample, consider the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide, shown inthe following chemical reaction.
2N
2O5(g)→4NO 2(g)+O2(g)
When 2 mol of N2O5gas decompose, they form 5 mol of gaseous products.
Therefore, the pressure of the system increases as the reaction proceeds,provided that the reaction is carried out in a closed container. Chemistsuse a pressure sensor to monitor pressure changes.
Monitoring Colour
Colour change can also be used to monitor the progress of a reaction.
The absorption of light by a chemical compound is directly related to theconcentration of the compound. For example, suppose you add severaldrops of blue food colouring to a litre of water. If you add a few millilitresof bleach to the solution, the intensity of the colour of the food dye diminishes as it reacts. You can then monitor the colour change. (Do nottry this experiment without your teacher ’s supervision.)
For accurate measurements of the colour intensity of a solution,
chemists use a device called a spectrophotometer . (See Figure 6.4.)
Monitoring Volume
When a reaction generates gas, chemists can monitor the volume of gas
produced. In Investigation 6-A, you will determine average reaction ratesby recording the time taken to produce a ﬁxed volume of gas. You will
perform several trials of the same reaction to investigate the effects thattemperature, concentration of reactants, and surface area of reactants have on the reaction rate. You will also perform one trial using a different reactant.
If you have access to
probeware, do ProbewareInvestigation 6-A, or a similarinvestigation from a probewarecompany.PROBEWARE

276 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionFactors That Affect Reaction Rate
Chemists have made the following observations about factors that affect
reaction rate.  You may already be familiar with some of these observa-tions, from your previous studies of chemical reactions and fromInvestigation 6-A.
Chemists and engineers use these and other factors to manipulate the
rate of a particular reaction to suit their needs. For example, consider thesynthesis of ammonia, NH
3, from nitrogen and hydrogen.
N2(g)+3H2(g)→2NH 3(g)
This reaction must be carried out with high concentrations of reactants, at
a temperature of 400 ˚C to 500 ˚C, in the presence of a catalyst. Otherwise,
the rate of production of ammonia is too slow to be economically feasible.
Section Summary

You also learned how to determine the averagerate and instantaneous rate of a reaction, given appropriate data. Then you examined different techniques for monitoring the rate of a reaction.Finally, you carried out an investigation to review some of the factors thataffect reaction rate. In the next section, you will learn how to use a ratelaw equation to show the quantitative relationships between reaction rateand concentration.
In your own words, explain why the rate of a chemical reaction
is fastest at the beginning of the reaction.
Show why the expression for the rate of disappearance of a
reactant is always negative, even though rates are always positive, by convention.
Under what circumstances is the rate at which the concentration
of a reactant decreases numerically equal to the rate at which the concentration of a product increases?

Specific Expectations  The Rate Law: Reactant
Concentration and Rate
The rate of a chemical reaction depends on several factors, as you learned
in section 6.1. One of the factors that affect reaction rate is the concentra-tions of the reactants. You know that the rates of most chemical reactionsincrease when the concentrations of the reactants increase. Is there a morespeci ﬁc relationship? In this section, you will explore the quantitative
relationships between the rate of a reaction and the concentrations of thereactants.
Relating Reactant Concentrations and Rate
Consider the general reaction below.
aA+bB→products
This reaction occurs at a constant temperature. The reactant formulas are
represented by A and B. The stoichiometric coef ﬁcients are represented by
aand b. In this section, you will study reaction rates that are not affected
by the concentrations of the products. Therefore, you do not need to usesymbols for the products.
In general, the rate of a reaction increases when the concentrations of
the reactants increase. The dependence of the rate of a reaction on theconcentrations of the reactants is given by the following relationship.
Rate ∝ [A]
m[B]n
This relationship can be expressed in a general equation called the
rate law equation . The rate law equation is shown in Figure 6.5. For any
reaction, the rate law equation expresses the relationship between theconcentrations of the reactants and the rate of the reaction. The letter k
represents a proportionality constant called the rate constant . There is
a different rate constant for each reaction at any given temperature.
The exponents mand nmust be determined by experiment. They
do not necessarily correspond to the stoichiometric coef ﬁcients of their
reactants. They are usually 1 or 2, but values of 0, 3, and even fractionscan occur.
This diagram explains the components of the rate law. Figure 6.5Concentrations of reactantsRate law exponents

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 279The values of the exponents in the rate law equation establish the
order of the reaction. If a given reactant is found to have an exponent of 1,the reaction is said to be ﬁrst order in this reactant. Similarly, if the
exponent of a reactant is 2, the reaction is second order in this reactant.
The sum of the exponents (m+n)is known as the overall reaction order .
For example, the rate law equation below represents a reaction that is ﬁrst
order in A, second order in B, and third order (1+2)overall.
Rate =k[A]
1[B]2
Chemists carry out experiments to determine the rate law equation for a
given reaction at a given temperature. Later in the section, you will workwith data and do this yourself. First, however, it is necessary to examinefurther the rate constant and reaction order.
The Rate Constant
The magnitude of the rate constant, k, indicates the speed of a reaction.
A small rate constant indicates a slow reaction. A large rate constant indicates a fast reaction. For example, a ﬁrst-order reaction with a rate
constant of 10
2s−1will be essentially complete in less than 0.10 s. By
contrast, a ﬁrst-order reaction with a rate constant of 10−3s−1will take
about 2 h.
As a reaction proceeds, the reaction rate decreases because the
concentrations of the reactants decrease. The value of the rate constant,however, remains the same throughout the reaction. In other words, for agiven reaction under constant conditions, the value of kremains constant.
What happens if the temperature changes? Since the rate of a
chemical reaction depends on temperature, so does k. Because a chemical
reaction depends on temperature, chemists who study reaction rates must work at constant temperature. Furthermore, the value of kmust
be accompanied by the temperature at which the reaction occurred. For example, for the second order decomposition of hydrogen iodide,
k=2.7×10
−3L/(mol •s)at 440 ˚C. When the temperature is increased
to 500 ˚C, k=3.9×10−3L/(mol •s).
Deﬁning First-Order Reactions
A ﬁrst-order reaction has an overall order of 1. The decomposition of
dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5, is an example of a ﬁrst-order reaction.
2N2O5(g)→4NO 2(g)+5O2(g)
Experiments have shown that this reaction is ﬁrst order in N2O5. In other
words, the rate law equation is written as follows:
Rate =k[N2O5]1
Because the overall order of the reaction is one, it is a ﬁrst-order reaction.
Reactions with more than one reactant can also be ﬁrst-order
reactions. For example, consider the following reaction.
(CH 3)3CBr (aq)+H2O(/lscript)→(CH 3)3OH (aq)+H+(aq)+Br−(aq)
Experiments have shown that the reaction is ﬁrst order in (CH 3)3CBr, and
zero order in water. In other words, the rate of the reaction does notdepend, at all, on the concentration of water. The rate law equation iswritten as follows:
Rate =k[(CH
3)3CBr (/lscript)]1[H2O(/lscript)]0
The overall reaction order is 1 ( 1+0). The reaction is ﬁrst order.Chemists can trace the
progress of the chemical reaction shown on the left by monitoring its conductivity.Explain why.
280 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionYou frequently encounter ﬁrst-order relationships in everyday
life. For example, if one soft drink costs $1.50, two soft drinks cost $3.00, three cost $4.50, and so on. This ﬁrst-order relationship can be
represented by the following equation.
Cost =$1.50 (Number of soft drinks)
1
Deﬁning Second-Order Reactions
A second-order reaction has an overall reaction order of 2. An example
of a second-order reaction is the decomposition of hydrogen iodide.
2HI (g)→H2(g)+I2(g)
Chemists have determined, by experiment, that this reaction is second
order in hydrogen iodide. Therefore, the rate law equation is written as follows:
Rate =k[HI]
2
Another example of a second-order reaction is the reaction between nitric
oxide and ozone.
NO (g)+O3(g)→NO 2(g)+O2(g)
By experiment, chemists have determined that the reaction is ﬁrst order in
nitric oxide and ﬁrst order in ozone, as shown below:
Rate =k[NO]1[O3]1
The overall order of the reaction is 2 ( 1+1). Therefore, the reaction is a
second order reaction.
For a non-chemistry example of a second-order relationship, consider
the equation for the simple parabola, y=x2. When x=3, y=9.
When x=12, the value of yincreases to 122=144. In other words,
when the value of xincreases by 4, the value of yincreases by a factor
of 42(16×9=144).
Other Reactions
There are also other types of reactions, besides ﬁrst-order and second-
order reactions. For example, consider the decomposition of ammonia ona tungsten, W, catalyst.
2NH
3(g) N2(g)+3H2(g)
The rate law equation for this reaction has been found experimentally.
Rate =k[NH 3]0=k
The rate of decomposition of ammonia on a tungsten catalyst is
independent of the concentration of ammonia, since [NH 3]0=1.
In other words, the rate of the reaction is a constant.
Many reactions have overall orders that are higher than 2. Some
reactions have overall orders that are fractions. In this text, however, you will concentrate on ﬁrst-order and second-order reactions.
The Initial Rates Method
As you have learned, the values of the exponents in a rate law equation
must be determined experimentally. Chemists determine the values of mand nby carrying out a series of experiments. Each experiment has a
different, known set of initial concentrations. All other factors, such astemperature, remain constant. Chemists measure and compare the initialrate of each reaction. Thus, this method is called the initial rates method . W(s)For the decomposition reaction
of hydrogen iodide, the valueof the exponent of [HI] in therate law equation is the sameas its molar coef ﬁcient in the
balanced chemical equation.This is not always the case.The values of the exponents in a rate law equation must
be determined by experiment .FACTCHEM

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 281There are several reasons for using initial rates. One reason is that
chemists do not need to follow each reaction to its end. This saves time,especially when studying slow reactions.
Rate Experiments
To see how the initial rates method works, consider the following reaction:
2N
2O5(g)→2NO 2(g)+O2(g)
The general rate law equation for this reaction is given below.
Rate =k[N2O5]m
To determine the value of m, a chemist performs three experiments. A
different initial concentration of dinitrogen pentoxide, [N2O5]0, is used for
each experiment. The subscript 0 represents t=0. Table 6.2 shows the
results of these experiments.
Table 6.2 Data for Rate Experiments
The value of mcan be determined using at least two different methods. By
inspection, you can see that when the concentration of N2O5is doubled
(experiments 1 and 2), the rate also doubles. When the concentration of
N2O5is tripled (experiments 1 and 3), the rate also triples. This indicates
a ﬁrst-order relationship, as follows:
Rate =k[N2O5]1
Alternatively, you can compare the rate law equation for each experiment
using ratios. This method is useful when the relationship between concentration and rate is not immediately obvious from the data.
Write the rate expressions for experiments 1 and 2 as follows:
Rate
1=k(0.010)m
=4.8×10−6mol/(L •s)
Rate 2=k(0.020)m
=9.6×10−6mol/(L •s)
Create a ratio to compare the two rates.

Rate 2=k(0.010 mol/L)m
k(0.020 mol/L)m=4.8×10−6mol/(L •s)
9.6×10−6mol/(L •s)
Since kis a constant for reactions that occur at a constant temperature,
you can cancel out k.

282 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionDetermining the Rate Constant
Once you know the rate law equation for a reaction, you can calculate the
rate constant using the results from any of the experiments. The rate lawequation for the previous rate experiments is written as follows:
Rate =k[N
2O5]1
You can use data from any of the three experiments to calculate k.
Substituting data from experiment 1, you can solve for k.
4.8×10−6mol/(L •s)=k(0.010 mol/L)
k=4.8×10−6mol/(L •s)
0.010 mol/L
=4.8×10−6s−1
Therefore, for the temperature at which the experiments were carried out,
4.8×10−4s−1is the rate constant. Using data from experiment 2 would
give the same value of k. Notice that the units of the
rate constant are determinedby your calculation. For a ﬁrst-order reaction, the units
are always s
−1. Show why this
is the case. What are the unitsfor a second-order reaction?

Finding a Rate Law Equation
Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 283Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 Begin with experiments 1 and 2, where [ ClO 2] is constant, to
determine the order of the reaction with respect to OH−.
Set up a ratio for the two rates as shown. Notice that you can
cancel out [ ClO 2] because you chose experiments in which [ ClO 2]
did not change.
Rate 2
Rate 1=k(0.0150 mol/L)m(0.0150 mol/L)n
k(0.0500 mol/L)m(0.0250 mol/L)n=2.60 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
1.30 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
Because kis a constant, you can cancel it out.
k(0.0500 mol/L)n
k(0.0250 mol/L)n=2.60 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
1.30 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
(2)n=2
n=1 (by inspection)
Therefore, the reaction is ﬁrst order with respect to OH−.
Set up a ratio for experiments 1 and 3, in which [ OH−] is
constant and [ ClO 2] changes. You can cancel out the [ OH−]
terms right away.
Rate 2
Rate 1=k(0.0450 mol/L)m(0.0250 mol/L)n
k(0.0150 mol/L)m(0.0250 mol/L)n=1.16 ×10−2mol/(L •s)
1.30 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
Since kis a constant, you can cancel it out.
k[0.0450 mol/L]m
k[0.0150 mol/L]m=1.16 ×10−2mol/(L •s)
1.30 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
(3)m=8.92 ≈9
m=2 (by inspection)
The reaction is second order with respect to ClO 2.
Therefore, the rate law equation is written as follows:
Rate =k[ClO 2]2[OH−]
The reaction is second order in ClO 2, ﬁrst order in OH−, and third
order overall.
Step 2 To ﬁnd the value of the rate constant, substitute data from any of
the three experiments into the rate law equation. Using the datafrom experiment 1 gives the following equation.
1.30 ×10
−3mol/(L •s)=k(0.0150 mol/L)2(0.0250 mol/L)
Solve for k.
k=1.30 ×10−3mol/(L •s)
(0.0150 mol/L)2(0.0250 mol/L)
=231 L2/(mol2•s)
Therefore, the rate constant at the temperature of the
experiment is 231 L2/(mol2•s). The rate law equation is
Rate =231 L2/(mol2•s)[CIO 2]2[OH−].
Check Your Solution
To check your values of mand n, solve by inspection. When [ ClO 2] is
constant and [ OH−] doubles, the rate also doubles and the reaction is ﬁrst
order in OH−. When [ OH−] is constant and [ ClO 2] triples, the rate
increases by a factor of 9. Recall that 32=9, indicating a second-order
relationship. To check your value of k, substitute data from experiment
2 or 3. You should get the same answer. Also check the units and thenumber of signi ﬁcant digits for k.When you set up your ratio to
compare rates, it does notmatter which rate is thenumerator, and which is thedenominator. It is often easierto see the solution, however, if the larger rate is the numerator.PROBLEM TIP

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 285The Half-Life of a Reaction
You have seen that a large rate constant indicates a fast reaction, while
a small rate constant indicates a slow reaction. It is not always easy, however, to determine how long a reaction will take to be completed just by looking at the value of k. How can you relate the speed of a
reaction to the units of s
−1for a ﬁrst-order reaction?
The half-life , t1/2, of a reaction is the time that is needed for the
reactant mass or concentration to decrease by one half of its initial value. The SI units for half-life are seconds. Usually, however, half-life is expressed in whatever units of time are appropriate to the reaction. For example, the half-life of a very fast reaction may be measured inmicroseconds. The half-life of a slow reaction may be measured in days.Knowing the half-life of a reaction is an easy way to tell how fast or howslow a reaction is.
Examine Figure 6.6 to see how half-life and reactant concentration are
related for the ﬁrst-order decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide.
This graph shows [ N2O5] versus time for the ﬁrst three half-lives of the
decomposition reaction of N2O5at 44 ˚C . The spheres in the cubes represent [ N2O5].
The half-life of any ﬁrst-order reaction is always a constant, and it
depends on k. In other words, any ﬁrst-order reaction (that is, any reaction
with a rate law equation in the form Rate =k[A]) has a half-life that is
independent of the initial concentration of the reactant, A. The half-life of any ﬁrst-order reaction can be calculated using the following equation.
t
1/2=0.693
k
In this equation, kis the ﬁrst-order rate constant. It has units of s−1.
Examine the Sample Problem on the next page to learn how to calcu-
late the half-life of a ﬁrst-order reaction. Then try the Practice Problems
that follow.Figure 6.60.00000.01000.02000.03000.04000.05000.0600

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 289Theories of Reaction Rates
In section 6.2, you explored the rate law, which de ﬁnes the relationship
between the concentrations of reactants and reaction rate. Why, however,does the rate of a reaction increase with increased concentrations of reactants? Why do increased temperature and surface area increase reaction rates? To try to explain these and other macroscopic observations,chemists develop theories that describe what happens as reactions proceedon the molecular scale. In this section, you will explore these theories.
Collision Theory
Why do factors such as temperature and concentration increase ordecrease the rate of a reaction? To answer this question, chemists mustﬁrst answer another question: What causes a reaction to occur? One
obvious answer is that a reaction occurs when two reactant particles collide with one another. This answer is the basis for collision theory : In
order for a reaction to occur, reacting particles (atoms, molecules, or ions)must collide with one another.
The Effect of Concentration on Reactant Rates
You can use simple collision theory to begin to understand why factorssuch as concentration affect reaction rate. If a collision is necessary for areaction to occur, then it makes sense that the rate of the reaction willincrease if there are more collisions per unit time. More reactant particlesin a given volume (that is, greater concentration) will increase the numberof collisions between the particles per second. Figure 6.7 illustrates this idea.
At increased reactant concentrations, there is an increased number of
collisions per second.
Collision Theory and Surface Area
You can also use simple collision theory to explain why increasing the
surface area of a solid-phase reactant speeds up a reaction. With greatersurface area, more collisions can occur. This explains why camp ﬁres are
started with paper and small twigs, rather than logs. Figure 6.8 shows anexample of the effect of surface area on collision rate.Figure 6.7
Mixtures of grain or
coal dust and air are potentiallyexplosive, as shown in this grainelevator explosion.Figure 6.8Go to the Chemistry 12

290 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionBeyond Collision Theory
Simple collision theory recognizes that a collision between reactants
is necessary for a reaction to proceed. Does every collision result in areaction? Consider a 1 mL sample of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In the sample, about 10
28collisions per second take
place between gas molecules. If each collision resulted in a reaction, all
gas phase reactions would be complete in about a nanosecond ( 10−9s)—a
truly explosive rate! As you know from section 6.2, however, gas phasereactions can occur quite slowly. This suggests that not every collision
between reactants results in a reaction .
In order for a collision between reactants to result in a reaction, the
collision must be effective . An effective collision —one that results in the
formation of products —must satisfy the following two criteria. You will
investigate these criteria over the next few pages.
Orientation of Reactants
Reacting particles must collide with the proper orientation relative to
one another. This is also known as having the correct collision geometry .
The importance of proper collision geometry can be illustrated by the following reaction.
NO
(g)+NO 3(g)→NO 2(g)+NO 2(g)
Figure 6.9 shows ﬁve of the many possible ways in which NO and NO 3
can collide. Only one of these ﬁve possibilities has the correct collision
geometry for a reaction to occur. As shown in the ﬁgure, only a certain
orientation of reactants prior to collision leads to the formation of twomolecules of nitrogen dioxide.
Activation Energy
In addition to collision geometry, there is a second factor that determines
whether a collision will result in a reaction: the energy of the collision.The reactants must collide with energy that is suf ﬁcient to begin to break
the bonds in the reactants and to begin to form the bonds in the products.In most reactions, only a small fraction of collisions have suf ﬁcient
energy for a reaction to occur. The activation energy , Ea, of a reaction is
the minimum collision energy that is required for a successful reaction.
The collision energy depends on the kinetic energy of the colliding
particles. As you know, temperature is a measure of the average kineticenergy of the particles in a substance. If you plot the number of collisionsin a substance at a given temperature against the kinetic energy of each collision, you get a curve like the one in Figure 6.10. The type of distribution that is shown by this curve is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution . The dotted line indicates the activation energy. The shaded
part of the graph indicates the collisions with energy that is equal to orgreater than the activation energy.
How does the distribution of kinetic energy change as the temperature
of a substance increases? Figure 6.11 shows the distribution of kineticFor a collision to be effective, it must satisfy both of these criteria:
1.correct orientation of reactants
2.sufﬁcient collision energy
ineffective

Only one of these ﬁve
possible orientations of NO and
NO 3will lead to the formation of a

The area under a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distributiongraph represents the distribution ofthe kinetic energy of collisions at aconstant temperature. At a giventemperature, only a certain fractionof the molecules in a sample haveenough kinetic energy to react.Figure 6.10
Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 291energy in a sample of reacting gases at two different temperatures,
T1and T2, where T2>T1. The activation energy is indicated by the
dashed vertical line. Two observations are apparent from the graph:
1.At both temperatures, a relatively small fraction of collisions have sufﬁcient kinetic energy —the activation energy —to result in a reaction.
2.As the temperature of a sample increases, the fraction of collisions
with suf ﬁcient energy to cause a reaction increases signi ﬁcantly.
For many reactions, the rate roughly doubles for every 10 ˚C rise in
temperature.
Transition State Theory
Transition state theory is used to explain what happens when molecules
collide in a reaction. It examines the transition, or change, from reactantsto products. The kinetic energy of the reactants is transferred to potentialenergy as the reactants collide, due to the law of conservation of energy.This is analogous to a bouncing basketball. The kinetic energy of the ballis converted to potential energy, which is stored in the deformed ball as ithits the ﬂoor. The potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the
ball bounces away.
You can represent the increase in potential energy during a chemical
reaction using a potential energy diagram : a diagram that charts the
potential energy of a reaction against the progress of the reaction.Examples of potential energy diagrams are shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.13on the next page. The y-axis represents potential energy. The x-axis,
labelled “Reaction progress, ” represents the progress of the reaction
through time.
The “hill” in each diagram illustrates the activation energy barrier
of the reaction. A slow reaction has a high activation energy barrier. Thisindicates that relatively few reactants have suf ﬁcient kinetic energy for
a successful reaction. A fast reaction, by contrast, has a low activationenergy barrier.
A potential energy diagram for an exothermic reaction is shown in
Figure 6.12. The reactants at the beginning of the reaction are at a higherenergy level than the products. The overall difference in potential energyis the enthalpy change, ∆H. There is no way to predict the activation
energy of a reaction from its enthalpy change . A highly exothermic reac-
tion may be very slow because it has a high activation energy. Conversely,a reaction that is very fast may release very little heat. The enthalpychange of a reaction is determined by ﬁnding the overall energy that is T1

A potential energy diagram for an endothermic reaction is shown in
Figure 6.13. The reactants at the beginning of the reaction are at a lowerenergy level than the products. The overall difference in potential energybetween reactants and products is the enthalpy change.
A potential energy diagram A potential energy
for an exothermic reaction diagram for an endothermic reaction
You may already know that many reactions can proceed in two directions.
For example, hydrogen and oxygen react to form water. Water, however,can also undergo electrolysis, forming hydrogen and oxygen. This is thereverse of the ﬁrst reaction.
H

2O2(g)→H2O(/lscript)∆H˚=−285.8 kJ
H2O(/lscript)→H2(g)+1
2O2(/lscript)∆H˚=285.8 kJ
The enthalpy change of the ﬁrst reaction is the same as the enthalpy
change of the second reaction, with the opposite sign. (You can show this using Hess ’s law.) How are the activation energies of forward and
reverse reactions related? For an exothermic reaction, the activation energy of the reverse reaction, E
a(rev) equals Ea(fwd) +∆H. For an endo-
thermic reaction, Ea(rev) equals Ea(fwd) −∆H. Figures 6.12 and 6.13 show
the activation energies of forward and reverse reactions.
The top of the activation energy barrier on a potential energy diagram
represents the transition state , or change-over point, of the reaction. The
chemical species that exists at the transition state is referred to as the activated complex . The activated complex is a transitional species that is
neither product nor reactant. It has partial bonds and is highly unstable.There is a subtle difference between the transition state and the activatedcomplex. The transition state refers to the top of the “hill” on a potential
energy diagram. The chemical species that exists at this transition point is
called the activated complex.
Tracing a Reaction With a Potential Energy Diagram

−, ion and
methyl bromide, BrCH 3. Methanol, CH3OH, and a bromide, Br−, ion
are formed.

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 293As the reactants collide, chemical bonds break and form.
For a successful reaction to take place, BrCH 3and OH−must collide in a
favourable orientation. The OH−ion must approach BrCH 3from the side
that is opposite to the Br atom. When this occurs, a partial bond is formed
between the O of the OH−ion and the C atom. Simultaneously, the C /H11002Br
bond is weakened.
Because the activated complex contains partial bonds, it is highly
unstable. It can either break down to form products or it can decomposeto re-form the reactants. The activated complex is like a rock teetering ontop of a mountain. It could fall either way.Figure 6.14

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 295Temperature Dependence of Reaction Rates: Applications
As you saw in Figure 6.11, when reactions occur at higher temperatures,
the percent of particles that have suf ﬁcient kinetic energy to react ( Ea)
increases. Since a greater percent of reactant particles have enough energyto react, the rate of the reaction increases.
Chemists exploit the temperature dependence of reaction rates by
carrying out chemical reactions at elevated temperatures to speed themup. In organic chemistry, especially, reactions are commonly performedunder reﬂux : that is, while boiling the reactants. To prevent reactants and
products from escaping as gases, a water-cooled condenser tube is ﬁtted to
the reaction vessel. The tube condenses the vapours to liquids and returnsthem to the reaction vessel. Figure 6.15 shows an experiment performedunder re ﬂux.
At home, you take advantage of the temperature dependence of
chemical reactions all the time. For example, to keep your food fresh, you store it in a refrigerator. If you have ever left milk or vegetables in the refrigerator for several weeks, however, you have probably observedthat refrigeration does not stop food from spoiling. Instead, it decreases
the rateof the reactions that cause spoilage. When you want to cook your
food quickly, you increase the temperature of the stove. This increases the rate of the reactions that take place as the food cooks.
As the reactants are boiled under re ﬂux, the vapours
condense and are returned to the reaction vessel. In this way, a chemical reaction can be carried out at the boiling point of the reactants at atmospheric pressure, with no loss of reactants, products, or solvent.Figure 6.15clamp

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 297Reaction Mechanisms
and Catalysts
Chemical reactions are like factories, where goods (products) are created
from raw materials (reactants). An assembly line, like the one shown inFigure 6.16, involves many steps. An automobile is not formed from itscomponents in just one step. Similarly, most chemical reactions do notproceed immediately from products to reactants. They take place via anumber of steps. While you can go inside a factory to see all the steps thatare involved in making an automobile or a piece of clothing, you cannotobserve a chemical equation on a molecular scale as it proceeds. Chemistscan experimentally determine the reactants and products of a reaction, butthey must use indirect evidence to suggest the steps in-between.
Elementary Reactions
A reaction mechanism is a series of steps that make up an overall reaction.
Each step, called an elementary reaction , involves a single molecular
event, such as a simple collision between atoms, molecules, or ions. An elementary step can involve the formation of different molecules orions, or it may involve a change in the energy or geometry of the startingmolecules. It cannot be broken down into further, simpler steps.
For example, consider the following reaction.
2NO
(g)+O2(g)→2NO 2(g)
Chemists have proposed the following two-step mechanism for this
reaction. Each step is an elementary reaction.
Step 1 NO (g)+O2(g)→NO 3(g)
Step 2 NO 3(g)+NO (g)→2NO 2(g)
When you add the two elementary reactions, you get the overall reaction.
Notice that NO 3is present in both elementary reactions, but it is not pres-
ent in the overall reaction. It is produced in the ﬁrst step and consumed
in the second step.
Molecules (or atoms or ions) that are formed in an elementary reaction
and consumed in a subsequent elementary reaction are called reaction
intermediates . Even though they are not products or reactants in the over-
all reaction, reaction intermediates are essential for the reaction to takeplace. They are also useful for chemists who are trying to ﬁnd evidence to support a proposed reaction mecha-
nism. You will explore this idea in Investigation 6-B.
The Molecularity of Elementary Reactions
The term molecularity refers to the number of reactant particles (mole-
cules, atoms, or ions) that are involved in an elementary reaction.
In the reaction mechanism you just saw, each elementary
reaction consisted of two molecules colliding and reacting. When two par-ticles collide and react, the elementary reaction is said to be bimolecular .
Like most chemical
reactions, building a car on anassembly line takes more than one step.Figure 6.16
298 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionA unimolecular elementary reaction occurs when one molecule or
ion reacts. For example, when one molecule of chlorine absorbs ultravioletlight, the Cl
/H11002Cl bond breaks. The product is two chlorine atoms.
Cl2(g) 2Cl (g)
An elementary reaction may also involve three particles colliding in a
termolecular reaction. Termolecular elementary steps are rare, because
it is unlikely that three particles will collide all at once. Think of it thisway. You have probably bumped into someone accidentally, many times,on the street or in a crowded hallway. How many times, however, haveyou and two other people collided at exactly the same time? Figure 6.17models unimolecular, bimolecular, and termolecular reactions.
Rate Law Equations for Elementary Reactions
In section 6.2, you learned that the rate law equation for a chemical
reaction cannot be determined just by looking at the chemical equation. It must be found by experiment. Elementary reactions are the exception to this rule. For an elementary reaction, the exponents in the rate law
equation are the same as the stoichiometric coefﬁcients for each reactantin the chemical equation . Table 6.3 shows how rate laws correspond to
elementary reactions.
Table 6.3 Elementary Reactions and Their Rate Laws
Proposing and Evaluating Mechanisms
You can take apart a grandfather clock to take a look at its mechanism.
You can physically examine and take apart its gears and springs to deter-mine how it works.
When chemists investigate the mechanism of a reaction, they are
not so lucky. Determining the mechanism of a chemical reaction is a bitlike ﬁguring out how a clock works just by looking at its face and hands.
For this reason, reaction mechanisms are proposed rather than de ﬁnitively
stated. Much of the experimental evidence that is obtained to support a mechanism is indirect. Researchers need a lot of creativity as they propose and test mechanisms.
One of the ways that researchers provide evidence for proposed
mechanisms is by proving the existence of a reaction intermediate.Although a reaction intermediate usually appears for a very short timeand cannot be isolated, there are other ways to show its presence. Forexample, if a reaction intermediate is coloured while other reactants arecolourless, a spectrophotometer will show when the reaction intermediateis formed. You may even be able to see a ﬂeeting colour change without
a spectrophotometer.Elementary reaction Rate law

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 299When chemists propose a mechanism, they must satisfy the
following criteria:
•The equations for the elementary steps must combine to give the
equation for the overall reaction.
•The proposed elementary steps must be reasonable.
•The mechanism must support the experimentally determined rate law.
The Rate-Determining Step
How do chemists determine whether a proposed mechanism supports the
experimentally determined rate law? They must consider how the rates ofthe elementary reactions relate to the rate of the overall reaction.Elementary reactions in mechanisms all have different rates. Usually oneelementary reaction, called the rate-determining step , is much slower.
Hence, it determines the overall rate.
To understand the rate-determining step, consider a two-step process.
Suppose that you and a friend are making buttered toast for a large groupof people. The ﬁrst step is toasting the bread. The second step is buttering
the toast. Suppose that toasting two slices of bread takes about two minutes, but buttering the toast takes only a few seconds.
The rate at which the toast is buttered does not have any effect on
the overall rate of making buttered toast, because it is much faster thanthe rate at which the bread is toasted. The overall rate of making butteredtoast, therefore, depends only on the rate of toasting the bread. In otherwords, two pieces of buttered toast will be ready every two minutes. Thisis the same as the rate for the ﬁrst step in the “buttered toast mechanism. ”
Thus, toasting the bread is the rate-determining step in the mechanism.
Step 1 Bread →Toast (slow, rate-determining)
Step 2 Toast +Butter →Buttered toast (fast)
Now suppose that the butter is frozen nearly solid. It takes you about ﬁve
minutes to scrape off enough butter for one piece of toast. Pieces of toastpile up, waiting to be buttered. In this case, the rate of making butteredtoast depends on the rate of spreading the butter. The rate of toasting isfast relative to the rate of buttering.
Step 1 Bread →Toast (fast)
Step 2 Toast + Frozen butter →Buttered toast (slow, rate-determining)
The Rate-Determining Step and the Rate Law
How does the rate-determining step relate to the rate law for the overall
equation? Consider the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with chlorine.
2NO 2(g)+Cl2(g)→2NO 2Cl(g)
Experiments show that this reaction has the following rate equation.
Rate =k[NO 2][Cl 2]
The proposed mechanism for the reaction is shown below.
Step 1 NO 2(g)+Cl2(g)→NO 2Cl(g)+Cl(g) (slow)
Step 2 NO 2(g)+Cl(g)→NO 2Cl(g) (fast)
The mechanism seems reasonable, because the steps add up to give the
overall reaction. Both steps are plausible, because they are bimolecularelementary reactions. Does the reaction mechanism support, however, theexperimentally determined rate law?
300 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionThe ﬁrst step in the mechanism is slow when compared with the
second step. Therefore, the rate-determining step is step 1. Since the rateof the overall reaction depends on the rate of the slow step, the rate lawequation for the rate-determining step should match the rate law for theoverall reaction.
By de ﬁnition, the rate law equation for step 1 is written as follows:
Rate
1=k1[NO 2][Cl 2]
The rate law of the rate-determining step in the proposed mechanism
matches the experimentally determined rate law. Since the proposedmechanism is consistent with the overall rate law equation, it is a reasonable mechanism.
Problem
Consider the reaction below.
2NO (g)+2H2(g)→N2(g)+2H2O(g)
The experimentally determined rate law is written as follows:
Rate =k[NO]2[H2]
A chemist proposes the mechanism below for the reaction.
Step 1 2NO (g)+H2(g)→N2O(g)+H2O(g) (slow)
Step 2 N2O(g)+H2(g)→N2(g)+H2O(g) (fast)
Determine whether the proposed mechanism is reasonable.
What Is Required?
You need to determine whether the proposed mechanism is reasonable.
To do this, you need to answer the following questions:
•Do the steps add up to the overall reaction?
•Are the steps reasonable in terms of their molecularity?
•Is the proposed mechanism consistent with the experimentally determined rate law?
What Is Given?
You know the proposed mechanism, the overall reaction, and the ratelaw for the overall reaction.
Plan Your Strategy
Add the two reactions, and cancel out reaction intermediates. Check the molecularity of the steps. Determine the rate law equation for therate-determining step, and compare it to the overall rate law equation.
Act on Your Strategy
Add the two steps.
Step 1 2NO (g)+H2(g)→N2O(g)+H2O(g)
Step 2 N2O(g)+H2(g)→N2+H2O(g)
N2O(g)+2H2(g)+2NO (g)→N2O(g)+N2(g)+2H2O(g)
or
2NO (g)+2H2(g)→N2(g)+2H2O(g)Sample Problem
Evaluating a Proposed MechanismRate-determining steps can
occur anywhere in a reactionmechanism. If a slow step isnot the ﬁrst step of the mecha-
nism, however, the overall ratelaw is more complicated todetermine. One reason is thatfast reactions occurring earlyin a mechanism are oftenreversible —both the forward
and reverse reactions takeplace. (You will learn moreabout these reactions in Unit 4.) FACTCHEM
Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 301The two steps add up to give the overall reaction. The second step is
bimolecular, so it is chemically reasonable. The ﬁrst step is termolecular,
which is possible but rare. In the proposed mechanism, step 1 is therate-determining reaction. The rate law equation for the ﬁrst step is
written as follows:
Rate
1=k1[NO 2]2[H2]
The rate law equation for the slow step matches the rate law equation
for the overall reaction.
Based on the equations for the elementary reactions, the molecularity
of these reactions, and the rate law for the rate-determining step, thereaction mechanism seems reasonable.
Check Your Solution
The reaction intermediate in the proposed mechanism is N2O. When
adding the two steps, you were able to cancel out N2O.

302 MHR • Unit 3  Energy Changes and Rates of ReactionCatalysts
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction
without being consumed by the reaction. Catalysts are of tremendousimportance in all facets of chemistry, from the laboratory to industry.Many industrial reactions, for example, would not be economically viablewithout catalysts. Well over three million tonnes of catalysts are producedannually in North America.
How a Catalyst Works
A catalyst works by lowering the activation energy of a reaction so that a
larger fraction of the reactants have suf ﬁcient energy to react. It lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternative mechanism for the reaction.The potential energy diagram in Figure 6.18 shows the activation energyfor an uncatalyzed reaction and the activation energy for the same reaction with the addition of a catalyst.
In Figure 6.18, the catalyzed reaction consists of a two-step mechanism.
The uncatalyzed reaction consists of a one-step mechanism. To see how a catalyst works, in general, consider a simple, one-step, bimolecular reaction:
A+B→AB
A catalyst can increase the rate of this reaction by providing an alternative
mechanism with lower activation energy. A possible mechanism for thecatalyzed reaction is shown below.
Step 1 A+catalyst →A/H11002catalyst
Step 2 A/H11002catalyst +B→AB+catalyst
Overall reaction A+B→AB
Both steps are faster than the original, uncatalyzed reaction. Therefore,
although the overall reaction of the catalyzed mechanism has the samereactants and products as the uncatalyzed reaction, the catalyzed mecha-nism is faster. The chemical species A
/H11002catalyst is a reaction intermediate.
It is produced in step 1 but consumed in step 2. By contrast, the catalyst is regenerated in the reaction. It appears as a reactant in step 1 and as catalyzed*

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 303a product in step 2. Although the catalyst changes during the overall
reaction, it is regenerated unchanged at the endof the overall reaction.
Figure 6.19 shows the reaction of sodium potassium tartrate with
H2O2, catalyzed by cobaltous chloride, CoCl 2. The CoCl 2is pink in solu-
tion. Notice that the contents of the beaker brie ﬂy change colour to dark
green, suggesting the formation of a reaction intermediate. Also notice thatyou can see the regeneration of the catalyst when the reaction is over.
Catalysts are divided into two categories, depending on whether or not
they are in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous Catalysts
A homogeneous catalyst exists in the same phase as the reactants.
Homogeneous catalysts most often catalyze gaseous and aqueous reactions. For example, aqueous zinc chloride, ZnCl
2, is used to catalyze
the following reaction.
(CH 3)2CHOH (aq)+HCl (aq) (CH 3)2CHCl (aq)+H2O(/lscript)
The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, and the catalyst is soluble in
water. Therefore, ZnCl 2is a homogeneous catalyst when it is used with
this reaction.
Heterogeneous Catalysts
A heterogeneous catalyst exists in a phase that is different from the phase
of the reaction it catalyzes. An important industrial use of heterogeneouscatalysts is the addition of hydrogen to an organic compound that contains C
/H11005C double bonds. This process is called hydrogenation .
Consider the hydrogenation of ethylene, shown below.
H2C/H11005CH2(g)+H2(g) H3C/H11002CH3(g)
Without a catalyst, the reaction is very slow. When the reaction is catalyzed
by a metal such as palladium or platinum, however, the rate increases dramatically. The ethylene and hydrogen molecules form bonds with themetal surface. This weakens the bonds of the hydrogen and ethylene. TheH
/H11002H bonds of the hydrogen molecules break, and the hydrogen atoms are
somewhat stabilized because of their attraction to the metal. The hydrogenatoms react with the ethylene, forming ethane. Figure 6.20 shows thehydrogenation of ethylene to ethane.

You may ﬁnd the term “hydrogenation ” familiar. Some food products,
such as margarine and peanut butter, contain hydrogenated vegetable oils.Hydrogenation is used in the food industry to convert liquid vegetableoils, which contain carbon-carbon double bonds, to solid fats, such asshortening, which are fully saturated.
Biological Catalysts
Your body depends on reactions that are catalyzed by amazingly ef ﬁcient
and speci ﬁc biological catalysts. Biological catalysts are enormous protein
molecules called enzymes . Their molecular masses range from 15 000 to
1 000 000 g/mol.
Only a small portion of the enzyme, called the active site , is actually
involved in the catalysis reaction. In terms of the enzyme ’s overall shape,
the active site is like a nook or a fold in its surface. The reactant molecule,called the substrate in an enzyme reaction, binds to the active site. The
enzyme works by stabilizing the reaction ’s transition state.
Two models currently exist to explain how an enzyme and its substrate
interact. One model, called the lock and key model , suggests that an
enzyme is like a lock, and its substrate is like a key. The shape of the activesite on the enzyme exactly ﬁts the shape of the substrate. A second model,
called the induced ﬁt model , suggests that the active site of an enzyme
changes its shape to ﬁt its substrate. Figure 6.21 shows both models.
Diagram A shows the lock and key model of enzyme function. Diagram B
shows the induced- ﬁt model of enzyme function.
Enzymes are involved in many functions of the human body, including
digestion and metabolism. For example, the enzyme lactase is responsiblefor catalyzing the breakdown of lactose, a sugar found in milk. Peoplewho are lactose-intolerant are usually missing lactase, or they have insuf-ﬁcient amounts. If you are lactose-intolerant, you can take commercially
produced supplements that contain lactase.
In the following ThoughtLab, you will investigate other ways in
which industries use and produce catalysts.Figure 6.21+

Many reactions that produce useful compounds
proceed too slowly to be used in industries. Some reactions need to be carried out at high temperatures or pressures to proceed quickly. These conditions, however, are often expensive tomaintain. Therefore, chemists and engineers usecatalysts to speed up the reactions in order to obtainproducts at a reasonable rate and under reasonableconditions. Similarly, many necessary biologicalreactions would proceed too slowly to sustain lifewithout the presence of enzymes.

Chapter 6  Rates of Chemical Reactions • MHR 305In the Thought Lab above, you may have included the enzyme catalase
in your brainstormed list. Catalase in your blood is responsible for the“ﬁzzing ” you see when you use a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution to
disinfect a cut. When dilute hydrogen peroxide is poured on a cut, itdecomposes to oxygen gas and water. The decomposition reaction is catalyzed by catalase.
Have you ever opened an old bottle of hydrogen peroxide and noticed
that it has lost its potency? The hydrogen peroxide has decomposed, leav-ing you with a bottle of water. At room temperature, in the absence of acatalyst, the decomposition of H
2O2occurs very slowly, over a period of
months or years. With the help of a catalyst, however, the rate of the reac-tion can be increased to the point where it can be easily studied in a highschool laboratory.
In Investigation 6-B, you will write a detailed procedure to determine
the rate law for the catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Insteadof using catalase to catalyze the reaction, you will use an inorganic catalyst.

Dr. Maud L. Menten
Dr. Maud L. Menten, a leading researcher in the ﬁeld
of biochemistry, was born in Port Lambton, Ontario,in 1879. She grew up in rural British Columbia, whereshe had to take a canoe across the Fraser River everyday to get to school. Later, Menten returned toOntario to attend the University of Toronto. Uponreceiving her medical degree in 1911, she becameone of the ﬁrst female doctors in Canada.
Menten soon received international recognition
for her study of enzymes. From 1912 to 1913, sheworked at Leonor Michaelis ’ lab at the University of
Berlin. While conducting experiments on the break-down of sucrose by the enzyme called invertase,Menten and Michaelis were able to re ﬁne the work
of Victor Henri to explain how enzymes function. Afew years earlier, Henri had proposed that enzymesbind directly to their substrates. Michaelis andMenten obtained the precise measurements thatwere needed to support Henri ’s hypothesis. Using
the recently developed concept of pH, they were able to buffer their chemical reactions and therebycontrol the conditions of their experiments moresuccessfully than Henri. Their ﬁndings, published in
1913, provided the ﬁrst useful model of enzyme
function.
In the ground-breaking scienti ﬁc paper that
presented their work, Menten and Michaelis alsoderived an important mathematical formula. Thisformula describes the rate at which enzymes breakdown their substrates. It correlates the speed of the enzyme reaction with the concentrations of the enzyme and the substrate. Called the Michaelis-Menten equation, it remains fundamental to ourunderstanding of how enzymes catalyze reactions.
Menten remained an avid researcher all her life.
She worked long days, dividing her time betweenteaching at the University of Pittsburgh ’s School
of Medicine and working as a pathologist at theChildren ’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. She also worked
with her peers and students on more than 70 papersthat dealt with a wide range of medical topics. Inaddition to her work with Michaelis, Menten ’s contri-
butions to science include pioneering techniques forstudying the chemical composition of tissues andfor investigating the nature of hemoglobin in humanred blood cells.
It was not until 1949, only a year before retiring
from the University of Pittsburgh, that Mentenobtained a full professorship. Shortly after retiring,Menten joined the Medical Research Institute ofBritish Columbia to do cancer research. Sadly, illhealth forced her to cease her scienti ﬁc work only
a few years later. She spent her remaining days inLeamington, Ontario.
Although she was a brilliant medical researcher,
Menten ’s enthusiasm over ﬂowed beyond the
boundaries of science. She was a world traveller, a mountain climber, a musician, and a student oflanguages. She was even a painter, whose workmade its way into art exhibitions.
In honour of her lifetime of achievements,
Maud L. Menten was inducted into the CanadianMedical Hall of Fame in 1998.
Section Summary
In this section, you learned that chemical reactions usually proceed as a
series of steps called elementary reactions. You related the equations forelementary reactions to rate laws. You learned how the relative speed ofthe steps in a reaction mechanism help to predict the rate law of an over-all reaction. Finally, you learned how a catalyst controls the rate of achemical reaction by providing a lower-energy reaction mechanism. Inthis chapter, you compared activation energies of forward and reversereactions. In the next unit, you will study, in detail, reactions that proceedin both directions.

Historians suspect that many ancient Romans suffered from lead
poisoning. The ancient Romans used lead for their plumbing system(hence, the Latin name for the element). Lead is a poison because itcan form strong bonds with proteins, including enzymes. Lead andother heavy metals react with enzymes by binding to functional groupson their active sites. When lead binds to a protein, such as an enzyme,the protein often precipitates out of solution.

UNIT 3 Project
Developing a Bulletin
About Catalysts andEnzymes
Background
Scientists have studied the amazing properties of
enzymes and catalysts for more than 200 years. In 1794, the English chemist Elizabeth Fulhamepublished a book called An Essay on Combustion .
Her book included many of the ﬁrst recorded ideasabout the role of catalysis in chemical processes. In particular, Fulhame was interested in the catalytic properties of the hydrogen and oxygenatoms in water.
Fulhame’s ideas about inorganic catalysts were
swept under by the fast and furious debate of herscientiﬁc era. Many of the most prominent scientistsof her day were arguing over whether organic reactions needed living organisms to occur. Manyscientists believed that a vital force was present
in living organisms and was essential for the formation of all organic compounds. For example,the fermentation of sugar into alcohol takes placethrough the action of yeast, a living organism. Scientists argued that it was impossible to produce
alcohol, an organic compound, without the actionof yeast, or some other living organism.
Although no one realized it at the time,
Fulhame’s ideas on catalysts were directly relevantto the debate on vital force. There is no mysteriousvital force in living organisms. Instead, organicreactions in living organisms depend on organiccatalysts called enzymes.
In 1828, the German chemist Friedrich Wohler
discovered that urea, an organic compound, couldbe produced in a laboratory without any help froma living organism. Wohler’s discovery inspiredother scientists to hypothesize that the fermentationof sugar into alcohol could also occur without thepresence of living organisms, such as yeast. Somescientists went further, and insisted that yeast wasnot even a living organism.
Eventually, scientists proved that fermentation
did not require whole cells of yeast. Fermentationcould still occur if non-living extracts of yeast werepresent. Through further study and experimentation,the important component in the yeast extract wasidentiﬁed as an enzyme. If earlier scientists had considered Fulhame’s ideas on catalysts, they mighthave arrived at the truth about enzymes sooner!
Over time, scientists have built up a large body
of knowledge about many different catalysts andenzymes. This knowledge has been put to good use in industry. Difﬁcult and expensive industrialprocesses have been made faster, cheaper, and easier through the use of catalysts and enzymes. Forexample, enzymes are used in the pharmaceuticalindustry, in paper-making and recycling processes,and in the petroleum industry. Many more industrial
uses of catalysts and enzymes are possible, andresearch into catalysts continues.

40.Suppose that you are having a new home builtin a rural area, where natural gas is not avail-able. You have two choices for fuelling yourfurnace:
•propane, C
3H8, delivered as a liquid under
pressure and stored in a tank
•home heating oil, delivered as a liquid (not
under pressure) and stored in a tank
What factors do you need to consider in orderto decide on the best fuel? What assumptionsdo you need to make?

Photochromic lenses darken in

The molten glass contains
dissolved silver chloride. As thesolution cools, silver chloride precipitates, forming tiny silverchloride crystals. Light strikingthese crystals produces silver andchlorine atoms. The silver atomstend to clump together to form particles that are big enough toblock light and darken the glass.
Adding copper(I) chloride to
the molten glass makes the processreversible. When light intensitydiminishes, copper ions removeelectrons from silver atoms, convert-ing the silver atoms into silver ions.The silver ions then migrate back to the silver chloride crystals. Theglass becomes transparent again.

Your body contains over 1 kg of nitrogen, mainly in the proteins and
nucleic acids that make up your cells. Your body, however, cannot absorbnitrogen directly from the atmosphere. You get the nitrogen-containingcompounds you need by eating plants and other foods.
Plants cannot absorb nitrogen directly from the atmosphere, either.
Their roots absorb nitrogen compounds—mainly nitrates—from the soil.Some of these nitrates result from atmospheric chemical reactions thatinvolve nitrogen and oxygen. First, lightning supplies the energy that isneeded to form nitric oxide from nitrogen and oxygen. The resulting nitricoxide combines with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide, which reacts withrainwater to form nitric acid. Then, in the seas and the soil at Earth’s surface, nitric acid ionizes to produce nitrate, NO
3−. Plants and plant-like
organisms can readily absorb nitrate.
Scientists call this chemical “circle of life” the nitrogen cycle . There
are, as you know, similar, equally important cyclic processes in nature.Each process involves reversible changes : changes that may proceed in
either direction, from reactants to products or from products to reactants.
In this chapter, you will study factors that affect reversible changes,
notably those in chemical reactions. You will learn how to determine theamounts of reactants and products that are present when their proportionsno longer change. You will also learn how to make qualitative predictionsabout the ways that chemists can change these proportions. Finally, youwill see how industrial chemists apply their knowledge of reversiblechanges to increase the yield of chemicals that are important to society.

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 323Recognizing Equilibrium
In Unit 3, you learned that the rate of any reaction depends on the
concentration of the reacting chemicals. As a reaction proceeds, the concentrations of the “product” chemicals increases, and the reverse reaction may re-form “reactants.” Under certain conditions, the rate of the reverse reaction increases as the rate of the forward reaction decreases.Eventually, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reversereaction. Equilibrium occurs when opposing changes, such as those just
described, are occurring simultaneously at the same rate.
How can you recognize equilibrium? In the following paragraphs, you
will read about physical changes that may or may not involve a system at equilibrium. As you consider these changes, note which systems are atequilibrium and what changes are taking place. Also note the conditionsthat would be needed for the changes to occur in the opposite direction atthe same rate. The ExpressLab that follows these descriptions will add toyour understanding of equilibrium. It will help you recognize systems thatare at equilibrium and systems that are not.
•A puddle of water remains after a summer shower. The puddle evapo-
rates because some of the water molecules near the surface have enoughkinetic energy to escape from the liquid. At the same time, some watermolecules in the air may condense back into the liquid. The chance of this happening is small, however. The puddle soon evaporates completely, as shown in Figure 7.1(A).
•Even if you put a lid on a jar of water, some of the water in the jar
evaporates. Careful measurements show that the level of liquid water in the jar initially decreases because more water evaporates than condenses. As the number of water vapour molecules increases, however, some condense back into the liquid. Eventually, the number of evaporating molecules and the number of condensing molecules are equal. The level of water inside the jar remains constant. At thispoint, shown in Figure 7.1(B), equilibrium has been reached.
Why is (B) an example of equilibrium, while (A) is not? Figure 7.1A B

you place a few small crystals in a beaker of water, water moleculesbreak apart the ions and they enter into the solution. A few ions in the solution may re-attach to the crystals. Because more ions enter thesolution than re-attach to the crystals, however, all the solid eventuallydissolves. If you keep adding crystals of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate,the solution eventually becomes saturated. Crystals remain at the bottom of the beaker, as shown in Figure 7.2.

326 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumConditions That Apply to All Equilibrium Systems
The fundamental requirement for equilibrium is that opposing changes
must occur at the same rate. There are many processes that reach equilibrium. Three physical processes that reach equilibrium are
•a solid in contact with a solution that contains this solid: for example,
sugar crystals in a saturated aqueous sugar solution
•the vapour above a pure liquid: for example, a closed jar that contains
liquid water
•the vapour above a pure solid: for example, mothballs in a closed drawer
Two chemical processes that reach equilibrium are
•a reaction with reactants and products in the same phase: for example,
a reaction between two gases to produce a gaseous product. In thischapter, you will focus on reactions in which the reactants and products are in the same phase. The equilibrium they reach is calledhomogeneous equilibrium .
•a reaction in which reactants and products are in different phases:
for example, an aqueous solution of ions, in which the ions combine toproduce a slightly soluble solid that forms a precipitate. In Chapters 8and 9, you will work extensively with reactions in which the reactantsand products are in different phases. The equilibrium they reach iscalled heterogeneous equilibrium .
What is it that equilibrium systems like these have in common? What con-
ditions are necessary for equilibrium to become established? As outlinedin the box below, there are four conditions that apply to all equilibriumsystems.
The Four Conditions That Apply to All Equilibrium Systems
3.Equilibrium can only be reached in a closed system. A closed systemis a system that does not allow the input or escape of any componentof the equilibrium system, including energy. For this reason, a system can be at equilibrium only if it is at constant temperature. A common example of a closed system is carbon dioxide gas that is in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide in a soda drink.You can summarize the ﬁrst two equilibrium conditions by stating that
equilibrium involves dynamic change at the molecular level but no changeat the macroscopic level .2.The observable (macroscopic) properties of a system at equilibrium
are constant. At equilibrium, there is no overall change in the properties that depend on the total quantity of matter in the system. Examples of these properties include colour, pressure, concentration, and pH. 1.Equilibrium is achieved in a reversible process when the rates ofopposing changes are equal. A double arrow, /arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf, indicates reversible
changes. For example:
H
2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfH2O(g)
H2(g)+Cl2(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2HCl (g)A decomposition reaction is

does the concentration ofreactant have to equal theconcentration of product?Explain your answer.
Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 327Section Summary
In this section, you learned how to recognize equilibrium. As well,
you learned about the conditions that are needed for equilibrium to bereached. Later in this chapter, you will examine what happens when some equilibrium conditions in a system are changed. You will learn how chemists can control conditions to increase the yield of reactions.
Energy is an important component of most equilibrium systems. The
input or output of energy in a system causes the temperature to change.Thus, the requirement that an equilibrium system be closed means thatthe temperature of the system must remain constant. In the next section,you will examine more closely the effects of thermodynamics on equilibrium systems. In particular, you will examine the factors that affect the amount of reactant and product in a reaction and the factors that determine whether or not a reaction is spontaneous.
Give two physical and two chemical processes that are
examples of reversible changes that are not at equilibrium.
Explain, in terms of reaction rates, how the changes that take
place in a reversible reaction approach equilibrium.

the proportions of H2(g), Cl2(g), and HCl (g)(in a closed container at
constant temperature) are the same at equilibrium, regardless ofwhether you started with H
2(g)and Cl(g)or whether you started
with HCl (g).The system remains at equilibrium as long as the container is not
opened. Note that small changes to the components of a system aresometimes negligible. Thus, equilibrium principles can be applied if a system is not physically closed. For example, consider the equilibrium of a solid in a saturated aqueous solution, such as
CaO
(s)+H2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfCa2+(aq)+2OH−(aq). You can neglect the small
amount of water that vaporizes from the open beaker during anexperiment.

Specific Expectations  Thermodynamics and Equilibrium
You can easily predict what will happen in a number of physical and
chemical processes. What will happen if you let go of a pencil that youare holding tip-down on a table? What will you observe if you add a fewdrops of food colouring to some water in a glass? If a piece of paper startsto burn in a plentiful supply of air, what are the products of the reaction?How will an iron nail change if it is left outside? These are all examplesof favourable (or spontaneous ) changes. A favourable change is a change
that has a natural tendency to happen under certain conditions.
What Conditions Favour a Change?
What conditions determine whether or not a change is favourable? Howare different conditions related to equilibrium, where forward and reversechanges occur at the same rate? The answers to these questions are linkedto two important concepts in thermodynamics: enthalpy and entropy.
Enthalpy and Favourable Changes
Energy is a key condition in favourable changes. For example, you know
that a ball always rolls downhill. Its gravitational potential energy islower at the bottom of the hill than at the top. For the ball to roll uphill —
an unfavourable (or non-spontaneous) change —you have to apply energy
to the ball. Chemical reactions are similar. When products have lessenthalpy than reactants, the reaction releases energy. Therefore, the reaction is exothermic. Are favourable changes those that are exothermicunder certain conditions?
Certainly many favourable physical and chemical changes are
exothermic. Some favourable changes, however, involve no release ofenergy. Others are actually endothermic. For example, a favourableendothermic chemical reaction occurs when barium hydroxide andammonium thiocyanate are placed in an Erlenmeyer ﬂask, as shown
in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH)
2•8H2O(s)+2NH 4SCN (s)→Ba(SCN) 2(aq) +10H 2O(/lscript)+2NH 3(g)
∆H=+170 kJ
When the ﬂask is stoppered and the contents are shaken, the solids
intermingle. The reaction produces a slush-like mixture. This favourable,but endothermic, reaction absorbs enough energy to freeze a thin layer ofwater under the ﬂask.
A BA favourable
endothermic reaction occurs whenbarium hydroxide is mixed withammonium thiocyanate. If youremoved the stopper in photograph(B), you would detect the charac-teristic odour of ammonia.Figure 7.4
Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 329Temperature and Favourable Changes
Another condition that determines whether or not a particular reaction is
favoured is temperature. Consider the reversible synthesis reactionbetween mercury and oxygen, and the decomposition of mercury(II) oxide.
Hg
(/lscript)+1
2O2(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfHgO (s) ∆H=±90.8 kJ
From left to right, the reaction is exothermic. Therefore, the enthalpy
change, ∆H, is negative. If the enthalpy change was the only condition
that determined whether a reaction is favourable, then the synthesis reaction would take place. The synthesis reaction does take place —but
only at relatively moderate temperatures. Above 400 ˚C, the reverse
reaction is favourable. The decomposition of HgO
(s)occurs. Thus, the
direction in which this reaction proceeds depends on temperature. This is fundamentally different from the dependence of reaction rate on temperature that you learned about in Unit 3. The reaction between
Hg
(/lscript), O2(g), and HgO (s)does not just change its rate with a change in
temperature, it changes its direction .
Temperature and Enthalpy Alone
Cannot Explain Favourable Reactions
Temperature and enthalpy are not the only conditions that determine
whether a change is favourable. Consider the process shown in Figure 7.5.A closed valve links two ﬂasks together. The left ﬂask contains an ideal
gas. The right ﬂask is evacuated. When the valve is opened, you expect the
gas to diffuse into the evacuated ﬂask until the pressure in both ﬂasks is
equal. You do not expect to see the reverse process —with all the gas mole-
cules ending up in one of the ﬂasks—unless work is done on the system.
If the gas is ideal, this favourable change involves no change in energy. Why
must the gas be ideal?
The process shown in Figure 7.5 is certainly a favourable change. Yet no
exchange of energy is involved. The condition that in ﬂuences this change
is called entropy. It is an important condition in all physical and chemicalchanges.
Entropy and Favourable Changes
Entropy , S, is the tendency toward randomness or disorder in a system.
It is also a thermodynamic property that can be measured. It can be usedto describe qualitative changes in energy.
An ordered arrangement of particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) has
lower entropy (smaller disorder) than the same number of particles in random arrangements. Thus, the entropy of a pure substance depends onits state. The entropy of a system increases (becomes more disordered)with temperature, because the motion of particles becomes more chaoticat higher temperatures. See Figure 7.6 on the next page.Figure 7.5closed valveflask with ideal gas evacuated flask ideal gas in both flasks
open valve
330 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe entropy of the particles in a sample of matter increases as the matter
changes state from solid to liquid to gas.
The mathematical de ﬁnition of entropy describes the probability of a
given arrangement of particles. A system of moving particles with lowentropy probably has greater order than a similar system with higher
entropy. Why say “probably ”? Consider gas molecules in a container at
room temperature. The gas molecules are moving rapidly, colliding withother molecules and the walls of the container. They have relatively largeentropy. What if two different gases occupy the same container? It is pos-sible, in principle, for the gases to separate so they are on opposite sidesof the container. Given the huge number of particles, however, the proba-bility of this happening is so close to zero that chemists say it will neverhappen. Nevertheless, it remains possible. The outcome is not certain.
As you know from Unit 3, chemists often use the terms “system ” and
“surroundings ” to describe a chemical reaction. The system is the reaction
itself —the reactants and products. The surroundings are everything else
in the universe. According to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics (the law
of conservation of energy) the algebraic sum of the energy changes in a system and its surroundings is zero. Unlike energy, entropy is not conserved. The total amount of entropy is increasing. This is part of thesecond law of thermodynamics : the total entropy of the universe is
constantly increasing. The key word here is “total. ” If you are studying
a system, you must add together changes in the entropy of the system,
∆S
sys, and changes in the entropy of the surroundings, ∆Ssurr.
Consider what happens to you and your classmates (the particles in a
“system ”) on your way to class. Initially, you and your classmates are in
different places in the school, walking with different velocities toward theclassroom. Going to class represents a relatively large amount of entropy.The ﬁnal state of the system, when everyone is seated, represents a Figure 7.6
solid liquid
increasing entropygas
Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 331smaller amount of entropy. Thus, the entropy of the system decreased.
How, then, did the entropy of the universe increase?
The answer to this question involves changes to the surroundings.
Each of you, on your way to class, metabolized energy. The movementand heat from your bodies added to the entropy of the air particles aroundyou. In fact, the increase in the entropy of the surroundings was greaterthan the decrease in the entropy of the system. Therefore, the totalentropy of the universe increased.
What does entropy have to do with favourable chemical changes and
equilibrium systems? All favourable changes involve an increase in the
total amount of entropy . Recall the endothermic reaction in Figure 7.4.
Ba(OH)
2•8H2O(s)+2NH 4SCN (s)→Ba(SCN) 2(aq) +10H 2O(/lscript)+2NH 3(g)
∆H=+170 kJ
The reaction is favourable, partly because the reactants are two solids and
the products are a solution, water, and a gas. The products have a muchlarger entropy than the reactants. This helps to make the reactionfavourable.
Now recall the reaction between mercury and oxygen. It favours
the formation of HgO below about 400 ˚C, but the decomposition of HgO
above 400 ˚C. This reaction highlights the importance of temperature to
favourable change. Enthalpy, entropy, and temperature are linked in aconcept called free energy.
Free Energy and Equilibrium
Imagine a perfect engine —an engine without any friction between its
moving parts. This engine would still be unable to convert all the energyin a fuel into useful work. The reason is that some energy, such as theenergy of the hot exhaust, is used to increase the entropy of the surround-ings. The term free energy means available energy. In a chemical change,
free energy is a measure of the useful work that can be obtained from areaction. Free energy is often called Gibbs free energy , and given the
symbol G, in honour of Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839 –1903). Gibbs, a
professor of chemistry at Harvard University, developed the concept of free energy and the equations that describe it.
The change in the free energy of a system, ∆G, at constant temperature
is given by the equation ∆G=∆H−T∆S. In this equation, as in most
chemistry equations, the temperature, T, must be in Kelvin degrees. The
symbol ∆Hrepresents the change in enthalpy. The symbol ∆Srepresents
the change in entropy.
The value of ∆Gfor a chemical reaction tells us whether the reaction is a
source of useful energy. Such energy can be converted into another form,such as mechanical energy to drive machinery or electrical energy in abattery. The rest of the energy from the reaction enters the environment asheat. It increases the entropy of the surroundings. ∆G = ∆H − T∆S

The concept of free energy
appears in other areas of science, notably biology. Find out the meanings of the terms “exergonic” and“endergonic.” How are theseterms related to free energy?LINK Biology
332 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe equation ∆G=∆H−T∆S, and the sign of ∆G, can help to explain
why some chemical reactions are favourable at room temperature, whyothers are not, and how temperature affects the direction of a reaction.The change in the free energy of a chemical reaction is related to the direction of the reaction and to equilibrium as follows:
•When ∆Gis negative, the forward reaction is favourable.
•When ∆Gis zero, the reaction is at equilibrium.
•When ∆Gis positive, the reaction is favourable in the reverse direction
but not in the forward direction.
Exothermic reactions are often favourable because the sign of ∆His
negative. The equation shows that exothermic reactions are unfavourableonly when ∆Sis negative and the value of −T∆Sis large enough to make
∆Gpositive. This is what happens in the reaction between mercury
and oxygen.
Hg
(/lscript)+1
2O2(g)→HgO (s) ∆H=−90.8 kJ
From left to right, the reaction is exothermic. There is a decrease in
entropy because gas molecules react to form a solid. At temperaturesgreater than about 400 ˚C (673 K), the value of −T∆Sis positive and greater
than 90.8 kJ. Thus, ∆Gbecomes positive. The forward reaction is no
longer favourable, as experiments con ﬁrm.
In most reactions, the entropy of the system increases ( Sis positive),
so the value of −T∆Sis negative. Therefore, most reactions tend to be
more favourable at higher temperatures. At low temperatures, reactionsare likely to be favourable only if they are highly exothermic.
Section Summary
Table 7.1 shows how you can use the signs of ∆Hand ∆Sto determine
whether a chemical reaction is favourable. It also shows how ∆Hand ∆S
may vary with temperature. Keep in mind that a favourable reaction maybe fast or slow. Thermodynamics makes no prediction about the rate of areaction, only whether or not it can take place. Also, before any reactionbegins, the activation energy must be supplied.

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 333Note that the entropy of a system cannot increase forever. Eventually,
a maximum state of disorder is reached. When this happens, the systemappears to have constant properties, even though changes are still takingplace at the molecular level. We say that a chemical system is at equilibri-um when it has constant observable properties. Therefore, equilibriumoccurs when a system has reached its maximum entropy. In the next section, you will look more closely at the reactants and products of chemical systems and learn how equilibrium is measured.
Explain the difference between a favourable chemical change
and an unfavourable chemical change. Give two examples of each type of change.
Write a short paragraph, or use a graphic organizer, to show
the relationship among the following concepts: favourable chemicalchange, temperature, enthalpy, entropy, free energy.
In each process, how does the entropy of the system change?
(a)ice melting (d)HCl (g)+NH 3(g)→NH 4Cl(s)
(b)water vapour condensing (e)CaCO 3(s)→CaO (s)+CO2(g)
(c)sugar dissolving in water
What is the sign of the entropy change in each chemical
reaction?
(a)N2O4(g)→2NO 2(g) (d)N2(g)+3H2(g)→2NH 3(g)
(b)PCl 3(g)+Cl2(g)→PCl 5(g) (e)S(s)+O2(g)→SO2(g)
(c)2Al (s)+3
2O2(g)→Al2O3(s)
When water freezes, the phase change that occurs is exothermic.
H2O(/lscript)→H2O(s)∆H=−6.02 kJ
Based on the change in enthalpy, you would expect that water would
always freeze. Use the concepts of entropy and free energy to explainwhy this phase change is favourable only below 0 ˚C.I 5K/U 4K/U 3C 2K/U 1Section Review

Specific Expectations  The Equilibrium Constant
Chemists use both thermodynamics and rate to study chemical reactions.
Thermodynamics determines whether a reaction will occur at a certain
temperature and when equilibrium will be reached. The rate of a reaction
determines the time it takes for a certain concentration of product to form.
In this section, you will learn about the extent of a reaction: the relative
concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium.
Opposing Rates and the Law of Chemical Equilibrium
In 1864, two Norwegian chemists, Cato Guldberg and Peter Waage, summarized their experiments on chemical equilibrium in the law of
chemical equilibrium : At equilibrium, there is a constant ratio between
the concentrations of the products and reactants in any change .
Figure 7.7 shows how the law of chemical equilibrium applies to onechemical system. Chemists have studied this system extensively. Itinvolves the reversible reaction between two gases: dinitrogen tetroxide,which is colourless, and nitrogen dioxide, which is dark brown.
N
2O4(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2NO 2(g)
colourless brown
By observing the intensity of the brown colour in the mixture, chemists
can determine the concentration of nitrogen dioxide.
As this system nears equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction decreases
and the rate of the reverse reaction increases. At equilibrium, the macroscopic properties ofthis system are constant. Changes at the molecular level take place at equal rates.Figure 7.7

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 335Dinitrogen tetroxide gas is produced by vaporizing dinitrogen
tetroxide liquid. Dinitrogen tetroxide liquid boils at 21 ˚C. If a small
quantity is placed in a sealed ﬂask at 100 ˚C, it vaporizes, ﬁlling the ﬂask
with dinitrogen tetroxide gas.
Suppose that the initial concentration of N2O4(g)is 0.0200 mol/L.
The initial concentration of NO 2(g)is zero. The initial rate of the forward
reaction, kf, is relatively large, while the initial rate of the reverse
reaction, kr, is zero. The initial conditions correspond to the ﬁrst
exchange in the ExpressLab on page 325, where the reactant cylinder wasfull and the product cylinder was empty. As the reaction proceeds, therate of the forward reaction decreases because the concentration of N
2O4(g)
decreases. At the same time, the rate of the reverse reaction increases
because the concentration of NO 2(g)increases. At equilibrium, kf=kr.
There are no further changes in the relative amounts of N2O4and NO 2.
The Equilibrium Constant
From other experiments involving the reaction between nitrogen
tetroxide and nitrogen dioxide, chemists know that both the forward and reverse reactions involve elementary steps. Thus, you can write rateequations for the reactions.
Forward reaction: N
2O4(g)→2NO 2(g) Reverse reaction: 2NO 2(g)→N2O4(g)
Forward rate: kf[N2O4] Reverse rate: kf[NO 2]2
At equilibrium,
Foward rate =Reverse rate
kf[N2O4]=kr[NO 2]2
The ratio of rate constants is another constant. The forward rate constant,
kf, divided by the reverse rate constant, kr, is called the equilibrium
constant , Keq.kf
kr=Keq=[NO 2]2
[N2O4]
You can write rate equations for these reactions because they are
elementary mechanisms. Guldberg and Waage, however, showed that similar results are found for any reaction, regardless of the mechanism.For any general equilibrium equation, let P, Q, R, and S represent chemical formulas and a, b, c, and drepresent their respective
coefﬁcients in the chemical equation.

This equilibrium expression depends only on the stoichiometry of the

Writing Equilibrium Expressions
Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 337The Equilibrium Constant and Temperature
Adding a chemical that is involved in a reaction at equilibrium increases
the rate at which this chemical reacts. The rate, however, decreases as theconcentration of the added chemical decreases. Eventually, equilibrium is re-established with the same equilibrium constant. For a given systemat equilibrium, the value of the equilibrium constant depends only ontemperature. Changing the temperature of a reacting mixture changes therate of the forward and reverse reactions by different amounts, becausethe forward and reverse reactions have different activation energies. Areacting mixture at one temperature has an equilibrium constant whosevalue changes if the mixture is allowed to reach equilibrium at a differenttemperature.
The numerical value of the equilibrium constant does not depend
on whether the starting point involves reactants or products. These are just labels that chemists use to identify particular chemicals in thereaction mixture. Also, at a given temperature, the value of K
cdoes not
depend on the starting concentrations. The reaction gives the same ratioof products and reactants according to the equilibrium law. Remember,however, that K

system is at equilibrium .

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 339Measuring Equilibrium Concentrations
The equilibrium constant, Kc, is calculated by substituting equilibrium
concentrations into the equilibrium expression. Experimentally, thismeans that a reaction mixture must come to equilibrium. Then one ormore properties are measured. The properties that are measured dependon the reaction. Common examples for gaseous reactions include colour,pH, and pressure. From these measurements, the concentrations of thereacting substances can be determined. Thus, you do not need to measureall the concentrations in the mixture at equilibrium. You can determinesome equilibrium concentrations if you know the initial concentrations of the reactants and the concentration of one product at equilibrium.
For example, a mixture of iron(III) nitrate and potassium thiocyanate,
in aqueous solution, react to form the iron(III) thiocyanate ion,
Fe(SCN)
2+(aq). The reactant solutions are nearly colourless. The product
solution ranges in colour from orange to blood-red, depending on its concentration. The nitrate and potassium ions are spectators. Therefore,the net ionic equation is
Fe
3+(aq)+SCN−(aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfFe(SCN)2+(aq)
colourless red
Because the reaction involves a colour change, you can determine the
concentration of Fe(SCN)2+(aq)by measuring the intensity of the colour.
You will ﬁnd out how to do this in Investigation 7-A. For now, assume
that it can be done. From the measurements of colour intensity, you can calculate the equilibrium concentration of Fe(SCN)
2+(aq). Then,
knowing the initial concentration of each solution, you can calculate the equilibrium concentration of each ion using the chemical equation.
Suppose, for instance, that the initial concentration of Fe
3+(aq)is
0.0064 mol/L and the initial concentration of SCN−(aq)is 0.0010 mol/L.
When the solutions are mixed, the red complex ion forms. By measuringthe intensity of its colour, you can determine that the concentration of
Fe(SCN)
2+(aq)is 4.5×10−4mol/L . From the stoichiometry of the equation,
each mole of Fe(SCN)2+(aq)forms when equal amounts of Fe3+(aq)and
SCN−(aq)react. So, if there is 4.5×10−4mol/L of Fe(SCN)2+(aq)at
equilibrium, then the same amounts of both Fe3+(aq)and SCN−(aq)must
have reacted. This represents the change in their concentrations. Theequilibrium concentration of a reacting species is the sum of its initialconcentration and the change that results from the reaction. Therefore, the concentration of Fe
3+(aq)at equilibrium is (0.0064 −0.000 45) mol/L =
0.005 95 mol/L, or 0.0060 mol/L. You can calculate the equilibrium concentration of SCN
−(aq)the same way, and complete the table below.
Finally, you can calculate Kcby substituting the equilibrium
concentrations into the equilibrium expression.
In the following investigation, you will collect experimental data
to determine an equilibrium constant.Concentration (mol/L)

The colour intensity of a solution is related to the
concentration of the ions and the depth of thesolution. By adjusting the depth of a solutionwith unknown concentration until it has thesame intensity as a solution with known concen-tration, you can determine the concentration of the unknown solution. For example, if the concentration of a solution is lower than the standard, the depth of the solution has to begreater in order to have the same colour intensity.Thus, the ratio of the concentrations of two solu-tions with the same colour intensity is inverselyproportional to the ratio of their depths.

2+ions in each
mixture by comparing the colour intensity of themixture with the colour intensity of a solutionthat has known concentration. After you ﬁnd
the concentration of Fe(SCN)

use it to calculate the concentrations of the other two ions at equilibrium. You will substitutethe three concentrations for each mixture into the equilibrium expression to determine the equilibrium constant.

This is close to the given value, Kc=8.3. The difference is due to

348 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumQualitatively Interpreting the Equilibrium Constant
The Sample Problem on page 344 showed how to calculate the amounts of
gases at equilibrium for the following reaction.
CO(g)+H2O(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfH2(g)+CO2(g)
Recall that the equilibrium constant for this reaction was 8.3 at 700 K.
1.0 mol of CO(g)and 1.0 mol of H2O(g)were put in a 5.0 L container. At
equilibrium, 0.48 mol of H2(g)and 0.48 mol of CO2(g)were present. The
starting amounts were in stoichiometric ratios. Consequently, if the reac-tion had gone to completion, there would have been no limiting reactant.You would have expected 1.0 mol of both H
2(g)and CO2(g). Thus, you can
calculate the percent yield of the reaction as follows:
Percent yield =Equilibrium [H 2]×100%
Maximum [H 2]
=0.48 ×100%
1.0
=48%
This value indicates the extent of the reaction. It is linked to the size of
Kc. As you know, the equilibrium expression is always written with the
product terms over the reactant terms. Therefore, a large Kcmeans that the
concentration of products is larger than the concentration of reactants atequilibrium. When referring to a reaction with a large K
c, chemists often
say that the position of equilibrium lies to the right, or that it favours theproducts. Similarly, if K
cis small, the concentration of reactants is larger
than the concentration of products. Chemists say that the position of equilibrium lies to the left, or that it favours reactants. Thus, the following general statements are true:
•When K >1, products are favoured . The equilibrium lies far to the right.
Reactions where Kis greater than 10
10are usually regarded as going to
completion.
•When K ≈1, there are approximately equal concentrations of reactants
and products at equilibrium .
•When K < 1, reactants are favoured . The equilibrium lies far to the left.
Reactions in which K is smaller than 10−10are usually regarded as not
taking place at all.
Notice that the subscript “c” has been left off Kin these general state-
ments. This re ﬂects the fact that there are other equilibrium constants
that these statements apply to, not just equilibrium constants involvingconcentrations. You will learn about other types of equilibrium constantsin the next two chapters. For the rest of this chapter, though, you willcontinue to see the subscript “c” used.0.055 mol of CO(g)and 0.072 mol of Cl2(g)are placed in a 5.0 L

Phosgene is a product in the chemical equation. A greater concentration
of product corresponds to a larger value of Kc.
Act on Your Strategy
The value of Kcis larger at 370 K. The position of equilibrium lies far
to the right. It favours the formation of COCl 2at the lower temperature.
Check Your Solution
The problem asked you to choose the temperature for a larger concentra-
tion of the product. Kcis expressed as a fraction with product terms in

350 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe Meaning of a Small Equilibrium Constant
Understanding the meaning of a small equilibrium constant can
sometimes help to simplify a calculation that would otherwise involve a quadratic equation. When K
cis small compared with the initial concen-
tration, the value of the initial concentration minus xis approximately
equal to the initial concentration. Thus, you can ignore x. Of course, if the
initial concentration of a substance is zero, any equilibrium concentrationof the substance, no matter how small, is signi ﬁcant. In general, values
of K
care not measured with accuracy better than 5%. Therefore, making
the approximation is justi ﬁed if the calculation error you introduce is
less than 5%.
To help you decide whether or not the approximation is justi ﬁed,
divide the initial concentration by the value of Kc. If the answer is greater
than 500, the approximation is justi ﬁed. If the answer is between 100 and
500, it may be justi ﬁed. If the answer is less than 100, it is not justi ﬁed.
The equilibrium expression must be solved in full.

Specific Expectations  Predicting the
Direction of a Reaction
So far in this chapter, you have worked with reactions that have reached
equilibrium. What if a reaction has not yet reached equilibrium, however?How can you predict the direction in which the reaction must proceed toreach equilibrium? To do this, you substitute the concentrations of reac-tants and products into an expression that is identical to the equilibriumexpression. Because these concentrations may not be the concentrationsthat the equilibrium system would have, the expression is given a different name: the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient , Q
c, is an
expression that is identical to the equilibrium constant expression, but
its value is calculated using concentrations that are not necessarily those at equilibrium.
The Relationship Between the Equilibrium Constant
and the Reaction Quotient
Recall the general reaction aP+bQ/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfcR+dS. The reaction quotient
expression for this reaction is
Q
c=[R]c[S]d
[P]a[Q]b
You can calculate a value for Qcby substituting the concentration of each
substance into this expression. If the value of Qcis equal to Kc, the system
must be at equilibrium. If Qcis greater than Kc, the numerator must be
very large. The concentrations of the chemicals on the right side of theequation must be more than their concentrations at equilibrium. In thissituation, the system attains equilibrium by moving to the left. Conversely,if Q
cis less than Kc, the system attains equilibrium by moving to the
right. Figure 7.8 summarizes these relationships between Qcand Kc.
This diagram shows how Qcand Kcdetermine reaction direction. When
Qc<Kc, the system attains equilibrium by moving to the right, favouring products. When
Qc=Kc, the system is at equilibrium. When Qc>Kc, the system attains equilibrium by moving
to the left, favouring reactants.

Ammonia can be removed from the equilibrium mixture by cooling
because ammonia lique ﬁes at a higher temperature than either nitrogen
or hydrogen. What happens to an equilibrium mixture if some ammonia is removed? To ﬁnd out, you need to calculate Q
c.
Qc=[NH 3]2
[N2][H2]3
If ammonia is removed from the equilibrium mixture, the numerator will
decrease, so Qcwill be smaller than Kc. When Qc<Kc, the system attains
equilibrium by moving to the right. Why? The system must respond to the removal of ammonia by forming more ammonia. Similarly, if nitrogen,hydrogen, or both were added, the system would re-establish equilibriumby shifting to the right. As long as the temperature remains constant, the re-established equilibrium will have the same K
cas the original
equilibrium.
A French chemist, Henri Le Ch âtelier, experimented with various
chemical equilibrium systems. (See Figure 7.9.) In 1888, Le Ch âtelier
summarized his work on changes to equilibrium systems in a generalstatement called Le Châtelier’s principle . It may be stated as follows:
A dynamic equilibrium tends to respond so as to relieve the effect of anychange in the conditions that affect the equilibrium .
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle predicts the way that an equilibrium system
responds to change. For example, when the concentration of a substancein a reaction mixture is changed, Le Ch âtelier ’s principle qualitatively
predicts what you can show quantitatively by evaluating the reaction quo-tient. If products are removed from an equilibrium system, more productsmust be formed to relieve the change. This is just as you would predict,because Q
cwill be less than Kc.
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle also predicts what will happen when other
changes are made to an equilibrium system. For example, you can use LeChâtelier ’s principle to predict the effects of changing the volume of a
cylinder that contains a mixture of gases, or the effects of changing thetemperature of an equilibrium system. In the next investigation, you willuse Le Ch âtelier ’s principle to predict the effects of making various
changes to different equilibrium systems. The Chemistry Bulletin that follows the investigation considers applications of Le Ch âtelier ’s principle
to areas outside of chemistry. Afterward, you will continue your studies ofLe Ch âtelier ’s principle and equilibrium systems in chemistry.

The sealed syringe contains a mixture of NO 2(g)and N2O4(g). The photograph on the left shows an equilibrium mixture at
atmospheric pressure. The middle photograph shows that the plunger has been pushed down, increasing the pressure. Twochanges cause the darker appearance of the gas mixture. First, the concentration of gases is greater. Second, decreasing the volume heats the gas. This causes a shift toward NO
2(g). The photograph on the right shows the result a few seconds after the
plunger was pushed down. The gas has cooled back to room temperature. The colour of the mixture is less brown, indicating a shift toward N
2O4(g).
Le Châtelier’s Principle:
Beyond Chemistry
How is Le Ch âtelier ’s principle related to predator-prey
interactions in ecosystems?
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle is a general statement
about how any system in equilibrium —not
just a chemical system —responds to change.
Le Ch âtelier principle concerns the conservation
of energy or matter. There are corresponding laws in several other areas of science.
Heinrich Lenz studied the direction of the
current that is induced in a conductor as a result of changing the magnetic ﬁeld near it. You can think
of this as the change in a system in electromagneticequilibrium. Lenz published his law in 1834. It statesthat when a conductor interacts with a magneticﬁeld, there must be an induced current that
opposes the interaction, because of the law of con-servation of energy. Lenz ’s law is used to explain
the direction of the induced current in generators,transformers, inductors, and many other systems.
In geology, John Pratt and George Airy
introduced the idea of isostacy in 1855. Earth ’s
crust is in gravitational equilibrium in almost all places. The crust responds to changes in theload on it, however, by slowly moving vertically.Examples of how the load on Earth ’s crust can
change include the weathering of mountain rangesand the melting of ice caps. Geologists estimatethat the ice over parts of Scandinavia and northern
Europe was well over 2 km thick during the last iceage. As a result of the ice melting and the removalof the weight pushing down on Earth ’s crust, the
central part of Scandinavia has risen over 500 m.This uplift is continuing. Here gravitational potential energy is being conserved.
In ecology, ecosystems are really examples
of steady state systems. Ecosystems involve a ﬂow of energy in only one direction, from the Sun.
Nevertheless, populations of plants and animalsdevelop stable numbers that react to externalchanges, such as disease and variations in theweather. For example, if the number of carnivoresin an ecosystem increases, more herbivores areeaten and the herbivore population decreases. The carnivores then have dif ﬁculty ﬁnding food.
Their populations decrease due to competition,
emigration, and starvation until a new balance,however delicate, is attained.
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle also applies to biology.
Homeostasis is the tendency of a body system to remain in a state of equilibrium. Examples ofhomeostasis include the maintenance of body temperature (homeothermy) and the pH balance of blood.
In economics, the law of supply and demand
is similar to Le Ch âtelier ’s principle. When the price
of a commodity, such as the price of a kilogram ofapples, is constant, the market for the commodityis at equilibrium. If the supply of the commodityfalls, the equilibrium is changed. The marketadjusts by increasing the price, which tends toincrease the supply.
Making Connections
1.Identify and describe two other examples,
in science or other ﬁelds, that illustrate
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle.
2.Draw diagrams to show the above examples
of Le Ch âtelier ’s principle in human physiology,
ecology, and economics. Show how differentconditions affect the equilibrium and how thesystems react to establish a new equilibrium.
362 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumChemistry Bulletin
Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 363The Effect of Ions on Aqueous Equilibrium Systems
Many important equilibrium systems involve ions in aqueous solution.
The common ion effect applies Le Ch âtelier ’s principle to ions in aqueous
solution. As its name suggests, the common ion effect involves adding an ion to a solution in which the ion is already present in solution. It isreally a concentration effect. The equilibrium shifts away from the addedion, as predicted by Le Ch âtelier ’s principle.
An aqueous solution that contains certain ions can be added to
another solution to form a precipitate, if the ions have low solubility. For example, adding silver nitrate solution to test for Cl
−(aq)is effective
due to the very low solubility of silver chloride. You can use the precipi-tation of an insoluble salt to remove almost all of a particular ion from a solution and, as a result, cause a shift in the position of equilibrium of the original solution. The common ion effect is important in the solubility of salts. The precipitation of insoluble salts is used to identifythe presence of unknown ions. You will learn more about the common ion effect in Chapter 9.
The Effect of Temperature Changes on the Position of Equilibrium
As you know, the value of the equilibrium constant changes with tempera-ture, because the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are affected. Le Ch âtelier ’s principle still holds, however. It can be used to predict the
effect of temperature changes on a system when the sign of the enthalpychange for the reaction is known. For example, the dissociation of sulfurtrioxide is endothermic.
2SO
3(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2SO 2(g)+O2(g) ∆H=197 kJ
As the reaction proceeds from left to right, energy is absorbed by the
chemical system and converted to chemical potential energy. If an equilibrium mixture of these gases is heated, energy is added to the system. Le Ch âtelier ’s principle predicts a shift that will relieve the
imposed change. Therefore, the shift will tend to remove the added energy. This will happen if the equilibrium shifts to the right, increasingthe amount of SO
2(g)and O2(g)formed. As a result, the value of Kcwill
increase. The shift in equilibrium is consistent (as it must be) with thelaw of conservation of energy.
Suppose that the equilibrium of an endothermic reaction shifted
to the left when the system was heated. From right to left, the reaction is exothermic. Thus, a shift to the left would release energy to the sur-roundings. This would make the mixture hotter. The equilibrium wouldshift still more to the left, releasing more and more energy. Clearly, thiscannot happen without violating the law of conservation of energy.
The effect of temperature on the position of equilibrium can be
summarized as follows:
•Endothermic change (∆H> 0): An increase in temperature shifts the
equilibrium to the right, forming more products. The value of K
c
increases. A decrease in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left,
forming more reactants. The value of Kcdecreases.
•Exothermic change (∆H< 0): An increase in temperature shifts the equi-
librium to the left, forming more reactants. The value of Kcdecreases.
A decrease in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right, formingmore products. The value of K
cincreases.Chickens have no sweat
glands. When the temperaturerises, they tend to breathefaster. This lowers the concen-tration of carbonate ions intheir blood. Because eggshellsare mostly calcium carbonate,faster-breathing chickens layeggs with thinner shells.Rather than installing expen-sive air conditioning, chickenfarmers can supply carbonatedwater for their chickens todrink when the temperaturereaches “fowl” highs. Howdoes this relate to Le Châtelier’s principle?FACTCHEM
364 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe Effects of Volume and Pressure Changes on Equilibrium
When the volume of a mixture of gases decreases, the pressure of the
gases must increase. Le Ch âtelier ’s principle predicts a shift in equili-
brium to relieve this change. Therefore, the shift must tend to reduce thepressure of the gases. Molecules striking the walls of a container cause gas pressure, so a reduction in gas pressure at constant temperature mustmean fewer gas molecules. Consider the following reaction again.
2SO
3(g)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2SO 2(g)+O2(g)
There are two gas molecules on the left side of the equation.
There are three gas molecules on the right side. Consequently,if the equilibrium shifts to the left, the pressure of the mix-ture will decrease. Reducing the volume of an equilibrium
mixture of gases, at constant temperature, causes a shift inequilibrium in the direction of fewer gas molecules . What if
there is the same number of gas molecules on both sides ofthe reaction equation? Changing the volume of the container,as shown in Figure 7.10, has no effect on the position of equilibrium. The value of K
cwill be unchanged, as long as
there is no change in temperature.
It is possible to increase the total pressure of gases in
a rigid container by injecting more gas. If the injected gasreacts with the other gases in the equilibrium mixture, the effect is the same as increasing the concentration of areactant. The equilibrium shifts to reduce the amount ofadded gas. If the injected gas does not react with the othergases (if an “inert ” gas is added), there is no effect on the
equilibrium. This is because the added gas is not part of the equilibrium system. Its addition causes no change in the volume of the container. Nitrogen (because of its lowreactivity) and the noble gases are often used as inert gases. If the container expands when an inert gas is added, theeffect is the same as increasing the volume and thereforedecreasing the pressure of the reacting gases.
The Effect of a Catalyst on Equilibrium
A catalyst speeds up the rateof a reaction, either by allowing a
different reaction mechanism or by providing additional mechanisms. The overall effect is to lower the activation energy, which increases therate of reaction. The activation energy is lowered the same amount for the forward and reverse reactions, however. There is the same increase in reaction rates for both reactions. As a result, a catalyst does not affectthe position of equilibrium. It only affects the time that is taken to achieveequilibrium.
Table 7.2 summarizes the effect of a catalyst, and other effects of
changing conditions, on a system at equilibrium. The Sample Problemthat follows provides an opportunity for you to use Le Ch âtelier ’s
principle to predict the equilibrium shift in response to various conditions.Concentration (mol/L)

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 367Applying Le Ch âtelier ’s Principle: Manufacturing Ammonia
Industrial processes must be run at optimal conditions to be economic.
This means more than simply manipulating the reaction conditions tomaximize the extent of the reaction. Business people, and the profession-als they hire to advise them, must consider other factors as well. Thesefactors include the rate of the reaction, safety, the location of the plant, thecost to build and operate the plant, the cost of acquiring reactant materi-als, the cost of transporting products, and the cost of hiring, educating,and maintaining plant workers.
The chapter introduction mentioned the importance of nitrogen to
plants and animals. Despite nitrogen ’s abundance in the atmosphere, its
low reactivity means that there is a limited supply in a form that organ-isms can use. In nature, bacteria and the energy of lightning supply thenitrates and other nitrogen compounds that plants need to survive.Humans use technology to produce these compounds for our extensiveagricultural industry.
In this chapter, you learned about the Haber process for manufactur-
ing ammonia. You used this process to help you understand various concepts related to equilibrium. As you can see in Figure 7.11, ammoniais a valuable industrial chemical. Its annual global production is well over100 million tonnes. The vast majority of ammonia, roughly 80%, is usedto make fertilizers. You will now examine how the equilibrium conceptsyou have been studying work together to provide society with a reliable,cost-effective supply of ammonia.
Before World War I, the main source of nitrates for human use was
from large deposits of bird droppings in Peru and sodium nitrate fromChile. These sources were becoming scarce and expensive. Then FritzHaber (1868 –1934), a lecturer in a technical college in Germany, began
to experiment with ways to manufacture ammonia. Haber knew thatammonia could be easily converted to nitrates and other useful nitrogen 32.In question 31, which changes affect the value of Kc? Which changes
do not affect the value of Kc?

The forward reaction is endothermic. State three different changes to

compounds. What he needed was a method for producing large quantities
of ammonia at minimal cost.
Haber experimented with the direct synthesis of ammonia.

Because the reaction is exothermic, heat is released as the reaction
proceeds. Le Ch âtelier ’s principle predicts that the yield of ammonia
is greater at lower temperatures. Just as in the contact process for manu-facturing sulfuric acid, however, high yield is not the only important factor. The rate of reaction for ammonia synthesis is too slow at low temperatures.
Le Ch âtelier ’s principle also predicts that the yield of ammonia is
greater at higher pressures. High-pressure plants are expensive to buildand maintain, however. In fact, the ﬁrst industrial plant that manufactured
ammonia had its reaction vessel blow up. A German chemical engineer,Carl Bosch, solved this problem by designing a double-walled steel vesselthat could operate at several hundred times atmospheric pressure. Modernplants operate at pressures in the range of 20 200 kPa to 30 400 kPa.
The gas mixture is kept pressurized in a condenser. (See Figure 7.12.)
Ammonia is removed from the reaction vessel by cooling the gas mixture.Because of the hydrogen bonding between ammonia molecules, the gascondenses into a liquid while the nitrogen and hydrogen remain as gases.Nitrogen is removed to shift the equilibrium toward the production ofmore ammonia. Once the ammonia is removed, the gases are recycledback to the reaction vessel in a continuous operation.Figure 7.11Ammonia (HN 3)

Chapter 7  Reversible Reactions and Chemical Equilibrium • MHR 369This diagram shows the stages in the Haber-Bosch process for manufacturing
ammonia. The catalyst is a mixture of MgO, Al2O3, and  SiO 2, with embedded iron crystals.
By manipulating the pressure and removing ammonia from the reaction
vessel, Haber successfully increased the yield of ammonia. To increase therate of the reaction, Haber needed to ﬁnd a catalyst. A catalyst would
allow the reaction to proceed at higher temperatures —a compromise
between rate and yield. Some historians claim that Haber performed morethan 6500 experiments trying to ﬁnd a suitable catalyst. He ﬁnally chose
an iron catalyst. This catalyst works well at the relatively moderate temperature of 400 ˚C that is used for the reaction. It lasts about ﬁve years
before losing its effectiveness.
Haber received the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1918. Bosch received
a Nobel prize in 1931 for his work on high pressure reactions. Today theHaber-Bosch process is used to manufacture virtually all the ammoniathat is produced in the world. Plants are usually located near a source ofnatural gas, which is used to obtain the hydrogen gas.

Section Summary
In this section, you learned that the expression for the reaction quotient is the same as the expression for the equilibrium constant. The concentra-tions that are used to solve these expressions may be different, however.When Q
cis less than Kc, the reaction proceeds to form more products.
When Qcis greater than Kc, the reaction proceeds to form more reactants.
These changes continue until Qcis equal to Kc. Le Ch âtelier ’s principle
describes this tendency of a chemical system to return to equilibrium aftera change moves it from equilibrium. The industrial process for manufac-turing ammonia illustrates how chemical engineers apply Le Ch âtelier ’s
principle to provide the most economical yield of a valuable chemicalproduct.

Anesthesiology:
A Career in Pain Management
Laila Ra ﬁk Karwa
Dr. Laila Ra ﬁk Karwa is a specialist in pain. She
prevents it, manages it, and alleviates it. She is an anesthesiologist.
Anesthesiologists are medical doctors who are
responsible for inducing sleep before surgery, andfor managing patients ’ pain before, during, and after
surgery. Anesthesiologists are also involved in managing pain in patients who have severe illnesses, or acute or chronic pain. For example,Karwa ’s areas of interest include pediatric and
obstetric anesthesia and acute pain management.
Anesthesiologists must have an intimate
knowledge of the chemical and physical propertiesof gases. Many anesthetics are inhaled and aredelivered to the bloodstream by diffusion. Thespeed at which diffusion occurs between the lungs,the blood, and other tissues of the body depends on a constant called the partition coefﬁcient . This
constant is a ratio that describes the equilibriumconcentrations of a solute that is dissolved in twoseparate phases. The solute becomes separated(partitioned) between the two solvents in such a waythat its concentration in one is directly proportionalto its concentration in the other.
Gases diffuse from areas of high concentration
to areas of low concentration. The speed at whichdiffusion occurs in the body depends on partitioncoefﬁcients. The faster the concentration in the lung
and brain tissues reaches the inhaled concentrationof an anesthetic, the sooner a patient is induced.Dr. Karwa enjoys the immediate grati ﬁcation
that comes with anesthesiology and the speed atwhich the anesthetics exact their effects. “What I like
most about my job is the ability to let patients havetheir surgery being completely unaware of it, and tomake them as pain-free as possible during and aftersurgery, ” she says. She chose medicine as a career
because she was interested in biology and becauseshe wanted to help other people with their healthproblems, after witnessing her father ’s struggles
with rheumatic heart disease.
Dr. Karwa completed high school in Bombay,
India, and later studied medicine at the University of Bombay. After medical school, she immigrated to Canada. She completed residency training inanesthesia at the University of Toronto and nowworks at St. Joseph ’s Health Science Centre as a
staff anesthesiologist.
In Canada, students who are interested in a
career as an anesthesiologist must complete two tothree years of university before applying to medicalschool. Many medical schools in Canada requireapplicants to have taken courses in speci ﬁc subjects
in the biological and physical sciences, and to have some background in the humanities or socialsciences. This education also helps students preparefor the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT),which is required for application to most medicalschools. The MCAT tests an applicant ’s aptitude for
science, verbal reasoning, and writing. Most medicalschool programs in Canada are four years long.
Medical school graduates who decide to do
specialty training in anesthesiology must complete a postgraduate residency program, which usuallytakes at least ﬁve years.
Making Career Connections
1.Although anesthesiologists tend to be associated
with surgery, they also work outside the con ﬁnes
of the operating room. Research other locationswhere you might ﬁnd an anesthesiologist.
2.Anesthetics are powerful medications. What risks
to patients ’ health do anesthesiologists have to
consider when they administer anesthetics?
3.Anesthetics are classi ﬁed into three main groups:
general, regional, and local. Research the criteriafor this classi ﬁcation, and explain the distinctions.

For many people, the word “acid” evokes the image of a fuming, highly
corrosive, dangerous liquid. This image is fairly accurate for concentratedhydrochloric acid, a strong acid. Most acids, however, are not as corrosiveas hydrochloric acid, although they may still be very hazardous. Forexample, hydroﬂuoric acid can cause deep, slow-healing tissue burns if it is handled carelessly. It is used by artists and artisans who etch glass. Itreacts with the silica in glass to form a compound that dissolves, leavingthe glass with a brilliant surface. Hydroﬂuoric acid is highly corrosive.Even a 1% solution is considered to be hazardous. Yet chemists classifyhydroﬂuoric acid as a weak acid.
You learned about acids and bases in your previous chemistry course.
In this chapter, you will extend your knowledge to learn how the struc-ture of a compound determines whether it is an acid or a base. You willuse the equilibrium constant of the reaction of an acid or base with waterto determine whether the acid or base is strong or weak.

378 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases
According to the Arrhenius theory (1887), acids and bases are de ﬁned
in terms of their structure and the ions produced when they dissolve in water.
•An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form H
+(aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius acids are hydrochloric acid, HCl, and sulfuricacid, H
2SO4.
•A base is a substance that dissociates in water to form OH−(aq). Two
examples of Arrhenius bases are sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH.You will perform three acid-base reactions. Before
you begin, read the Procedure and make a predic-tion about the relative rates of these reactions.
Safety Precautions
The solutions that are used in this lab are irritantsand should be handled with care. Wash any spills on your skin or clothing with plenty of water. Informyour teacher immediately.

The following ExpressLab highlights concepts that you will examine in
this section, as well as later in the chapter.
Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 379The Arrhenius theory explains acid-base reactions as a combination of
H+(aq)and OH−(aq). It provides insight into the heat of neutralization for
the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base. (Strong acids andbases dissociate completely into ions in solution.) For example, considerthe following reaction.
HCl
(aq)+NaOH (aq)→NaCl (aq)+H2O(/lscript)∆H=−56 kJ
The total ionic equation for this reaction is
H+(aq)+Cl−(aq)+Na+(aq)+OH−(aq)→Na+(aq)+Cl−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)∆H=−56 kJ
Subtracting spectator ions from both sides, the net ionic equation is
H+(aq)+OH−(aq)→H2O(/lscript)∆H=−56 kJ
Different combinations of strong Arrhenius acids and bases react with the
same exothermic result. Measurements always show the release of 56 kJ ofenergy per mole of water formed. This makes sense, because the net ionicequation is the same regardless of the speci ﬁc neutralization reaction that
occurs.
The Arrhenius theory has limitations, however. For example, H
+(aq),
a bare proton, does not exist in water. The positive charge on a proton isattracted to the region of negative charge on the lone pair of electrons on a water molecule ’s oxygen atom. The combination is a hydrated proton
called a hydronium ion , H
3O+(aq).
H+(aq)+H2O(/lscript)→H3O+(aq)
The hydronium ion, itself, forms hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules. (See Figure 8.1.) Thus, a better formula for the ion that is present in acidic solutions is [H(H
2O)n]+, where nis usually 4 or 5. For
convenience, however, chemists usually use a single hydronium ion when writing equations.
The Arrhenius theory also has limitations for explaining certain reactions.
For example, aqueous solutions of ammonia are basic. They react withacids in neutralization reactions, even though ammonia does not containthe hydroxide ion. Many aqueous solutions of salts with no hydroxideions are basic, too. Some reactions take place without any liquid solvent.For example, ammonium chloride can be formed by the reaction betweenammonia and hydrogen chloride, which are both gases:
NH
3(g)+HCl (g)→NH 4Cl(s)
H3O+hydrogen bond+
In aqueous solution,
the hydronium ion, H3O+, forms
hydrogen bonds with other watermolecules.Figure 8.1
380 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumThe Brønsted-Lowry Theory
The limitations of the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases are overcome
by a more general theory, called the Br ønsted-Lowry theory. This theory
was proposed independently, in 1923, by Johannes Br ønsted, a Danish
chemist, and Thomas Lowry, an English chemist. It recognizes an acid-base reaction as a chemical equilibrium, having both a forward reaction and a reverse reaction that involve the transfer of a proton. TheBrønsted-Lowry theory de ﬁnes acids and bases as follows:
•An acid is a substance from which a proton can be removed. (Some
chemists describe Br ønsted-Lowry acids as “proton-donors. ”)
•A base is a substance that can accept a proton. (Some chemists describe
Brønsted-Lowry bases as “proton-acceptors. ”)
Note that the word “proton ” refers to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom —an
H
+ion that has been removed from the acid molecule. It does not refer
to a proton removed from the nucleus of another atom, such as oxygen orsulfur, that may be present in the acid molecule. As mentioned previously,
H
+ions share electrons with any species (ion or molecule) that has a lone
pair of electrons. In aqueous solution, the proton bonds with a water molecule to form the hydronium ion. Unlike the Arrhenius theory, however, the Br ønsted-Lowry theory is not restricted to aqueous solutions.
For example, the lone pair of electrons on an ammonia molecule can bondwith H
+, and liquid ammonia can act as a base.
Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
The dissociation of acetic acid in water is represented in Figure 8.2.
This dissociation is an equilibrium reaction because it proceeds in bothdirections. Acetic acid is weak, so only a few ions dissociate. The positionof equilibrium lies to the left, and the reverse reaction is favoured. In the reverse reaction, the hydronium ion gives up a proton to the acetateion. Thus, these ions are an acid and a base, respectively, as shown inFigure 8.3. The acid on the left ( CH
3COOH ) and the base on the right
(CH 3COO−)differ by one proton. They are called a conjugate acid-base
pair. Similarly, H2Oand H3O+are a conjugate acid-base pair.

Unlike the Arrhenius theory, the Br ønsted-Lowry theory of acids and
bases can explain the basic properties of ammonia when it dissolves inwater. See Figure 8.4.
The dissociation of ammonia, a weak base, in water
Aqueous ammonia is a weak base, so relatively few hydroxide ions form.The position of equilibrium lies to the left. In the forward reaction, thewater molecule gives up a proton and acts as an acid. A substance thatcan act as a proton donor (an acid) in one reaction and a proton acceptor(a base) in another reaction is said to be amphoteric . (Water acts as an
acid in the presence of a stronger base, and as a base in the presence of astronger acid. Figure 8.4base acid conjugate acid

Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 383Molecular Structure and the Strength of Acids and Bases
When a strong acid or base dissolves in water, almost every acid or base
molecule dissociates. While there are many acids and bases, most areweak. Thus, the number of strong acids and strong bases is fairly small.
The binary acids of non-metals exhibit periodic trends in their acid
strength, as shown in Figure 8.5. Two factors are responsible for thistrend: the electronegativity of the atom that is bonded to hydrogen, and the strength of the bond.
Across a period, electronegativity is the most important factor. The acid
strength of hydrides increases as their electronegativity increases. Thishappens because an electronegative atom draws electrons away from thehydrogen atom, making it relatively positive. The negative pole of a watermolecule then strongly attracts the hydrogen atom and pulls it away.
Down a group, bond strength is the most important factor. Acid
strength increases as bond strength decreases. A weaker bond means thatthe hydrogen atom is more easily pulled away from the atom to which itis attached. For example, hydro ﬂuoric acid is a stronger acid than water,
but HF is the weakest of the hydrohalic acids because the H-F bond is relatively strong.CH4NH 3H2O

Br, and I (but not F): for example, hydrochloric acid, HCl, andhydrobromic acid, HBr (HCl and HBr are hydrohalic acids : acids
that have hydrogen bonded to atoms of the halogen elements.)
•oxoacids (acids containing oxygen atoms) in which the number of
oxygen atoms exceeds, by two or more, the number of protons thatcan be dissociated: for example, nitric acid, HNO
3, sulfuric acid,
H2SO4, perchloric acid, HClO 4, and chloric acid, HClO 3
The binary acids
show periodic trends, which arerelated to electronegativity andbond strength.Figure 8.5
384 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumOxoacids increase in strength with increasing numbers of oxygen
atoms, as shown in Figure 8.6. The hydrogen atoms that dissociate in water are always attached to oxygen atoms. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so oxygen atoms draw electrons away fromhydrogen atoms. The more oxygen atoms there are in a molecule, thegreater is the polarity of the bond between each hydrogen atom and theoxygen atom it is attached to, and the more easily the water molecule cantear the hydrogen atom away.
The relative strength of oxoacids increases with the number of oxygen atoms.
Acids such as HCl, CH3COOH , and HF are monoprotic acids . They have
only a single hydrogen atom that dissociates in water. Some acids havemore than one hydrogen atom that dissociates. These acids are calledpolyprotic acids . For example, sulfuric acid has two hydrogen atoms that
can dissociate.

Sulfuric acid is a far stronger acid than the hydrogen sulfate ion, because
much more energy is required to remove a proton from a negativelycharged ion. The strength of a polyprotic acid decreases as the number of
hydrogen atoms that have dissociated increases .
Strong bases are con ﬁned to the oxides and hydroxides from Groups 1
(IA) and 2 (IIA).
The strong basic oxides have metal atoms with low electronegativity.
Thus, the bond to oxygen is ionic and is relatively easily broken by theattraction of polar water molecules. The oxide ion always reacts withwater molecules to produce hydroxide ions.

During an experiment, a student pours 25.0 mL of 1.40 mol/L nitric
acid into a beaker that contains 15.0 mL of 2.00 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution. Is the resulting solution acidic or basic? What is theconcentration of the ion that causes the solution to be acidic or basic?
What Is Required?
You must determine the ion in excess and its concentration.

Volume of sodium hydroxide =15.0 mL

Step 1 Write the chemical equation for the reaction.
Step 2 Calculate the amount of each reactant using the following equation.
Amount (in mol) =Concentration (in mol/L) ×Volume (in L)
Step 3 Determine the limiting reactant.
Step 4 The reactant in excess is a strong acid or base. Thus, the excessamount results in the same amount of H
3O+or OH−.
Step 5 Calculate the concentration of the excess ion by using the amount
in excess and the total volume of the solution.
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 HNO 3(aq) +NaOH (aq)→NaNO 3(aq) +H2O(/lscript)
Step 2 Amount of HNO 3=1.40 mol/L ×0.0250 L
=0.0350 mol
Amount of NaOH =2.00 mol/L ×0.0150 L
=0.0300 mol
Step 3 The reactants combine in a 1:1 ratio. The amount of NaOH is less,
so this reactant must be the limiting reactant.
Step 4 Amount of excess HNO 3(aq) =0.0350 mol −0.0300 mol
=0.005 0 mol
Therefore, the amount of H3O+(aq)is 5.0×10−3mol.

Section Summary
Strong acids and bases (and strong electrolytes) dissociate completely in
water. Therefore, you can use the concentrations of these compounds todetermine the concentrations of the ions they form in aqueous solutions.You cannot, however, use the concentrations of weak acids, bases, andelectrolytes in the same way. Their solutions contain some particles that have not dissociated into ions. Nevertheless, important changes in
[H

of water.

Specific Expectations  The Equilibrium of
Weak Acids and Bases
The dissociation of an acidic or basic compound in aqueous solution
produces ions that interact with water. The pH of the aqueous solution isdetermined by the position of equilibrium in reactions between the ionsthat are present in solution and the water molecules. Pure water contains a few ions, produced by the dissociation of water molecules:
2H
2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfH3O+(aq)+OH−(aq)
At 25 ˚C, only about two water molecules in one billion dissociate. This
is why pure water is such a poor conductor of electricity. In neutral water, at 25 ˚C, the concentration of hydronium ions is the same as the
concentration of hydroxide ions: 1.0×10
−7mol/L. These concentrations
must be the same because the dissociation of water produces equal num-bers of hydronium and hydroxide ions. Because this is an equilibriumreaction, and because the position of equilibrium of all reactions changeswith temperature, [H
3O+]is not 1.0×10−7mol/L at other temperatures.
The same is true of [OH−].
The Ion Product Constant for Water
The equilibrium constant, Kc, for the dissociation of water is given by the
following expression.
Kc=[H3O+][OH−]
[H2O]2
So few ions form that the concentration of water is essentially constant.
The product Kc[H2O]2is equal to the product of the concentrations of
hydronium ions and hydroxide ions. The equilibrium value of the concentration ion product [H
3O+][OH−]at 25 ˚C is called the ion product
constant for water . It is given the symbol Kw.
Kc[H2O]2=[H3O+][OH−]
=1.0×10−7mol/L ×1.0×10−7mol/L
=1.0×10−14
=Kw
The units are commonly dropped, as in other equilibrium expressions you
have encountered.
The concentration of H3O+in the solution of a strong acid is equal
to the concentration of the dissolved acid, unless the solution is verydilute. Consider [ H
3O+] in a solution of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid.
All the molecules of HCl dissociate in water, forming a hydronium ionconcentration that equals 0.1 mol/L. The increased [ H
3O+] pushes the
dissociation reaction between water molecules to the left, in accordancewith Le Ch âtelier ’s principle. Consequently, the concentration of hydro-
nium ions that results from the dissociation of water is even less than
1×10
−7mol/L. This [ H3O+] is negligible compared with the 0.1 mol/L
concentration of the hydrochloric acid. Unless the solution is very dilute(about 1×10
−7mol/L), the dissociation of water molecules can be ignored
when determining [ H3O+] of a strong acid.
Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 389Similarly, the concentration of hydroxide ions can be determined from
the concentration of the dissolved base. If the solution is a strong base,you can ignore the dissociation of water molecules when determining[OH
−], unless the solution is very dilute. When either [ H3O+] or [ OH−] is
known, you can use the ion product constant for water, Kw, to determine
the concentration of the other ion. Although the value of Kwfor water is
1.0×10−14at 25 ˚C only, you can use this value unless another value is
given for a different temperature.
[H3O+] and [OH−] in Aqueous Solutions at 25˚C
In an acidic solution, [ H3O+] is greater than 1.0×10−7mol/L and
[OH−] is less than 1.0×10−7mol/L.
In a neutral solution, both [ H3O+] and [ OH−] are equal to
1.0×10−7mol/L.
In a basic solution, [ H3O+] is less than 1.0×10−7mol/L and [ OH−]
is greater than 1.0×10−7mol/L.
Problem
Find [H3O+]and [OH−]in each solution.
(a)2.5 mol/L nitric acid
(b)0.16 mol/L barium hydroxide
Solution
You know that nitric acid is a strong acid and barium hydroxide is a
strong base. Since both dissociate completely in aqueous solutions, you can use their molar concentrations to determine [ H
3O+] or [ OH−].
You can ﬁnd the concentration of the other ion using Kw:
Kw=1.0×10−14
=[H3O+][OH−]
(a)[HNO 3]=2.5 mol/L, so [H 3O+]=2.5 mol/L
[OH−]=1.0×10−14mol/L
2.5
=4.0×10−15mol/L
(b)Ba(OH) 2 Ba2+(aq)+2OH−(aq)
Each mole of Ba(OH) 2in solution forms two moles of OH−ions.
∴[OH−]=2×0.16 =0.32 mol/L
[H3O+]=1.0×10−14mol/L
0.32
=3.1×10−14mol/L
Check Your Solution
For a solution of a strong acid, as in part (a), [H3O+]should be greater
than 1.0×10−14and [OH−]should be less than 1.0×10−14. For a solution

You can describe the acidity of an aqueous solution quantitatively by
stating the concentration of the hydronium ions that are present. [ H3O+]
is often, however, a very small number. The pH scale was devised by aDanish biochemist named S øren S ørensen as a convenient way to repre-
sent acidity (and, by extension, basicity). The scale is logarithmic, basedon 10. Think of the letter pas a mathematical operation representing –log.
The pHof a solution is the exponential power of hydrogen (or hydroni-
um) ions, in moles per litre. It can therefore be expressed as follows:
pH=−log[H
3O+]
The practical range of the pH scale, shown in Figure 8.7, is from 0 to 14.
A solution of a strong acid that is more concentrated than 1.0 mol/Lwould give a negative pH. Since you can determine [
H3O+] of such
solutions directly from the concentration of the acid, the pH scale offersno advantage. Similarly, the pH of a strong base that is more concentratedthan 1.0 mol/L is greater than 14. Note that pH is a dimensionless quantity. In other words, it has no units.
You can calculate the pOH (the power of hydroxide ions) of a solution
from the [ OH
−].
pOH =−log[OH−]

Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 393The Acid Dissociation Constant
Many common foods (such as citrus fruits), pharmaceuticals (such as
Aspirin ™), and some vitamins (such as niacin, vitamin B3) are weak
acids. When a weak acid dissolves in water, it does not completely disso-ciate. The concentration of the hydronium ions, and the concentration ofthe conjugate base of the acid that is formed in solution, depend on theinitial concentration of the acid and the amount of acid that dissociates.
You can represent any weak monoprotic acid with the general formula
HA. The equilibrium of a weak monoprotic acid in aqueous solution canbe expressed as follows:
HA
(aq)+H2O(aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfH3O+(aq)+A−(aq)
The equilibrium expression for this reaction is
Kc=[H3O+][A−]
[HA][H 2O]
In dilute solutions, the concentration of water is almost constant.
Multiplying both sides of the equilibrium expression by [ H2O] gives
the product of two constants on the left side. This new constant is calledthe acid dissociation constant , K
a. (Some chemists refer to the acid
dissociation constant as the acid ionization constant . With either name,
the symbol is Ka.)
Kc[H2O]=Ka=[H3O+][A−]
[HA]
You can determine the value of Kafor a particular acid by measuring the
pH of a solution. In the following investigation, you will add sodiumhydroxide to acetic acid, which is a weak acid. (See Figure 8.8.) By graph-ing pH against the volume of sodium hydroxide that you added, you willbe able to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid. Then you will beable to determine the acid dissociation constant, K
a, for this acid.

•Write the chemical equation. Use the chemical equation to set up an
ICE table for the reacting substances. Enter any values that are givenin the problem. ( Note: For the problems in this textbook, you can
assume that the concentrations of hydronium ions and hydroxideions in pure water are negligible compared with the concentrationsof these ions when a weak acid or weak base is dissolved in water.)
•Let xrepresent the change in concentration of the substance with
the smallest coef ﬁcient in the chemical equation.
•For problems that give the initial concentration of the acid, [HA],
compare the initial concentration of the acid with the acid dissociation constant, K
a.
•If [HA]
Ka>500, the change in the initial concentration, x, is
negligible and can be ignored.
•If [HA]
Ka<500, the change in the initial concentration, x, may
not be negligible. The equilibrium equation will be more complex,
possibly requiring the solution of a quadratic equation.
Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 397Percent Dissociation
The percent dissociation of a weak acid is the fraction of acid molecules
that dissociate compared with the initial concentration of the acid,expressed as a percent. (Some chemists refer to percent dissociation aspercent of dissociation .) The percent dissociation depends on the value
of K
afor the acid, as well as the initial concentration of the weak acid.

402 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumPolyprotic Acids and [H 3O+]
All polyprotic acids, except sulfuric acid, are weak. Their second
dissociation is much weaker than their ﬁrst dissociation. For this reason,
when calculating [ H3O+] and pH of a polyprotic acid, only the ﬁrst
dissociation needs to be considered. The calculation is then the same asthe calculation for any weak monoprotic acid. In the Sample Problem,[HPO
42−] was found to be the same as the second dissociation constant,
Ka2. The concentration of the anions formed in the second dissociation
of a polyprotic acid is equal to Ka2.
The only common strong polyprotic acid is sulfuric acid.
Nevertheless, it is strong only for the ﬁrst dissociation. Like the second
dissociation of other polyprotic acids, the second dissociation of sulfuricacid is weak.

[H3O+] results from the ﬁrst dissociation of phosphoric acid, so the
second dissociation has a negligible effect on the concentration of hydronium ions or the pH of the solution. You would expect this,because the second dissociation is much weaker than the ﬁrst.

Thus, for an acid and its conjugate base (or a base and its conjugate acid),
KaKb=Kw. One interpretation of the result is the stronger an acid, the
weaker its conjugate base must be. This makes sense chemically, becausea strong acid gives up a proton from each molecule. Therefore, its conju-gate base does not bond with the proton. In summary, then, the strength of an acid and its conjugate base are inversely related. The conjugate of a
strong acid is always a weak base, and, conversely, the conjugate of astrong base is always a weak acid .29.An aqueous solution of household ammonia has a molar

A solution that contains a weak acid/conjugate base mixture or a weak

resists changes in pH when a moderate amount of an acid or a base isadded to it. (See Figure 8.9.) For example, adding 10 mL of 1.0 mol/Lhydrochloric acid to 1 L of water changes the pH from 7 to about 3, a difference of 4 units.

410 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumAdding a moderate amount of an acid or a base to a buffer solution causes little
change in pH.
Buffer solutions can be made in two different ways:
1.by using a weak acid and one of its salts: for example, by mixing
acetic acid and sodium acetate
2.by using a weak base and one of its salts: for example, by mixing ammonia and ammonium chloride
How does a buffer solution resist changes in pH when an acid or a base
is added? Consider a buffer solution that is made using acetic acid andsodium acetate. Acetic acid is weak, so most of its molecules are not dissociated and [ CH
3COOH ] is high. Sodium acetate is soluble and a
good electrolyte, so [ CH3COO−] is also high. Adding an acid or a base has
little effect because the added H3O+or OH−ions are removed by one of
the components in the buffer solution. The equilibrium of the reactionsbetween the ions in solution shifts, as predicted by Le Ch âtelier ’s
principle and described below.
•Adding an acid to a buffer: Acetate ions react with the hydronium
ions added to the solution.
CH
3COO−(aq)+H3O+(aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfCH3COOH (aq)+H2O(/lscript)
The position of equilibrium shifts to the right. Here hydronium ions
are removed, by acetate ions, from the sodium acetate component.
•Adding a base to a buffer: Hydroxide ions react with the hydronium
ions that are formed by the dissociation of acetic acid.
H3O+(aq)+OH−(aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2H2O(/lscript)
The position of this water equilibrium shifts to the right, replacing
hydronium ions.
Buffer solutions have two important characteristics. One of these
characteristics is the pH of the solution. The other is its buffer capacity :
the amount of acid or base that can be added before considerable changeoccurs to the pH. The buffer capacity depends on the concentration of the acid/conjugate base (or the base/conjugate acid) in the buffer solution.When the ratio of the concentration of the buffer components is close to 1,the buffer capacity has reached its maximum. As well, a buffer that ismore concentrated resists changes to pH more than than a buffer that ismore dilute. This idea is illustrated in Figure 8.10, with buffer solutionsof acetic acid and acetate of different concentrations.Figure 8.9

Chapter 8  Acids, Bases, and pH • MHR 411Buffers in the Blood
Buffers are extremely important in biological systems. The pH of arterial
blood is about 7.4. The pH of the blood in your veins is just slightly less. If the pH of blood drops to 7.0, or rises above 7.5, life-threateningproblems develop. To maintain its pH within a narrow range, blood contains a number of buffer systems.

Titrations are common analytical procedures that chemists perform,
with the usual goal of determining the concentration of one of the reactants. The equivalence point is the point in a titration when the acid
and base that are present completely react with each other. If chemistsknow the volumes of both solutions at the equivalence point, and the con-centration of one of them, they can calculate the unknown concentration.
As you can see in Figure 8.11, the equivalence point is the middle of
the steep rise that occurs in a titration curve. The endpoint of a titrationoccurs when the indicator changes colour, which happens over a range of about 2 pH units. The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point.Therefore, the change in colour usually takes place in a fraction of a millilitre, with the addition of a single drop of solution. Chemists haveaccess to a variety of indicators that change colour at different pH values.The colour changes and ranges for three common indicators are given in Table 8.4.
Table 8.4 Data on the Endpoints of Three Common Acid-Base Indicators
When an indicator is used in a titration, the range of pH values at which
its endpoint occurs must include, or be close to, the equivalence point.Some representative acid-base titration curves, shown in Figures 8.11,8.12, and 8.13, will illustrate this point.

Strong Acid With a Strong Base
These titrations have a pH of 7 at equivlence.
Indicators such as phenolphthalein, methyl red,and bromocresol green can be used, becausetheir endpoints are close to the equivalencepoint. Many chemists prefer phenolphthaleinbecause the change from colourless to pink iseasy to see.Indicator Colour change at endpoint Approximate range

These titrations have pH values that are greater than 7 at equivalence. In the
titration shown in Figure 8.12, the equivalence point occurs at a pH of 8.80.Therefore, phenolphthalein is a good indicator for this titration. Methyl redis not, because its endpoint is too far from the equivalence point.
Titration Curve for a Weak Base With a Strong Acid
These titrations have pH values that are less than 7 at the equivalencepoint. The equivalence point in the titration shown in Figure 8.13, involving ammonia and hydrochloric acid, occurs at a pH of 5.27. Eithermethyl red or bromocresol green could be used as an indicator, but notphenolphthalein.
Section Summary
In this section, you examined acid-base titration curves for combinationsof strong and weak acids and bases. You may have noticed the absence of a curve for the reaction of a weak acid with a weak base. A weak acid-weak base titration curve is dif ﬁcult to describe quantitatively,
because it has competing equilibria. You may learn about this curve infuture chemistry courses.

involving aqueous ions. You will learn how to calculate the pH at anequivalence point, so you can select an appropriate indicator for any acid-base titration. You will also learn why equilibrium is important tothe solubility of compounds that are slightly soluble, and how to predictwhether a precipitate will form as the result of a reaction between ions in solution.
In this section, you examined acid-base titration curves.
(a)Distinguish between the equivalence point and the endpoint for
a titration.
(b)When choosing an indicator, do the pH values of the two pointsneed to coincide exactly? Explain.
In a titration, a basic solution is added to an acidic solution, and
measurements of pH are taken. Compare a strong acid-strong base titration and a strong acid-weak base titration in terms of
(a)the initial pH
(b)the quantity of base that is needed to reach the equivalence point
(c)the pH at the equivalence point
Assume that the concentrations of the two solutions are identical.

The kidneys are sometimes called the master chemists of the body. They
work to maintain the constant composition of the blood by helping to bal-ance water and the various ions that are present in the blood. A veryimportant equilibrium in the blood, which the kidneys help to control,involves calcium ions and phosphate ions.
3Ca
2+(aq)+2PO 43−(aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfCa3(PO 4)2(s)
This equilibrium sometimes causes problems, however. For example,
calcium phosphate helps to give bones their rigidity. If the kidneys removetoo many phosphate ions from the blood due to disease, the position ofequilibrium shifts to the left, as predicted by Le Châtelier’s principle. Morecalcium phosphate dissolves in the blood, reducing bone density. The lossof too much calcium phosphate can lead to osteoporosis.
If the kidneys remove too many calcium ions from the blood, the
equilibrium position in the kidneys shifts to the right. Solid calcium
phosphate can form in the kidneys, producing kidney stones. Kidneystones, which are painful, can also form as the result of calcium oxalateprecipitating in the kidneys. Precipitates of other compounds can affectdifferent areas of the body: gallstones in the gall bladder and gout in the joints are two examples.
In this chapter, you will continue your study of acid-base reactions.
You will ﬁnd out how ions in aqueous solution can act as acids or bases.Then, by applying equilibrium concepts to ions in solution, you will beable to predict the solubility of ionic compounds in water and the forma-tion of a precipitate.

Salt Solutions
At the end of Chapter 8, you learned that when just enough acid and
base have been mixed for a complete reaction, the solution can be acidic, neutral, or basic. The reaction between an acid and a base forms an aqueous solution of a salt. The properties of the dissolved salt determinethe pH of a titration solution at equivalence. Figure 9.1 shows the acidic,basic, or neutral properties of three salt solutions.
In this section, you will learn how to predict the pH of an aqueous
solution of a salt. Predicting the pH is useful when you are performing atitration experiment, because you need to choose an indicator thatchanges colour at a pH value that is close to the pH at equivalence.
Acidic and Basic Properties of Salts
The acidic or basic property of an aqueous solution of a salt results fromreactions between water and the dissociated ions of the salt. Some ions donot react with water. They are neutral in solution. Ions that do react withwater produce a solution with an excess of H
3O+(aq)or OH−(aq). The extent
of the reaction determines the pH of the solution. As you will see, thereaction between an ion and water is really just another acid-base reaction.
Is there a way to classify salts so that you can predict whether their
solutions in water will be basic, acidic, or neutral? In the followingExpressLab, you will determine the pH values of solutions of varioussalts. Then you will analyze your results to decide if there is a pattern.

In the following equation, HA (aq)represents a strong acid, which
dissociates completely in water.
HA (aq)+H2O(/lscript)→H3O+(aq)+A−(aq)
Interpreting the equation from right to left, the conjugate base of the
acid, A−, has no tendency to combine with hydronium ions in water.
Therefore, it is a weak base. In fact, the anion that is formed by a strongacid is a much weaker base than water, so it does not react with water.Consequently, when a salt that contains the anion of a strong acid is dissolved in water, the anion has no effect on the pH of the solution. In this ExpressLab, you will measure the pH
values of solutions of different salts with the sameconcentration in mol/L. The pH of a solution givesthe relative [ H
3O+], compared with the [ OH−]. From
this information, you can infer which ion in the saltreacted with water to the greatest extent.

goggles at all times.

Similarly, the cations that form strong bases (the alkali metals and
the metals below beryllium in Group 2 (IIA)) do not tend to react withhydroxide ions. These cations are weaker acids than water. Therefore,when a salt contains one of these ions (for example, Na
+) the cation has
no effect on the pH of an aqueous solution.
If a salt contains the cation of a strong base and the anion of a strong
acid, neither ion reacts with water. Therefore, the solution has a pH of 7. Sodium chloride is an example of such a salt. It is formed by thereaction of sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and hydrochloric acid (a strong acid). Salts of strong bases and strong acids dissolve in water
and form neutral solutions .
Salts That Dissolve and Form Acidic Solutions
A weak base, such as aqueous ammonia, dissociates very little. Therefore,
the equilibrium lies to the left.
NH
3(aq) +H2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfNH 4+(aq)+OH−
Interpreting this equation from right to left, the ammonium ion,
(which is the conjugate acid of aqueous ammonia) is a relatively strongacid, compared to water. In solution, ammonium ions react with water,resulting in an acidic solution:
NH
4+(aq)+H2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfNH 3(aq) +H3O+(aq)
If a salt consists of the cation of a weak base and the anion of a strong
acid, only the cation reacts with water. The solution has a pH that is lessthan 7. Salts of weak bases and strong acids dissolve in water and form
acidic solutions .
Salts That Dissolve and Form Basic Solutions
A weak acid, HA, forms a conjugate base, A
−, that is relatively strong.
The reaction of such an anion with water results in a solution that is basic.For example, consider acetic acid, CH
3COOH (aq), a weak acid. The conju-
gate base of acetic acid, CH3COO−(aq), is relatively strong, compared to
water. It reacts with water to form a basic solution.
CH3COO−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfCH3COOH (aq)+OH−(aq)
If a salt consists of the cation of a strong base and the anion of a weak
acid, such as NaCH 3COO , only the anion reacts signi ﬁcantly with water.
The reaction produces hydroxide ions. Therefore, the solution will have apH that is greater than 7. Salts of strong bases and weak acids dissolve in
water and form basic solutions.
Salts of Weak Bases and Weak Acids
If a salt consists of the cation of a weak base and the anion of a weak acid,
both ions react with water. The solution is weakly acidic or weakly basic,depending on the relative strength of the ions that act as the acid or the base. You can determine which ion is stronger by comparing thevalues of K
aand Kbassociated with the cation and the anion, respectively.
If Ka>Kb,the solution is acidic. If Kb>Ka,the solution is basic .A reaction between an ion
and water is sometimes calleda hydrolysis reaction. An
ammonium ion hydrolyzes, buta sodium ion does not. Anacetate ion hydrolyzes, but achloride ion does not.FACTCHEM

Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria • MHR 425Calculating pH at Equivalence
In an acid-base titration, you carefully measure the volumes of acid and
base that react. Then, knowing the concentration of either the acid or the base, and the stoichiometric relationship between them, you calculatethe concentration of the other reactant. The equivalence point in the
titration occurs when just enough acid and base have been mixed for acomplete reaction to occur, with no excess of either reactant. As youlearned in Chapter 8, you can ﬁnd the equivalence point from a graph that
shows pH versus volume of one solution added to the other solution. Todetermine the equivalence point experimentally, you need to measure thepH. Because pH meters are expensive, and the glass electrodes are fragile,titrations are often performed using an acid-base indicator.
An acid-base indicator is usually a weak, monoprotic organic acid.
The indicator is in equilibrium between the undissociated acid, which isone colour, and its conjugate base, which is a different colour.

For example, one indicator, called methyl red, is red when the pH is
below 4.2, and yellow when the pH is above 6.2. The point in a titrationat which an indicator changes colour is called the end-point . The colour
change occurs over a range of about 2 pH units, but the pH of a solutionchanges rapidly near the equivalence point. Often a single drop of basecauses the shift from colour 1 to colour 2. For methyl red, the end-pointoccurs over the pH range 4.2 to 6.2. Therefore, this indicator is used whenan acid-base titration results in a moderately acidic solution at equiva-lence. Figure 9.3 shows the colours and end-points of various indicators.
A range of indicators are available with different end-points are available.
Thymol blue and alizarin are diprotic . They change colour over two different ranges.
To choose the appropriate indicator for a particular titration, you must
know the approximate pH of the solution at equivalence. As you learnedin Chapter 8, an acid-base titration curve provides this information. What if you do not have a titration curve? You can calculate the pH at equivalence using what you know about salts.Figure 9.3Crystal violet

against a weak base. At the equivalence point, the ﬂask contains an

Specific Expectations  Solubility Equilibria
In Chapter 7, you learned that a saturated solution containing undissolved
solute is an example of a system at equilibrium. Recall from your previouschemistry course that the solubility of a solute is the amount of solute that will dissolve in a given volume of solvent at a certain temperature. In other words, the solubility of a solute indicates how much of thatsolute is present in a solution at equilibrium. Data tables often expresssolubility as (g solute)/(100 mL solvent). Molar solubility, on the otherhand, is always expressed in terms of (mol solute/L solvent).
The solubility of ionic solids in water covers a wide range of values.
Knowing the concentration of ions in aqueous solution is important inmedicine and in chemical analysis. In this section, you will continue tostudy equilibrium. You will examine the solubility equilibria of ioniccompounds in water.
Solubility as an Equilibrium Process
In Chapter 7, you learned that three factors —change in enthalpy ( ∆H),
change in entropy ( ∆S), and temperature ( T)—determine whether or not a
change is favoured. The same three factors are important for determininghow much of a salt will dissolve in a certain volume of water. These factors are combined in the following equation, where ∆Gis the change
in free energy of the system.
∆G=∆H−T∆S
As you know from Chapter 7, a change is favoured when ∆Gis negative.
When a salt dissolves, the entropy of the system always increases, because ions in solution are more disordered than ions in a solid crystal.An increase in entropy favours the formation of a solution because theterm −T∆Sis negative. Most solids dissolve to a greater extent at higher
solution temperatures, because the term −T∆Sbecomes more negative.
Explaining the overall enthalpy change for a dissolving salt is more
complicated because it involves a number of energy changes. Cationsmust be separated from anions, which requires energy. Water moleculesthen surround each ion in solution, which releases energy. If the overallenthalpy change is negative, the formation of a solution is favoured. If theenthalpy increases, the formation of a solution is not favoured because ∆G
is less negative.
Heterogeneous Equilibrium: A Solubility System
Consider barium sulfate, a sparingly soluble salt. X-ray technicians givepatients a barium sulfate suspension to drink before taking an X-ray of thelarge intestine. A suspension of barium sulfate is opaque to X-rays, whichhelps to de ﬁne this part of the body. (See Figure 9.4.)
When you add barium sulfate crystals to water, barium ions and
sulfate ions leave the surface of the solid and enter the solution. Initially,the concentration of these ions is very low. Thus, the forward change, dissolving, occurs at a greater rate than the reverse change:
BaSO
4(s)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfBa2+(aq)+SO42−(aq)
Barium sulfate,
BaSO 4, is a sparingly soluble ionic
compound that is used to enhanceX-ray imaging.Figure 9.4
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria • MHR 431As more ions enter the solution, the rate of the reverse change,
recrystallisation, increases. Eventually, the rate of recrystallisation becomesequal to the rate of dissolving. As you know, when the forward rate andthe backward rate of a process are equal, the system is at equilibrium.Because the reactants and the products are in different phases, the reactionis said to have reached heterogeneous equilibrium. For solubility systemsof sparingly soluble ionic compounds, equilibrium exists between the solid
ionic compound and its dissociated ions in solution .
The Solubility Product Constant
When excess solid is present in a saturated solution , you can write the
equilibrium constant expression for the dissolution of the solid in thesame way that you wrote the equilibrium constant expression for a homogeneous equilibrium in Chapter 7. For example, the equilibriumconstant expression for barium sulfate is written as follows:
K=[Ba
2+(aq)][SO 42−(aq)]
[BaSO 4(s)]
The concentration of a solid, however, is itself a constant at a constant
temperature. Therefore, you can combine the term for the concentration of the solid with the equilibrium constant to arrive at a new constant:
K[BaSO
4(s)]=[Ba2+
(aq)][SO 42−
(aq)]
Ksp=[Ba2+
(aq)][SO 42−
(aq)]
The new constant is called the solubility product constant, Ksp.
The following Sample Problem shows how to write expressions for Ksp.

432 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and EquilibriumYou know intuitively that solubility depends on temperature. For
most ionic compounds, more solute can dissolve in a solvent at highertemperatures. Chemists determine the solubility of an ionic compound byexperiment, and then use the solubility data to determine K
sp. Like the
equilibrium constant, Kspis temperature-dependent. Therefore, different
experiments must be carried out to determine Kspat different temperatures.
Chemical reference books list the solubility of a wide variety of
compounds. In the next Sample Problem, you will learn how to use measured solubilities to determine K

less soluble at higher tempera-

Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria • MHR 433Determining a Solubility Product Constant
In Investigation 9-A, you will collect solubility data and use these data to
determine a Kspfor calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2. When you calculate Ksp,
you assume that the dissolved ionic compound exists as independenthydrated ions that do not affect one another. This assumption simpli ﬁes
the investigation, but it is not entirely accurate. Ions dointerfere with
one another. As a result, the value of K
spthat you calculate will be just
an approximation. Kspvalues that are calculated from data obtained
from experiments such as Investgation 9-A are generally higher than theactual values.13.The maximum solubility of silver cyanide, AgCN, is 1.5×10−8mol/L

The Common Ion Effect
So far, you have considered solubility equilibria for pure substances
dissolved in water. What happens to the solubility of an ionic compoundwhen it is added to a solution that already contains one of its ions?

Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions and Solubility Equilibria • MHR 437A solution of a salt that contains chromate ions, such as sodium
chromate, Na2CrO 4(aq), is added to the mixture. More yellow lead(II)
chromate precipitates out of solution, as shown in Figure 9.5(B).
As you learned in Chapter 8, this phenomenon is called the common
ion effect. The observed result is predicted by Le Ch âtelier ’s principle.
Adding a common ion to a solution increases the concentration of that ionin solution. As a result, equilibrium shifts away from the ion. In thisexample, adding chromate ions causes the equilibrium to shift to the left,and lead(II) chromate precipitates.

Since Kspis a constant at a given temperature, an increase in the
concentration of one ion must be accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of the other ion, achieved by the formation of a precipitate.This explains why solid lead(II) chromate precipitates out of solution.
The next Sample Problem shows how to predict the solubility of an

Therefore, in the ( 0.10 +x) term, xcan be ignored. In other words,

simplify the equation as follows:

Dr. Joseph MacInnis has a medical degree, but
he does not work in a clinic, a hospital, or a typicaldoctor ’s ofﬁce. His of ﬁce is the ocean, and he is an
expert in deep-sea diving. He combines his medicalexpertise with his knowledge of the properties of gases to study the effects of deep-sea diving on humans.
MacInnis was born in Barrie, Ontario, in 1937. In
1963, after graduating from the University ofToronto ’s medical school, he received a fellowship
to study diving medicine at the University ofPennsylvania. Diving medicine is a specialized ﬁeld,
dealing with the challenges that humans face whenexposed to undersea environments.
For every 10 m below sea level that a diver
descends under water, ambient pressure increasesby one unit of atmospheric pressure. This increase inpressure, and its effect on heterogeneous equilibriain the body, is one of the most profound challenges
that a diver encounters. As a diver descends, and is subjected to increased pressure, gases such asnitrogen dissolve in the blood and tissues. In theequilibrium between dissolved nitrogen and gaseousnitrogen, increased pressure favours dissolved nitrogen, according to Le Ch âtelier ’s principle. As the
diver ascends to the ocean surface and pressuredecreases, equilibrium favours the nitrogen comingout of solution.
If a diver ascends too quickly, the lungs cannot
remove the nitrogen fast enough. Gas bubbles formin the blood, causing decompression sickness.Decompression sickness is also known as “the
bends, ” because one of its symptoms is an inability
to bend the joints.
MacInnis was a consultant to the team that dis-
covered the Titanic , and he was the ﬁrst Canadian to
explore the wreck. In 1991, MacInnis and his teamused small submarines with pressurized hulls to ﬁlm
the wreck in IMAX format. The wreck is about 4000 mbelow sea level, but the pressure inside the sub-marines was kept similar to the pressure above thesurface of the sea.
MacInnis is passionate about the environment,
both below and above the sea. Since 1996, MacInnis has been Chair of the Friends of theEnvironment Foundation, a non-pro ﬁt organization
that funds projects that help to protect Canada ’s
environment. In recognition of his accomplishments,MacInnis was made a member of the Order ofCanada in 1976.

Buffers and the Common Ion Effect
In Chapter 8, you learned that buffers resist changes in pH when acids or
bases are added. Buffers have many uses in a chemistry lab. For example,commercial buffers with certi ﬁed pH values are available. Chemists in
analytical laboratories use these acidic, basic, and neutral buffers toensure the accuracy of their pH meters across the pH range.
Recall, from Chapter 8, that a buffer consists of a weak acid/conjugate
base mixture or a weak base/conjugate acid mixture. One buffer that you examined previously contains acetic acid and sodium acetate. Thecommon-ion effect applies to this buffer. The equilibrium of the aceticacid is affected by the common acetate ion from sodium acetate.
Since buffers are an example of the common-ion effect, the concentra-
tion of ions (hence the pH) of a buffer solution can be calculated using amethod that is similar to the method you used to determine solubility in acommon ion effect problem. You will use K
a, however, instead of Ksp.
Also, buffers are in homogeneous equilibria, unlike saturated solubilitysystems, which are in heterogeneous equilibria. Therefore, you need toconsider the initial concentration of the reactants. (The reactants are notsolids, so their concentration is not constant.)

In section 9.2, you worked with concentrations of ions in solutions at

in pure water and in solutions of common ions. The systems you workedwith were saturated solutions that contained excess, undissolved solute.
How do you predict whether a given concentration of ions will result
in the precipitation of an ionic compound? How can you tell if a solutionis saturated? You substitute the concentrations of the ions into an expres-sion that is identical to the solubility product expression. Because these concentrations may not be the same as the concentrations that the equilibrium system would have, however, the expression has a differentname: the ion product.
Comparing the Ion Product With the Solubility Product
The ion product, Qsp, is an expression that is identical to the solubility
product constant, but its value is calculated using concentrations that are not necessarily those at equilibrium. (The relationship between theexpression for solubility product, K
sp, and the expression for the ion
product, Qsp, is analogous to the relationship between the equilibrium
constant, Kc, and the reaction quotient, Qc.)
For example, suppose that you slowly add an ionic compound,
such as magnesium sulfate, MgSO 4, to water in a beaker. The following
equation represents the dissociation.
MgSO4(s)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfMg2+
(aq)+SO42−(aq) Ksp=5.9×10−3
Initially, all the magnesium sulfate dissolves. The solution is not at
equilibrium as long as more solid can dissolve. As you add more solid,however, the solution reaches equilibrium. The solution is saturated, and no more salt will dissolve. If you continue to add magnesium sulfateto the water, you will see an increasing amount of solid in the beaker.
The ion product expression for magnesium sulfate is written
as follows:
Q
sp=[Mg2+][SO 42−]
You calculate Qspby substituting the concentration of each ion into
the expression. If Qspis larger than Ksp, the product of the concentrations of
the ions is greater than it would be at equilibrium. For the system to attainequilibrium, some of the ions must leave the solution by precipitation.Conversely, if
Qspis less than Ksp, the product of the concentration of the
ions is smaller than it is at equilibrium. Therefore, the solution is not yetsaturated and more ions can be added to the solution without any precipitation. The relationship between
Qspand Kspfor the dissociation of
a slightly soluble ionic compound is summarized on the next page. Use thefollowing general equation as a reference.

Using the Ion Product Expression
You can use the relationship between the ion product expression and the
solubility product expression to predict whether a precipitate will form in a given system. One common system involves mixing solutions of twosoluble ionic compounds, which react to form an ionic compound with avery low solubility. If
Qsp>Ksp, based on the initial concentrations of the
ions in solution, the sparingly soluble compound will form a precipitate.
How do you know which ionic compounds are soluble and which are
not? In your previous chemistry course, you learned a set of solubilityguidelines. Table 9.3 summarizes these guidelines. Remember: the higherguideline takes precedence. (For instance, guideline 3 says that carbonateshave very low solubility. Sodium carbonate is soluble, however, becauseguideline 1 says that ionic compounds containing sodium are soluble.)Chemists do not usually work with solubility products for soluble compounds. Thus, you will not ﬁnd soluble ionic compounds listed in
Ksp
tables. If you see a compound in a Ksptable, you know that it has a low
solubility relative to compounds such as sodium chloride.
Table 9.3 General Solubility Guidelines
For example, silver nitrate and sodium chloride are both soluble ionic
compounds. When they are mixed in solution, however, they react to formsilver chloride, as shown in Figure 9.7. The equation for the reaction is:
AgNO
3(aq) +NaCl (aq)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfAgCl (s)+NaNO 3(aq)
Silver chloride has a very low solubility. Therefore, a precipitate will form
even if the initial concentration of chloride and silver ions is very small.The following Sample Problems show you how to decide whether a precipitate will form under a given set of conditions. Li+, Na+, K+

A common test for chloride ions in a solution involves adding AgNO 3(ag)

Analytical Applications of Precipitation Reactions
In the previous Sample Problems, you saw that combining solutions of
soluble ionic compounds can cause the precipitation of a slightly solubleionic compound. Analytical chemists use precipitation reactions toremove ions from solution or to identify ions in an unknown solution.
Fractional Precipitation
Suppose a chemist has a solution that contains several similar ions. The
chemist wants to remove some of these ions, while leaving other ions insolution. One way to do this is by fractional precipitation : a process in
which ions are selectively precipitated from solution, leaving other ions.
For example, consider a solution that contains three halide ions: Cl
−,
Br−, and I−. Since these halides all come from the same group on the
periodic table, they share many properties. When they are the anions inslightly soluble ionic compounds, however, they have different solubilities.(See Table 9.4.) Therefore, chemists can use fractional precipitation to separate them from solution.
Table 9.4 Values of Kspfor Silver Halides
Out of the three compounds, silver chloride is the most soluble and
silver iodide is the least soluble. (You can compare the solubilities of the compounds based on their solubility products because they are all the same type. Each formula unit contains two ions.)
To separate the halide ions, a chemist adds silver ions to the solution
until most of the iodide ions precipitate out as AgI. The chemist stopsadding silver ions before AgBr begins to precipitate. The chemist thenremoves the solid AgI by ﬁltration or by using a centrifuge, as shown in
Figure 9.8. To remove the bromide ions, the chemist repeats the processwith the remaining solution. The chemist adds silver ions until most ofthe bromide ions precipitate out as AgBr, but stops adding ions beforeAgCl begins to precipitate. By ﬁltering or centrifuging again, the chemist
obtains a solution that contains only chloride ions.

Bauxite is the most abundant
ore of aluminum. The ﬁrst step
in extracting aluminum frombauxite is called the Bayer
process . The Bayer process
involves a fractional precipita-tion of impurities, includingiron(III) oxide and titaniumdioxide. Search the Internet toﬁnd the history of the Bayer
process and learn how itworks. Present your ﬁndings
as a poster. To start yoursearch, go to the web siteabove and click on Web Links .LINK WebQualitative Analysis
As well as separating similar ions out of solution, chemists can also use
their understanding of solubility and precipitation reactions to identifyunknown ions in solution. Qualitative analysis is the branch of analytical
chemistry that involves identifying elements, compounds, and ions insamples of unknown or uncertain composition. The other branch of analytical chemistry is quantitative analysis . In quantitative analysis,
analytical chemists determine how much of a compound, element, or ion
is in a sample.
One way to identify cations in solution is by selectively precipitating
them out of solution. As you know, cations may form soluble or insolubleionic compounds, depending on the anions that are present. For example,copper(II) chloride, CuCl
2is soluble in water. Copper(II) sul ﬁde, CuS, is
insoluble in an acidic solution. Knowing about the relative solubility ofcations when combined with various anions helps chemists identify them.
Using precipitation reactions to identify cations was once a common
part of qualitative analyses. Today, chemists usually identify and quantifyunknowns using instruments such as spectrophotometers. However,examining the identi ﬁcation of cations through precipitation reactions
allows you to see how solubility equilibria can be manipulated. It alsoprovides an opportunity to solve a chemical “mystery ”—what is in the
unknown solution?
To ﬁnd out what cations are in a solution using precipitation reactions,
chemists carry out reactions according to a scheme that incorporates tests
for each component that may be present. One example of such a scheme isshown in Figure 9.9. This scheme shows how a chemist would analyze anunknown solution that may contain all, some, or none of the followingions: silver, Ag
+; cadmium, Cd2+; and aluminium, Al3+. The analysis uses
selective, step by step precipitation.

want to test an unknown solution that contains someor all of the following ions: silver, Ag
+; arsenic, As3+;
chromium, Cr3+; and sodium, Na+. Your laboratory
assistant has already performed some tests onknown solutions of these ions and has made the following observations:
•As3+forms a precipitate when H2S(aq)is added.
Cr3+and Na+do not form a precipitate when
H2S(aq)is added.
•Ag+forms a precipitate when HCl (aq)is added. The
other ions do not form a precipitate when HCl (aq)
is added.
•Cr3+forms a precipitate when a solution of NH 3is
added. (Making the solution basic has the sameeffect as adding OH

in a basic solution.
•Na+produces a bright yellow ﬂame in a ﬂame test.
Procedure
1.Based on these observations, devise a step-by-
step scheme for testing an unknown solution.The solution may contain all, some, or just oneof the possible ions. Use Figure 9.9 to help you.

Section Summary
In Chapter 9, as in most of Unit 4, you learned about equilibrium reactions.
In this section, you analyzed precipitation reactions. You mainly examineddouble-displacement reactions —reactions in which two soluble ionic
compounds react to form a precipitate. You used the solubility productconstant, K
sp, to predict whether or not a precipitate would form for given
concentrations of ions. In Unit 5, you will learn about a class of reactionsthat will probably be new to you. You will see how these reactions inter-convert chemical and electrical energy.The scheme that is shown in Figure 9.9 is very simple. More complex
qualitative analyses involve many more steps of isolation and identi ﬁca-
tion, including some steps that are not precipitation reactions. For example, some ions, such as sodium, Na
+, and potassium, K+, cannot be
precipitated out of an aqueous solution, because the ionic compounds thatcontain them are always soluble. Instead, chemists identify these ionsusing a ﬂame test. In the following ThoughtLab, you will simulate a
qualitative analysis that includes a ﬂame test.

UNIT 4 An Issue to Analyze
Earth in Equilibrium
Background
Scientists often think about Earth as being composed
of four main systems. The biosphere includes all
living things on Earth. The geosphere includes
non-living things, such as rocks and soil. Thehydrosphere includes all water, such as oceans,
rivers, and even puddles. The atmosphere includes
gases, vapours, and aerosols. These four systemsoverlap in many ways. For example, animals are partof the biosphere, but they interact with componentsin the geosphere (living in a burrow or cave), thehydrosphere (drinking and excreting water), and theatmosphere (breathing).
Earth, with its four spheres, is a good approximation
of a closed system. As you learned in Unit 4, aclosed system is subject to the principles of equilib-rium. Every change to the system affects the wholeequilibrium. Elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen regularly cycle through Earth’sfour spheres. Thus, Earth is in a constant dynamicequilibrium.Scientists have noticed various shifts in Earth’s
equilibrium in recent years. Since Earth is in adynamic equilibrium, some shifts occur naturally.There is considerable evidence, however, that thefollowing shifts have been caused by, or at leaststrongly inﬂuenced by, human activities. Some ofthese shifts may be familiar to you, with names such as “global warming,” “ozone holes,” and “lossof biodiversity.”
• an increase in
CO2and CH4levels in the
atmosphere
• an increase in the amounts and concentrations
of pollutant substances
• a decrease in ozone concentrations in certain
parts of the atmosphere
• an increase in average global temperature• a decrease in arable land and a corresponding
increase in desert land
• a loss of plant and animal species, both by
observable causes and by unknown causes
• an increase in extreme weather conditions,
such as hurricanes and tornadoes
For this unit issue, you will research the carbon
cycle, either on your own or as part of a group.Then, as a class, you will discuss the consequencesof human activities on the carbon cycle.
456 MHR • Unit 4  Chemical Systems and Equilibrium
Plan and Present
Research the carbon cycle. Include a general
description of how carbon moves through thegeosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmos-phere. (Your teacher may choose to have somemembers of the class research different cycles,such as the phosphorus cycle or the nitrogencycle.)
Identify speciﬁc chemical reactions and process-
es that involve the movement of carbon from onesystem to another. Write balanced equations foreach reaction or process you identify.
Use the reactions and processes you identiﬁed
in step 2, along with your knowledge of equilib-ria, to identify factors that can increase ordecrease the level of carbon in each system.
Identify human inﬂuences on the carbon cycle.Choose at least one shift in Earth’s equilibrium
that is listed in “Background.” For each shiftyou choose, answer the following questions.
(a)Is the carbon cycle involved? Explain youranswer.
(b)Where on Earth do you think this shift ismost visible? Explain why you think so.
(c)What are some possible causes of this shift?
(d)What are some possible consequences?
If you come across information about a shift in
Earth’s equilibrium that is not listed in“Background,” include a description of thisshift with your research.
Have a class discussion on the following topics.
(a)To what extent do human activities affect the
carbon cycle? Are the consequences of anyhuman activities serious enough to considerchanging these activities?
(b)If your answer to the second question in part(a) is yes, decide on a priority list of ﬁvehuman activities that your class believesshould be changed.
(c)Come up with an action plan for your schoolor community to address your concerns.Evaluate the Results
If your class developed a priority list of ﬁvehuman activities that need changing, list theseactivities in your notebook. Explain why eachactivity was chosen to be on the list.
Describe any solutions or suggestions that your
class developed. Are these suggestions likely towork? Why or why not?
Prepare a report that summarizes the results of
your own research on the carbon cycle.

Canadian engineer Dr. John Hopps,
working with a team of medicalresearchers in the late 1940s, developed one of the most signiﬁcantmedical inventions of the twentiethcentury: the pacemaker. The photo-graph on the right shows a pacemakerembedded in the body of a heartpatient. A modern pacemaker isessentially a tiny computer that monitors a person’s heartbeat andcorrects irregularities as needed.Pacemakers are particularly useful in correcting a heartbeat that is too slow.
The pacemaker device is
surgically placed in a “pocket” of tissue near the patient’s collarbone.One or more wires, called “leads,”are connected to the pacemaker andthreaded down through a major veinto the patient’s heart. By sendingelectrical impulses along the leads tothe heart, the pacemaker can inducea heartbeat.
A pacemaker obtains electrical
energy from a tiny battery that lastsfor about seven years before it mustbe replaced. But how do batteriessupply electrical energy? The answerlies in a branch of chemistry knownas electrochemistry. In this unit, you will learn about the connectionbetween chemical reactions and electricity. You will also learn aboutthe chemical reactions that take placeinside batteries.Electrochemistry

Concepts and Skills
Kitchen chemistry is an important part of daily life. Cooks use chemistry
all the time to prepare and preserve food. Even the simplest things you do in the kitchen can involve chemical reactions. For example, you haveprobably seen a sliced apple turn brown. The same thing happens to pears,bananas, avocados, and several other fruits. Slicing the fruit exposes theﬂesh to oxygen in the air. Compounds in the fruit react with oxygen to formbrown products. An enzyme in the fruit acts as a catalyst, speeding up thisreaction. How can you stop fruit from turning brown after it is sliced?
A Waldorf salad uses a simple method to prevent fruit from browning.
This type of salad usually consists of diced apples, celery, and walnuts,covered with a mayonnaise dressing. The dressing keeps the air awayfrom the food ingredients. Without air, the fruit does not turn brown.
Another way to solve this problem is to prevent the enzyme in the
fruit from acting as a catalyst. Enzymes are sensitive to pH. Therefore,adding an acid such as lemon juice or vinegar to fruit can prevent theenzyme from acting. You may have noticed that avocado salad recipesoften include lemon juice. In addition to hindering the enzyme, lemonjuice contains vitamin C, which is very reactive toward oxygen. The vitamin C reacts with oxygen before the sliced fruit can do so.
In this chapter, you will be introduced to oxidation-reduction
reactions, also called redox reactions. You will discover how to identifythis type of reaction. You will also ﬁnd out how to balance equations for a redox reaction.

Specific Expectations  10.1
Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 465Deﬁning Oxidation and Reduction
The term oxidation can be used to describe the process in which
certain fruits turn brown by reacting with oxygen. The original, historicaldeﬁnition of this term was “to combine with oxygen.” Thus, oxidationoccurred when iron rusted, and when magnesium was burned in oxygengas. The term reduction was used historically to describe the opposite
of oxidation, that is, the formation of a metal from its compounds. An ore
is a naturally occurring solid compound or mixture of compounds fromwhich a metal can be extracted. Thus, the process of obtaining a metalfrom an ore was known as a reduction. Copper ore was reduced to yieldcopper, and iron ore was reduced to yield iron.
As you will learn in this chapter, the modern deﬁnitions for oxidation
and reduction are much broader. The current deﬁnitions are based on theidea of electron transfers, and can now be applied to numerous chemicalreactions. In Unit 1, you saw the terms oxidation and reduction used todescribe changes to carbon-hydrogen and carbon-oxygen bonds withinorganic compounds. These changes involve electron transfers, so thebroader deﬁnitions that you will learn in this chapter still apply.
In your previous chemistry course, you compared the reactivities of
metals. You may recall that, when a piece of zinc is placed in an aqueoussolution of copper(II) sulfate, the zinc displaces the copper in a single displacement reaction. This reaction is shown in Figure 10.1. As the zinc dissolves, the zinc strip gets smaller. A dark red-brown layer of solid copper forms on the zinc strip, and some copper is deposited on the bottom of the beaker. The blue colour of the solution fades, as blue copper(II) ions are replaced by colourless zinc ions.
A solid zinc strip reacts with a solution that contains blue copper(II) ions. Figure 10.1
466 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryThe reaction in Figure 10.1 is represented by the following equation.
Zn(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→Cu(s)+ZnSO 4(aq)
This equation can be written as a total ionic equation.
Zn(s)+Cu2+(aq)+SO42−(aq)→Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq)+SO42−(aq)
The sulfate ions are spectator ions , meaning ions that are not involved
in the chemical reaction. By omitting the spectator ions, you obtain thefollowing net ionic equation.
Zn
(s)+Cu2+(aq)→Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq)
Notice what happens to the reactants in this equation. The zinc atoms
lose electrons to form zinc ions. The copper ions gain electrons to form
copper atoms.
The following chemical deﬁnitions describe these changes.
•Oxidation is the loss of electrons.
•Reduction is the gain of electrons.
In the reaction of zinc atoms with copper(II) ions, the zinc atoms lose
electrons and undergo oxidation. In other words, the zinc atoms are oxidized . The copper(II) ions gain electrons and undergo reduction.
In other words, the copper(II) ions are reduced . Because oxidation and
reduction both occur in the reaction, it is known as an oxidation-reduction
reaction or redox reaction .
Notice that electrons are transferred from zinc atoms to copper(II)
ions. The copper(II) ions are responsible for the oxidation of the zincatoms. A reactant that oxidizes another reactant is called an oxidizing
agent . The oxidizing agent accepts electrons in a redox reaction. In this
reaction, copper(II) is the oxidizing agent. The zinc atoms are responsiblefor the reduction of the copper(II) ions. A reactant that reduces anotherreactant is called a reducing agent . The reducing agent gives or donates
electrons in a redox reaction. In this reaction, zinc is the reducing agent.
A redox reaction can also be deﬁned as a reaction between an
oxidizing agent and a reducing agent, as illustrated in Figure 10.2.
In a redox reaction, the reducing agent is oxidized, and the oxidizing
agent is reduced. Note that the oxidizing agent does not undergo oxidation, and that
the reducing agent does not undergo reduction.Figure 10.2•reducing agent

oxidation and reduction. Forexample, in “LEO the lion says

Electrons is Oxidation. ” GER
stands for “Gain of Electrons
is Reduction. ” The mnemonic
“OIL RIG ” stands for
“Oxidation Is Loss. Reduction

mnemonic to help you remem-ber these de ﬁnitions.FACTCHEM
Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 467Try the following practice problems to review your understanding of net
ionic equations, and to work with the new concepts of oxidation andreduction.
Half-Reactions
To monitor the transfer of electrons in a redox reaction, you can represent the oxidation and reduction separately. A half-reaction is a
balanced equation that shows the number of electrons involved in eitheroxidation or reduction. Because a redox reaction involves both oxidationand reduction, two half-reactions are needed to represent a redox reaction.One half-reaction shows oxidation, and the other half-reaction showsreduction.
As you saw earlier, the reaction of zinc with aqueous copper(II) sulfate
can be represented by the following net ionic equation.
Zn
(s)+Cu2+(aq)→Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq)
Each neutral Zn atom is oxidized to form a Zn2+ion. Thus, each Zn atom
must lose two electrons. You can write an oxidation half-reaction to showthis change.
Zn
(s)→Zn2+(aq)+2e−
Each Cu2+ion is reduced to form a neutral Cu atom. Thus, each Cu2+ion
must gain two electrons. You can write a reduction half-reaction to showthis change.
Cu
2+(aq)+2e−→Cu(s)
If you look again at each half-reaction above, you will notice that
the atoms and the charges are balanced. Like other types of balancedequations, half-reactions are balanced using the smallest possible whole-number coef ﬁcients. In the following equation, the atoms and
charges are balanced, but the coef ﬁcients can all be divided by 2 to give
the usual form of the half-reaction.

2.Write a balanced net ionic equation for each reaction, including physical states.

(b)a solution of silver nitrate with metallic cadmium
3.Identify the reactant oxidized and the reactant reduced in each reaction in question 2.
4.Identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent in each reactionin question 2.Practice Problems
You can write separate
oxidation and reduction half-reactions to represent a redoxreaction, but one half-reactioncannot occur on its own.Explain why this statementmust be true.
In most redox reactions, one substance is oxidized and a different
substance is reduced. In a disproportionation reaction, however, a single
element undergoes both oxidation and reduction in the same reaction. For example, a copper(I) solution undergoes disproportionation in the following reaction.
2Cu
+(aq)→Cu(s)+Cu2+(aq)
In this reaction, some copper(I) ions gain electrons, while other copper(I)
ions lose electrons.
The two half-reactions are as follows.
Oxidation: Cu+(aq)→Cu2+(aq)+1e−
Reduction: Cu+(aq)+1e−→Cu(s)
You have learned that half-reactions can be used to represent oxidation
and reduction separately. Half-reactions always come in pairs: an oxidationhalf-reaction is always accompanied by a reduction half-reaction, and viceversa. Try writing and balancing half-reactions using the following practiceproblems.
You already know that some metals are more reactive than others. You
may also have carried out an investigation on the metal activity series in a previous course. In Investigation 10-A, located on page 470, you will discover how this series is related to oxidation and reduction. Youwill write chemical equations, ionic equations, and half-reactions for the single displacement reactions of several metals.5.Write balanced half-reactions from the net ionic equation for the

Aging: Is Oxidation a Factor?
Why do we grow old? Despite advances in
molecular biology and medical research, thereasons for aging remain mysterious. One theory suggests that aging may be in ﬂuenced
by oxidizing agents, also known as oxidants .
Oxidants are present in the environment
and in foods. Nitrogen oxides are oxidantspresent in cigarette smoke and urban smog.Other oxidants include the copper and ironsalts in meat and some plants. Inhaling andingesting oxidants such as these can increasethe level of oxidants in our bodies.
Oxidants are also naturally present in
the body, where they participate in importantredox reactions. For example, mitochondriaconsume oxygen during aerobic respiration,and cells ingest and destroy bacteria. Both theseprocesses involve oxidation and reduction.
As you have just seen, redox reactions
are an essential part of your body ’s processes.
However, these reactions can produce free
radicals , which are highly reactive atoms or
molecules with one or more unpaired electrons.Because they are so reactive, free radicals canoxidize surrounding molecules by robbingthem of electrons. This process can damageDNA, proteins, and other macromolecules.Such damage may contribute to aging, and to diseases that are common among the aging,such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, andcataracts.
The study of oxidative damage has sparked
a debate about the role that antioxidants might play in illness and aging. Antioxidants
are reducing agents. They donate electrons tosubstances that have been oxidized, decreasingthe damage caused by free radicals. Dietaryantioxidants include vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and carotenoids.
Most medical researchers agree that people
with diets rich in fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease,certain cancers, and cataracts. Although fruitsand vegetables are high in antioxidants, theyalso contain ﬁbre and many different vitamins Carotenoids are pigments found in some fruits and
vegetables, including spinach.
and plant chemicals. It is hard to disentangle
the effects of antioxidants from the bene ﬁcial
effects of these other substances.
As a result, the bene ﬁts of antioxidant
dietary supplements are under debate.According to one study, vitamin E supplementsmay lower the risk of heart disease. Anotherstudy, however, concludes that taking beta-carotene supplements does notreduce
the risk of certain cancers.
We can be sure that a balanced diet
including fruits and vegetables is bene ﬁcial
to human health. Whether antioxidants conferthese bene ﬁts, and whether these bene ﬁts
include longevity, remain to be seen.

Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 473Oxidation Numbers
Redox reactions are very common. Some of them produce light in a
process known as chemiluminescence . In living things, the production
of light in redox reactions is known as bioluminescence . You can actually
see the light from redox reactions occurring in some organisms, such asglowworms and ﬁreﬂies, as shown in Figure 10.3.
Fireﬂies use ﬂashes of light produced by redox reactions to attract a mate.
Not all redox reactions give off light, however. How can you recognize a
redox reaction, and how can you identify the oxidizing and reducingagents? In section 10.1, you saw net ionic equations with monatomic elements, such as Cu and Zn, and with ions containing a single element,such as Cu
2+and Zn2+. In these cases, you could use ionic charges to
describe the transfer of electrons. However, many redox reactions involvereactants or products with covalent bonds, including elements that exist as covalent molecules, such as oxygen, O
2; covalent compounds, such
as water, H2O; or polyatomic ions that are not spectator ions, such as
permanganate, MnO 4−. For reactions involving covalent reactants and
products, you cannot use ionic charges to describe the transfer of electrons.
Oxidation numbers are actual or hypothetical charges, assigned using
a set of rules. They are used to describe redox reactions with covalentreactants or products. They are also used to identify redox reactions, andto identify oxidizing and reducing agents. In this section, you will seehow oxidation numbers were developed from Lewis structures, and thenlearn the rules to assign oxidation numbers.
Oxidation Numbers from Lewis Structures
You are probably familiar with the Lewis structure of water, shown inFigure 10.4A. From the electronegativities on the periodic table in Figure 10.5, on the next page, you can see that oxygen (electronegativity3.44) is more electronegative than hydrogen (electronegativity 2.20). Theelectronegativity difference is less than 1.7, so the two hydrogen-oxygenbonds are polar covalent, not ionic. In each bond, the electrons are morestrongly attracted to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atom.

bookkeeping method used tokeep track of electron trans-fers. In a covalent molecule ora polyatomic ion, the oxidationnumber of each element doesnotrepresent an ionic charge,
because the elements are notpresent as ions. However, toassign oxidation numbers tothe elements in a covalentmolecule or polyatomic ion,you can pretend the bonds
are ionic.FACTCHEM
474 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryTo assign oxidation numbers to the atoms in a water molecule, you
can consider all the bonding electrons to be “owned ” by the more elec-
tronegative oxygen atom, as shown in Figure 10.4B. Thus, each hydrogenatom in a water molecule is considered to have no electrons, as hydrogenwould in a hydrogen ion, H
+. Therefore, the element hydrogen is assigned
an oxidation number of +1 in water. On the other hand, the oxygen atom
in a water molecule is considered to have a ﬁlled octet of electrons, as
oxygen would in an oxide ion, O2−. Therefore, the element oxygen is
assigned an oxidation number of −2 in water. ( Note: These are notionic
charges, since water is a covalent molecule. Also, note that the plus orminus sign in an oxidation number, such as −2, is written before the
number. The plus or minus sign in an ionic charge, such as 2 −, is written
after the number.)
The periodic table, showing electronegativity values
In a chlorine molecule, Cl2, each atom has the same electronegativity, so
the bond is non-polar covalent. Because the electrons are equally shared,you can consider each chlorine atom to “own” one of the shared elec-

Figure 10.7 shows how oxidation numbers are assigned for the
polyatomic cyanide ion, CN−. The electronegativity of nitrogen (3.04) is
greater than the electronegativity of carbon (2.55). Thus, the three sharedpairs of electrons are all considered to belong to the nitrogen atom. As a result, the carbon atom is considered to have two valence electrons,which is two electrons less than the four valence electrons of a neutralcarbon atom. Therefore, the carbon atom in CN
−is assigned an oxidation
number of +2. The nitrogen atom is considered to have eight valence
electrons, which is three electrons more than the ﬁve valence electrons of
a neutral nitrogen atom. Therefore, the nitrogen atom in CN−is assigned
an oxidation number of −3.

476 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryUsing Rules to Find Oxidation Numbers
Drawing Lewis structures to assign oxidation numbers can be a very
time-consuming process for large molecules or large polyatomic ions.Instead, the results from Lewis structures have been summarized to produce a more convenient set of rules, which can be applied more quickly. Table 10.1 summarizes the rules used to assign oxidation numbers. You may have discovered some of these rules for yourself in the ThoughtLab you just completed.
Table 10.1 Oxidation Number Rules
Some oxidation numbers found using these rules are not integers. For
example, an important iron ore called magnetite has the formula Fe3O4.
Using the oxidation number rules, you can assign oxygen an oxidationnumber of −2, and calculate an oxidation number of +
8
3for iron. However,
magnetite contains no iron atoms with this oxidation number. It actuallycontains iron(III) ions and iron(II) ions in a 2:1 ratio. The formula of magnetite is sometimes written as Fe
2O3•FeO to indicate that there are
two different oxidation numbers. The value +8
3for the oxidation number
of iron is an average value.
2(+3)+(+2)
3=+8

Even though some oxidation numbers found using these rules are
averages, the rules are still useful for monitoring electron transfers inredox reactions.Rules Examples
/lscript 1.A pure element has an oxidation
number of 0.
2.The oxidation number of an element
in a monatomic ion equals the charge of the ion.
3.The oxidation number of hydrogen
in its compounds is +1, except in
metal hydrides, where the oxidation number of hydrogen is −1.
4.The oxidation number of oxygen in
its compounds is usually −2, but
there are exceptions. These include peroxides, such as H
2O2, and the
compound OF 2.
5.In covalent compounds that do not
contain hydrogen or oxygen, the more electronegative element is assigned an oxidation number that  equals the negative charge it usually has in its ionic compounds.
6.The sum of the oxidation numbers
of all the elements in a compound is 0.
7.The sum of the oxidation numbers
of all the elements in a polyatomic ion equals the charge on the ion.Na in Na
(s), Br in Br 2( ), and P in P 4(s)
all have an oxidation number of 0.
The oxidation number of Al in Al3+
is +3. The oxidation number of Se in
Se2− is −2.
The oxidation number of H in H 2S or
CH4 is +1. The oxidation number of H
in NaH or in CaH 2 is −1.
The oxidation number of O in Li 2O or
in KNO 3 is −2.
The oxidation number of Cl in PCl 3 is
−1. The oxidation number of S in CS 2
is −2.
In CF 4, the oxidation number of F is −1,
and the oxidation number of C is +4.
(+4) + 4(−1) = 0
In NO 2−, the oxidation number of O is
−2, and the oxidation number of N is +3.
(+3) + 2(−2) = −1
Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 477In the following Sample Problem, you will ﬁnd out how to apply
these rules to covalent molecules and polyatomic ions.
Problem
Assign an oxidation number to each element.
(a)SiBr 4 (b)HClO 4 (c)Cr2O72−
Solution
(a)•Because the compound SiBr 4does not contain hydrogen or oxygen,
rule 5 applies. Because SiBr 4is a compound, rule 6 also applies.
•Silicon has an electronegativity of 1.90. Bromine has an
electronegativity of 2.96. From rule 5, therefore, you can assignbromine an oxidation number of
−1.
•The oxidation number of silicon is unknown, so let it be x. You
know from rule 6 that the sum of the oxidation numbers is 0. Then,
x+4(−1)=0
x−4=0
x=4
The oxidation number of silicon is +4. The oxidation number of bromine
is −1.
(b)•Because the compound HClO 4contains hydrogen and oxygen,
rules 3 and 4 apply. Because HClO 4is a compound, rule 6 also
applies.
•Hydrogen has its usual oxidation number of +1. Oxygen has its
usual oxidation number of −2. The oxidation number of chlorine
is unknown, so let it be x. You know from rule 6 that the sum of
the oxidation numbers is 0. Then,
(+1)+x+4(−2)=0
x−7=0
x=7
The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1. The oxidation number
of chlorine is +7. The oxidation number of oxygen is −2.
(c)•Because the polyatomic ion Cr2O72−contains oxygen, rule 4
applies. Because Cr2O72−is a polyatomic ion, rule 7 also applies.
•Oxygen has its usual oxidation number of −2.
•The oxidation number of chromium is unknown, so let it be x.
You know from rule 7 that the sum of the oxidation numbers is −2.
Then,
2x+7(−2)=−2
2x−14=−2
2x=12
x=6
The oxidation number of chromium is +6. The oxidation number of
oxygen is −2.Sample Problem
Assigning Oxidation Numbers
When ﬁnding the oxidation
numbers of elements in ioniccompounds, you can workwith the ions separately. Forexample, Na
2Cr2O7contains
two Na+ions, and so sodium
has an oxidation number of +1.
The oxidation numbers of Crand O can then be calculatedas shown in part (c) of theSample Problem.PROBLEM TIP

You have seen that the single displacement reaction of zinc with
copper(II) sulfate is a redox reaction, represented by the following chemical equation and net ionic equation.
Zn
(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→Cu(s)+ZnSO 4(aq)
Zn(s)+Cu2+(aq)→Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq)
Each atom or ion shown in the net ionic equation can be assigned
an oxidation number. Zn has an oxidation number of 0; Cu2+has an
oxidation number of +2; Cu has an oxidation number of 0; and Zn2+has
an oxidation number of +2. Thus, there are changes in oxidation numbers
in this reaction. The oxidation number of zinc increases, while the oxidation number of copper decreases.
In the oxidation half-reaction, the element zinc undergoes an increase
in its oxidation number from 0 to +2.

Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 479Therefore, you can describe oxidation and reduction as follows. (Also see
Figure 10.8.)
•Oxidation is an increase in oxidation number.
•Reduction is a decrease in oxidation number.
You can also monitor changes in oxidation numbers in reactions that
involve covalent molecules. For example, oxidation number changesoccur in the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water.

Because hydrogen combines with oxygen in this reaction, hydrogen
undergoes oxidation, according to the historical de ﬁnition given at the
beginning of section 10.1. Hydrogen also undergoes oxidation accordingto the modern de ﬁnition, because the oxidation number of hydrogen
increases from 0 to +1. Hydrogen is the reducing agent in this reaction.
The oxygen undergoes reduction, because its oxidation number decreasesfrom 0 to −2. Oxygen is the oxidizing agent in this reaction.
The following Sample Problem illustrates how to use oxidation num-
bers to identify redox reactions, oxidizing agents, and reducing agents.
Problem
Determine whether each of the following reactions is a redox reaction.
If so, identify the oxidizing agent and the reducing agent.

(b)CaCO 3(s)+2HCl (aq)→CaCl 2(aq) +H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)
Solution
Find the oxidation number of each element in the reactants and
products. Identify any elements that undergo an increase or a decrease in oxidation number during the reaction.
(a)The oxidation number of each element in the reactants and productsis as shown.
CH4(g)+Cl2(g)→CH3Cl(g)+HCl (g)

•The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1 on both sides of the
equation, so hydrogen is neither oxidized nor reduced.
•Both carbon and chlorine undergo changes in oxidation number, so
the reaction is a redox reaction.
•The oxidation number of carbon increases from −4 to −2. The car-
bon atoms on the reactant side exist in methane molecules, CH4(g),
so methane is oxidized. Therefore, methane is the reducing agent.
•The oxidation number of chlorine decreases from 0 to −1, so
elemental chlorine, Cl2(g), is reduced. Therefore, elemental chlorine
is the oxidizing agent.
(b)Because this reaction involves ions, write the equation in its totalionic form.

Historically, the extraction of a metal from its ore was known as
reduction. One way to reduce iron ore on an industrial scale is to use a huge reaction vessel, 30 m to 40 m high, called a blast furnace. Thereactants in a blast furnace are an impure iron ore, such as Fe
2O3,
mixed with limestone, CaCO 3, and coke, C, which is made from coal.
The solid mixture is fed into the top of the blast furnace. A blast ofvery hot air, at about 900 ˚C, is blown in near the bottom of the furnace.
The following reactions occur.

Did you know that redox reactions are an important part of CD
manufacturing? The CDs you buy at a music store are made of Lexan,
the same plastic used for riot shields and bulletproof windows. The CDsare coated with a thin aluminum ﬁlm. They are copies of a single master
disc, which is made of glass coated with silver, as seen in Figure 10.9.Silver is deposited on a glass disc by the reduction of silver ions withmethanal, HCHO, also known as formaldehyde. In the same reaction,formaldehyde is oxidized to methanoic acid, HCOOH, also known asformic acid. The redox reaction occurs under acidic conditions.
The production of CDs depends on a redox reaction used to coat the master
disc with silver.
You have seen many balanced chemical equations and net ionic equations
that represent redox reactions. There are speci ﬁc techniques for balancing
these equations. These techniques are especially useful for reactions thattake place under acidic or basic conditions, such as the acidic conditionsused in coating a master CD with silver.
In section 10.1, you learned to divide the balanced equations for some
redox reactions into separate oxidation and reduction half-reactions. Youwill now use the reverse approach, and discover how to write a balancedequation by combining two half-reactions. To do this, you must ﬁrst
understand how to write a wide range of half-reactions.Figure 10.9

In the synthesis of potassium chloride from its elements, metallic
potassium is oxidized to form potassium ions, and gaseous chlorine isreduced to form chloride ions. This reaction is shown in Figure 10.10.Each half-reaction can be balanced by writing the correct formulas for the reactant and product, balancing the numbers of atoms, and thenadding the correct number of electrons to balance the charges. For the oxidation half-reaction,

The atoms are balanced. The net charge on each side is 0. For the

Cl2+2e−→2Cl−
The atoms are balanced. The net charge on each side is −2.
Grey potassium metal, which is stored under oil, reacts very vigorously with
greenish-yellow chlorine gas to form white potassium chloride. The changes in oxidationnumbers show that this synthesis reaction is also a redox reaction.
Redox reactions do not always take place under neutral conditions.
Balancing half-reactions is more complicated for reactions that take placein acidic or basic solutions. When an acid or base is present, H
+or OH−
ions must also be considered. However, the overall approach is similar.
This approach involves writing the correct formulas for the reactants andproducts, balancing the atoms, and adding the appropriate number ofelectrons to one side of the half-reaction to balance the charges.Figure 10.10

Half-Reaction Method for Balancing Redox Reactions
Recall that, if you consider a redox reaction as two half-reactions,
electrons are lost in the oxidation half-reaction, and electrons are gainedin the reduction half-reaction. For example, you know the reaction of zinc with aqueous copper(II) sulfate.
Zn
(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→Cu(s)+ZnSO 4(aq)
Removing the spectator ions leaves the following net ionic equation.
Zn(s)+Cu2+(aq)→Cu(s)+Zn2+(aq)
•You can break the net ionic equation into two half-reactions:
Oxidation half-reaction: Zn→Zn2++2e−
Reduction half-reaction: Cu2++2e−→Cu
•You can also start with the half-reactions and use them to produce a net
ionic equation. If you add the two half-reactions, the result is as follows.
Zn+Cu2++2e−→Cu+Zn2++2e−
Removing the two electrons from each side results in the original net
ionic equation.
As shown above, you can use half-reactions to write balanced net
ionic equations for redox reactions. In doing so, you use the fact that no electrons are created or destroyed in a redox reaction . Electrons
are transferred from one reactant (the reducing agent) to another (the oxidizing agent).
Balancing a Net Ionic Equation
You know from Investigation 10-A that magnesium metal, Mg
(s), displaces
aluminum from an aqueous solution of one of its compounds, such as aluminum nitrate, Al(NO
3)3(aq). To obtain a balanced net ionic equation
for this reaction, you can start by looking at the half-reactions. Magnesiumatoms undergo oxidation to form magnesium ions, which have a 2 +
charge. The oxidation half-reaction is as follows.
Mg→Mg
2++2e−
Aluminum ions, which have a 3 +charge, undergo reduction to form
aluminum atoms. The reduction half-reaction is as follows.

Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 487The lowest or least common
multiple (LCM) of two numbersis the smallest multiple of eachnumber. For example, the LCMof 2 and 1 is 2; the LCM of 3and 6 is 6; and the LCM of 2and 5 is 10. One way to ﬁnd the
LCM of two numbers is to listthe multiples of each numberand to ﬁnd the smallest num-
ber that appears in both lists.For the numbers 6 and 8,
•the multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,…
•the multiples of 8 are:
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, …
Thus, the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24.
What is the LCM of the
numbers 4 and 12?
What is the LCM of the
numbers 7 and 3?LINK MathTo balance the net ionic equation for this redox reaction, you can
combine the two half-reactions in such a way that the number of electronslost through oxidation equals the number of electrons gained throughreduction. In other words, you can model the transfer of a certain numberof electrons from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent.
For the reaction of magnesium metal with aluminum ions, the two
balanced half-reactions include different numbers of electrons, 2 and 3.The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. To combine the half-reactionsand give a balanced net ionic equation, multiply the balanced half-reactions by different numbers so that the results both include six electrons, as shown below.
•Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3. Multiply the reduction
half-reaction by 2.

spectator ions, which are nitrate ions in this example. Include the states,if necessary. The balanced chemical equation is:

Steps for Balancing by the Half-Reaction Method
You could balance the chemical equation for the reaction of magnesium
with aluminum nitrate by inspection, instead of writing half-reactions.However, many redox equations are dif ﬁcult to balance by the inspection
method. In general, you can balance the net ionic equation for a redoxreaction by a process known as the half-reaction method. The precedingexample of the reaction of magnesium with aluminum nitrate illustratesthis method. Speci ﬁc steps for following the half-reaction method are
given below.
Step 1 Write an unbalanced net ionic equation, if it is not alreadygiven.
Step 2 Divide the unbalanced net ionic equation into an oxidationhalf-reaction and a reduction half-reaction. To do this, you may need to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements inthe net ionic equation to determine what is oxidized and whatis reduced.
Step 3 Balance the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction independently.
Step 4 Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers of electrons in the oxidation half-reaction and the reductionhalf-reaction.
Continued on the next page
When using the half-reaction method, keep in mind that, in a redox
reaction, the number of electrons lost through oxidation must equal the
number of electrons gained through reduction . Figure 10.11 provides
another example.
Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic and Basic Solutions
The half-reaction method of balancing equations can be more complicatedfor reactions that take place under acidic or basic conditions. The overallapproach, however, is the same. You need to balance the two half-reactions,ﬁnd the LCM of the numbers of electrons, and then multiply by coef ﬁcients
to equate the number of electrons lost and gained. Finally, add the half-reactions and simplify to give a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction. The ten steps listed above show this process in more detail.
The Sample Problem on the next page illustrates the use of these
steps for an acidic solution. To balance a net ionic equation for basic conditions by the half-reaction method, balance each half-reaction foracidic conditions, adjust for basic conditions, and then combine the half-reactions to obtain the balanced net ionic equation.

The Breathalyzer Test:
A Redox Reaction
The police may pull over a driver weaving
erratically on the highway on suspicion of drunkdriving. A police of ﬁcer must con ﬁrm this suspicion
by assessing whether the driver has a blood alcohol concentration over the “legal limit. ” The
“Breathalyzer ” test checks a person ’s breath
using a redox reaction to determine blood alcoholconcentration. This test was invented in 1953 byRobert Borkenstein, a former member of the IndianaState Police, and a professor of forensic studies.
What does a person ’s breath have to do with
the alcohol in his or her blood? In fact, there is adirect correlation between the concentration of alcohol in an exhaled breath and the concentrationof alcohol in the blood.
As blood moves through the lungs, it comes
in close contact with inhaled gases. If the blood contains alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the blood quickly reaches equilibrium with the concentration of alcohol in each inhaled breath.Thus, the alcohol content in an exhaled breath is ameasure of the alcohol concentration in the blooditself. For example, if a person has been drinkingalcohol, every 2100 mL of air exhaled contains about the same amount of alcohol as 1 mL of blood.
In the Breathalyzer test, the subject blows into a
tube connected to a vial. The exhaled air collects inthe vial, which already contains a mixture of sulfuricacid, potassium dichromate, water, and the catalystsilver nitrate. The alcohol reacts with the dichromateion in the following redox reaction.16H
+(aq)+2Cr 2O72−(aq)+3C2H5OH (/lscript)→
(orange) 4Cr3+(aq)+3C2H4O2(aq) +11H 2O(/lscript)
(green)
This reaction is accompanied by a visible colourchange, as orange dichromate ions become greenchromium(III) ions. The concentration of alcohol inthe blood is determined by measuring the intensityof the ﬁnal colour.
A recent modi ﬁcation of the Breathalyzer test
prevents drivers from starting their cars if they havebeen drinking. Alcohol ignition locks involve a typeof Breathalyzer test that is linked to the car ’s ignition
system. Until the driver passes the test, the car willnot start. This test is useful in regulating the drivinghabits of people who have been previously convictedof drinking and driving.
In the next investigation, you will carry out several redox reactions,
including reactions of acids with metals, and the combustion of hydrocarbons.27.Balance each of the following ionic equations for acidic conditions.

Specific Expectations  10.4
Chapter 10  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions • MHR 495The Oxidation Number Method
for Balancing Equations
In section 10.2, you learned that a redox reaction involves changes in
oxidation numbers. If an element undergoes oxidation, its oxidation number increases. If an element undergoes reduction, its oxidation number decreases. When balancing equations by the half-reaction methodin section 10.3, you sometimes used oxidation numbers to determine thereactant(s) and product(s) in each half-reaction.
In fact, you can use oxidation numbers to balance a chemical
equation by a new method. The oxidation number method is a method of balancing redox equations by ensuring that the total increase in the
oxidation numbers of the oxidized element(s) equals the total decrease in the oxidation numbers of the reduced element(s) .
For example, the combustion of ammonia in oxygen produces nitrogen
dioxide and water.
NH
3+O2→NO 2+H2O
−3+10 +4−2 +1−2
The oxidation number of nitrogen increases from −3 to +4, an increase
of 7. The oxidation number of oxygen decreases from 0 to −2, a decrease
of 2. The least common multiple of 7 and 2 is 14. In this case, two nitrogen atoms must react for every seven oxygen atoms so that the totalincrease and decrease in oxidation numbers both equal 14.

The following Sample Problem shows how these steps are applied.
Step 1 Write an unbalanced equation, if it is not given.
Step 2 Determine whether the reaction is a redox reaction by assigning an oxidation number to each element wherever itappears in the equation.
Step 3 If the reaction is a redox reaction, identify the element(s) thatundergo an increase in oxidation number and the element(s)that undergo a decrease in oxidation number.
Step 4 Find the numerical values of the increase and the decrease inoxidation numbers.
Step 5 Determine the smallest whole-number ratio of the oxidized andreduced elements so that the total increase in oxidation num-bers equals the total decrease in oxidation numbers.
Step 6 Use the smallest whole-number ratio to balance the numbers ofatoms of the element(s) oxidized and the element(s) reduced.

Write a balanced net ionic equation to show the formation of iodine by
bubbling oxygen gas through a basic solution that contains iodide ions.
Solution
Step 1 Write an unbalanced equation from the given information.
O2+I−→I2
Step 2 Assign oxidation numbers to see if it is a redox reaction.
O2+I−→I2
0 −10
Because iodide is oxidized to iodine, the reaction is a redox
reaction. Though the product that contains oxygen is unknown at this stage, oxygen must be reduced.
Step 3 Iodine is the element that undergoes an increase in oxidationnumber. Oxygen is the element that undergoes a decrease in oxidation number.
Step 4 Iodine undergoes an increase in its oxidation number from
−1 to 0, an increase of 1. Assume that the oxidation number of
oxygen after reduction is its normal value, that is, −2. Thus,
oxygen undergoes a decrease in its oxidation number from 0 to
−2, a decrease of 2.
Step 5 A 2:1 ratio of iodine atoms to oxygen atoms ensures that the totalincrease in oxidation numbers and the total decrease in oxidation numbers are both equal to 2. This is the smallest whole-number ratio.
Step 6 Use the ratio to balance the numbers of atoms of iodine and oxy-gen. Make sure there are two iodine atoms for every oxygen atom.

Batteries come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, from the tiny
button battery in a watch, to a large and heavy car battery. Although you probably use batteries every day, they may still surprise you. Forexample, did you know that you could make a battery from a lemon and two pieces of metal? To make a lemon battery, you could insert two different electrodes, such as copper and zinc strips, into a lemon. The battery can provide electricity for a practical use. For example, the battery can power a small light bulb, or turn a small motor.
For obvious reasons, lemon batteries are not a convenient way to
power a portable device, such as a cell phone. Scientists and inventorshave worked to develop a variety of batteries that are inexpensive, compact, and easy to store and to carry. Our society uses vast numbers of batteries.
What exactly is a battery, and how does it work? What is the
relationship between batteries and the redox reactions studied in Chapter 10? You will ﬁnd out the answers to these questions in this chapter.

Specific Expectations  11.1
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 505Galvanic Cells
You know that redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons from
one reactant to another. You may also recall that an electric current is
a ﬂow of electrons in a circuit. These two concepts form the basis of electrochemistry , which is the study of the processes involved in
converting chemical energy to electrical energy, and in converting electrical energy to chemical energy.
As you learned in Chapter 10, a zinc strip reacts with a solution
containing copper(II) ions, forming zinc ions and metallic copper. Thereaction is spontaneous. It releases energy in the form of heat; in otherwords, this reaction is exothermic.
Zn
(s)+Cu2+(aq)→Zn2+(aq)+Cu(s)
This reaction occurs on the surface of the zinc strip, where electrons
are transferred from zinc atoms to copper(II) ions when these atoms andions are in direct contact. A common technological invention called a galvanic cell uses redox reactions, such as the one described above, torelease energy in the form of electricity.
The Galvanic Cell
A galvanic cell , also called a voltaic cell , is a device that converts
chemical energy to electrical energy. The key to this invention is to prevent the reactants in a redox reaction from coming into direct contactwith each other. Instead, electrons ﬂow from one reactant to the otherthrough an external circuit , which is a circuit outside the reaction vessel.
This ﬂow of electrons through the external circuit is an electric current.
An Example of a Galvanic Cell: The Daniell Cell
Figure 11.1 shows one example of a galvanic cell, called the Daniell cell.
One half of the cell consists of a piece of zinc placed in a zinc sulfatesolution. The other half of the cell consists of a piece of copper placed in a copper(II) sulfate solution. A porous barrier , sometimes called a
semi-permeable membrane , separates these two half-cells. It stops the
copper(II) ions from coming into direct contact with the zinc electrode.
The Daniell cell
is named after its inventor, theEnglish chemist John FredericDaniell (1790–1845). In the photo-graph shown here, the zinc sulfatesolution is placed inside a porouscup, which is placed in a largercontainer of copper sulfate solution. The cup acts as theporous barrier.Figure 11.1
506 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryIn a Daniell cell, the pieces of metallic zinc and copper act as electrical
conductors. The conductors that carry electrons into and out of a cell are named electrodes . The zinc sulfate and copper(II) sulfate act as
electrolytes. Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when
dissolved in water. (The fact that a solution of an electrolyte conducts electricity does not mean that free electrons travel through the solution.An electrolyte solution conducts electricity because of ion movements,and the loss and gain of electrons at the electrodes.) The terms electrode
and electrolyte were invented by the leading pioneer of electrochemistry,
Michael Faraday (1791–1867).
The redox reaction takes place in a galvanic cell when an external
circuit, such as a metal wire, connects the electrodes. The oxidation half-reaction occurs in one half-cell, and the reduction half-reactionoccurs in the other half-cell. For the Daniell cell:
Oxidation (loss of electrons): Zn
(s)→Zn2+(aq)+2e−
Reduction (gain of electrons): Cu2+(aq)+2e−→Cu(s)
The electrode at which oxidation occurs is named the anode . In this
example, zinc atoms undergo oxidation at the zinc electrode. Thus, thezinc electrode is the anode of the Daniell cell. The electrode at whichreduction occurs is named the cathode . Here, copper(II) ions undergo
reduction at the copper electrode. Thus, the copper electrode is the cathode of the Daniell cell.
Free electrons cannot travel through the solution. Instead, the external
circuit conducts electrons from the anode to the cathode of a galvaniccell. Figure 11.2 gives a diagram of a typical galvanic cell.
At the anode of a galvanic cell, electrons are released by oxidation.
For example, at the zinc anode of the Daniell cell, zinc atoms release electrons to become positive zinc ions. Thus, the anode of a galvanic cell is negatively charged. Relative to the anode, the cathode of a galvaniccell is positively charged. In galvanic cells, electrons ﬂow through theexternal circuit from the negative electrode to the positive electrode.These electrode polarities may already be familiar to you. An example is shown in Figure 11.3.
Each half-cell contains a solution of a neutral compound. In a
Daniell cell, these solutions are aqueous zinc sulfate and aqueouscopper(II) sulfate. How can these electrolyte solutions remain neutralwhen electrons are leaving the anode of one half-cell and arriving at thecathode of the other half-cell? To maintain electrical neutrality in eachhalf-cell, some ions migrate through the porous barrier, as shown inFigure 11.4, on the next page. Negative ions (anions) migrate toward the anode, and positive ions (cations) migrate toward the cathode.anodee−e−

Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 507The separator between the half-cells does not need to be a porous barrier.
Figure 11.5 shows an alternative device. This device, called a salt bridge ,
contains an electrolyte solution that does not interfere in the reaction. The open ends of the salt bridge are plugged with a porous material, suchas glass wool, to stop the electrolyte from leaking out quickly. The plugsallow ion migration to maintain electrical neutrality.
Suppose the salt bridge of a Daniell cell contains ammonium chloride
solution, NH
4Cl(aq). As positive zinc ions are produced at the anode,
negative chloride ions migrate from the salt bridge into the half-cell thatcontains the anode. As positive copper(II) ions are removed from solutionat the cathode, positive ammonium ions migrate from the salt bridge intothe half-cell that contains the cathode.
Other electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate or potassium nitrate, could
be chosen for the salt bridge. Neither of these electrolytes interferes in thecell reaction. Silver nitrate, AgNO
3(aq), would be a poor choice for the salt
bridge, however. Positive silver ions would migrate into the half-cell thatcontains the cathode. Zinc displaces both copper and silver from solution,so both copper(II) ions and silver ions would be reduced at the cathode.The copper produced would be contaminated with silver.e−e−

508 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryGalvanic Cell Notation
A convenient shorthand method exists for representing galvanic cells. The
shorthand representation of a Daniell cell is as follows.
Zn|Zn2+||Cu2+|Cu
The phases or states may be included.
Zn(s)|Zn2+(aq)||Cu2+(aq)|Cu(s)
As you saw in Figure 11.4 and Figure 11.5, the anode may appear on the
left or on the right of a diagram. In the shorthand representation, however,
the anode is always shown on the left and the cathode on the right . Each
single vertical line, |, represents a phase boundary between the electrode
and the solution in a half-cell. For example, the ﬁrst single vertical lineshows that the solid zinc and aqueous zinc ions are in different phases orstates. The double vertical line, ||, represents the porous barrier or salt
bridge between the half-cells. Spectator ions are usually omitted.
Inert Electrodes
The zinc anode and copper cathode of a Daniell cell are both metals, and
can act as electrical conductors. However, some redox reactions involvesubstances that cannot act as electrodes, such as gases or dissolved electrolytes. Galvanic cells that involve such redox reactions use inertelectrodes. An inert electrode is an electrode made from a material that
is neither a reactant nor a product of the cell reaction. Figure 11.6 shows a cell that contains one inert electrode. The chemical equation, net ionicequation, and half-reactions for this cell are given below.
Chemical equation: Pb
(s)+2FeCl 3(aq)→2FeCl 2(aq) +PbCl 2(aq)
Net ionic equation: Pb(s)+2Fe3+(aq)→2Fe2+(aq)+Pb2+(aq)
Oxidation half-reaction: Pb(s)→Pb2+(aq)+2e−
Reduction half-reaction: Fe3+(aq)+e−→Fe2+(aq)
The reduction half-reaction does not include a solid conductor of
electrons, so an inert platinum electrode is used in this half-cell. The platinum electrode is chemically unchanged, so it does not appear in the chemical equation or half-reactions. However, it is included in theshorthand representation of the cell.
Pb|Pb

A comma separates the formulas Fe3+and Fe2+for the ions involved in the
reduction half-reaction. The formulas are not separated by a vertical line,because there is no phase boundary between these ions. The Fe

Introducing Cell Potentials
You know that water spontaneously ﬂows from a higher position to
a lower position. In other words, water ﬂows from a state of higher gravitational potential energy to a state of lower gravitational potentialenergy. As water ﬂows downhill, it can do work, such as turning a waterwheel or a turbine. The chemical changes that take place in galvanic cells are also accompanied by changes in potential energy. Electrons spontaneously ﬂow from a position of higher potential energy at theanode to a position of lower potential energy at the cathode. The movingelectrons can do work, such as lighting a bulb or turning a motor.
The difference between the potential energy at the anode and the
potential energy at the cathode is the electric potential , E, of a cell. The
unit used to measure electric potential is called the volt, with symbol V.
Because of the name of this unit, electric potential is more commonlyknown as cell voltage . Another name for it is cell potential . A cell
potential can be measured using an electrical device called a voltmeter.
A cell potential of 0 V means that the cell has no electric potential,
and no electrons will ﬂow. You know that you can generate electricity by connecting a zinc electrode and a copper electrode that have beeninserted into a lemon. However, you cannot generate electricity by connecting two copper electrodes that have been inserted into the lemon.The two copper electrodes are the same and are in contact with the sameelectrolyte. There is no potential difference between the two electrodes.
Electric potentials vary from one cell to another, depending on various
factors. You will examine some of these factors in the next investigation.The cell voltage is sometimes
called the electromotive force ,
abbreviated emf. However,
this term can be misleading. A cell voltage is a potential difference, not a force. Theunit of cell voltage, the volt, is not a unit of force.

512 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryDisposable Batteries
The Daniell cell is fairly large and full of liquid. Realistically, you could
not use this type of cell to power a wristwatch, a remote control, or aﬂashlight. Galvanic cells have been modiﬁed, however, to make themmore useful.
The Dry Cell Battery
A dry cell is a galvanic cell with the electrolyte contained in a paste
thickened with starch. This cell is much more portable than the Daniellcell. The ﬁrst dry cell, invented by the French chemist Georges Leclanchéin 1866, was called the Leclanché cell.
Modern dry cells are closely modelled on the Leclanché cell, and also
contain electrolyte pastes. You have probably used dry cells in all kinds ofapplications, such as lighting a ﬂashlight, powering a remote control, orringing a doorbell. Dry cells are inexpensive. The cheapest AAA-, AA-, C-,and D-size 1.5-V batteries are dry cells.
A battery is deﬁned as a set of galvanic cells connected in series. The
negative electrode of one cell is connected to the positive electrode of thenext cell in the set. The voltage of a set of cells connected in series is the
sum of the voltages of the individual cells . Thus, a 9-V battery contains
six 1.5-V dry cells connected in series. Often, the term “battery” is alsoused to describe a single cell. For example, a 1.5-V dry cell battery contains only a single cell.
A dry cell battery stops producing electricity when the reactants
are used up. This type of battery is disposable after it has run down completely. A disposable battery is known as a primary battery . Some
other batteries are rechargeable. A rechargeable battery is known as a secondary battery . The rest of this section will deal with primary
batteries. You will learn about secondary batteries in section 11.3.
A dry cell contains a zinc anode and an inert graphite cathode, as
shown in Figure 11.7. The electrolyte is a moist paste of manganese(IV)oxide, MnO
2, zinc chloride, ZnCl 2, ammonium chloride, NH 4Cl, and
“carbon black,” C(s), also known as soot.
The oxidation half-reaction at the zinc anode is already familiar to you.
Zn(s)→Zn2+(aq)+2e−
The reduction half-reaction at the cathode is more complicated. An
approximation is given here.
2MnO 2(s)+H2O(/lscript)+2e−→Mn 2O3(s)+2OH−(aq)
Therefore, an approximation of the overall cell reaction is:
2MnO 2(s)+Zn(s)+H2O(/lscript)→Mn 2O3(s)+Zn2+(aq)+2OH−(aq)

Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 513The Alkaline Cell Battery
The more expensive alkaline cell, shown in Figure 11.8, is an improved,
longer-lasting version of the dry cell.
The structure of an alkaline cell is similar to the structure of a dry cell.
Each type has a voltage of 1.5 V.
Billions of alkaline batteries, each containing a single alkaline cell, are
made every year. The ammonium chloride and zinc chloride used in a drycell are replaced by strongly alkaline (basic) potassium hydroxide, KOH.The half-reactions and the overall reaction in an alkaline cell are given here.

Overall cell reaction: Zn(s)+MnO 2(s)+H2O(/lscript)→ZnO (s)+Mn(OH) 2(s)
The Button Cell Battery
A button battery is much smaller than an alkaline battery. Button batteries
are commonly used in watches, as shown in Figure 11.9. Because of itssmall size, the button battery is also used for hearing aids, pacemakers, andsome calculators and cameras. The development of smaller batteries hashad an enormous impact on portable devices, as shown in Figure 11.10.
Two common types of button batteries both use a zinc container,
which acts as the anode, and an inert stainless steel cathode, as shown inFigure 11.11 on the next page. In the mercury button battery, the alkalineelectrolyte paste contains mercury(II) oxide, HgO. In the silver button battery, the electrolyte paste contains silver oxide, Ag
2O. The batteries
have similar voltages: about 1.3 V for the mercury cell, and about 1.6 V for the silver cell.
The reaction products in a mercury button battery are solid zinc oxide
and liquid mercury. The two half-reactions and the overall equation are as follows.
Oxidation half-reaction: Zn
(s)+2OH−(aq)→ZnO (s)+H2O(/lscript)+2e−
Reduction half-reaction: HgO (s)+H2O(/lscript)+2e−→Hg(/lscript)+2OH−(aq)

Careers in Chemistry
Explosives Chemist
Fortunato Villamagna works as the vice-president of
technology for an Australian-owned company withofﬁces worldwide, including Canada. Villamagna ’s
job has given him the opportunity to invent newproducts, build chemical plants, and conduct projects in Africa and Australia.
Born in Italy, Villamagna moved to Canada
when he was eight. He grew up in Montr éal, where
his interest in chemistry was sparked by a Grade 10teacher.
At university, Villamagna gained a greater
understanding of the value of chemistry research.“Research creates new technologies and concepts,
results in new products and services, creates jobsand prosperity, and in the end improves people ’s
lives, ” he says. Villamagna decided to pursue
graduate studies. He obtained a Masters of Sciencein physical chemistry at Concordia University, and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry at McGill University.Today, Villamagna leads a team of researchersresponsible for developing new products and techniques involving explosives.Redox reactions play an important role in
industrial safety. Explosives are used in controlledways in the mining, highway, and constructionindustries. The use of explosives allows modernworkers to break up bedrock and carry out necessary demolitions from a safe distance.Chemists are involved in the development and production of explosives. They are also involved in making recommendations for the safe handlingand disposal of explosives.
Many explosives are based on redox reactions.
For example, the decomposition of nitroglycerin into nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, andoxygen is a redox reaction that results in a powerfulexplosion. The three nitrate groups of a nitroglycerinmolecule act as powerful oxidizing agents, and theglycerol portion of the compound acts as a fuel.Fuels are very easily oxidized.
Nitroglycerin is highly unstable and can
explode very easily. Therefore, it is dif ﬁcult to
manufacture and transport safely. Ammoniumnitrate, an explosive that can act as both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent, is often usedto modify other explosives such as nitroglycerin.Ammonium nitrate is one of the products made by Villamagna ’s company.

Specific Expectations  Standard Cell Potentials
In section 11.1, you learned that a cell potential is the difference between
the potential energies at the anode and the cathode of a cell. In otherwords, a cell potential is the difference between the potentials of two half-cells. You cannot measure the potential of one half-cell, because asingle half-reaction cannot occur alone. However, you can use measuredcell potentials to construct tables of half-cell potentials. A table of standard half-cell potentials allows you to calculate cell potentials, rather than building the cells and measuring their potentials. Table 11.1 includesa few standard half-cell potentials. A larger table of standard half-cellpotentials is given in Appendix E.
Table 11.1 Standard Half-Cell Potentials (298 K)
Table 11.1 and the larger table in Appendix E are based on the following
conventions.
•Each half-reaction is written as a reduction. The half-cell potential
for a reduction half-reaction is called a reduction potential . Look at
the molecules and ions on the left side of each half-reaction. The mosteasily reduced molecules and ions (best oxidizing agents), such as F
2,
MnO 4−, and O2, are near the top of the list. The least easily reduced
molecules and ions (worst oxidizing agents), such as Na+, Ca2+, and
H2O, are near the bottom of the list.
•The numerical values of cell potentials and half-cell potentials depend
on various conditions, so tables of standard reduction potentials are true
when ions and molecules are in their standard states . These standard
states are the same as for tables of standard enthalpy changes. Aqueousmolecules and ions have a standard concentration of 1 mol/L. Gases havea standard pressure of 101.3 kPa or 1 atm. The standard temperature is 25˚C or 298 K. Standard reduction potentials are designated by thesymbol E˚, where the superscript ˚ indicates standard states.
•Because you can measure potential differences, but not individual
reduction potentials, all values in the table are relative. Each half-cellreduction potential is given relative to the reduction potential of thestandard hydrogen electrode, which has been assigned a value of zero.The design of this electrode is shown in Figure 11.12.Half-reaction

Calculating Standard Cell Potentials
You can use Table 11.1 to calculate the standard cell potential of the
familiar Daniell cell. This cell has its standard potential when the solution concentrations are 1 mol/L, as shown in the shorthand representation below.
Zn|Zn
2+(1 mol/L) ||Cu2+(1 mol/L) |Cu
One method to calculate the standard cell potential is to subtract the
standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reductionpotential of the cathode.
For a Daniell cell, you know that copper is the cathode and zinc is the
anode. The relevant half-reactions and standard reduction potentials fromTable 11.1 are as follows.
Cu
2+(aq)+2e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfCu(s)E˚=0.342 V
Zn2+(aq)+2e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfZn(s)E˚=−0.762 V
Use these values to calculate the cell potential.
E˚cell=E˚cathode −E˚anode
=0.342 V −(−0.762 V)
=0.342 V +0.762 V
=1.104 V
Thus, the standard cell potential for a Daniell cell is 1.104 V.
The standard cell potentials of all galvanic cells have positive values ,

518 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryThis calculation of the standard cell potential for the Daniell cell used
the mathematical concept that the subtraction of a negative number isequivalent to the addition of its positive value. You saw that
0.342 V −(−0.762 V) =0.342 V +0.762 V
In other words, the subtraction of the reduction potential for a
half-reaction is equivalent to the addition of the potential for the reverse
half-reaction. The reverse half-reaction of a reduction is an oxidation. The half-cell potential for an oxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation
potential . If the reduction half-reaction is as follows,
Zn
2+(aq)+2e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfZn(s)E˚=−0.762 V
then the oxidation half-reaction is
Zn(s)/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfZn2+(aq)+2e−E˚ox=+0.762 V
To summarize, the standard cell potential can also be calculated as the
sum of a standard reduction potential and a standard oxidation potential.
As shown above, you can obtain the standard oxidation potential from
a table of standard reduction potentials by reversing the reduction half-reaction, and changing the sign of the relevant potential. The reductionand oxidation half-reactions for the previous example are as follows.

The calculation of the standard cell potential using these standard
half-reaction potentials is as follows.
E˚cell=E˚red+E˚ox

Finding the difference between two reduction potentials, and ﬁnding
the sum of a reduction potential and an oxidation potential are exactlyequivalent methods for ﬁnding a cell potential. Use whichever method
you prefer. The ﬁrst Sample Problem includes both methods for ﬁnding

522 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistrySection Summary
In this section, you learned that you can calculate cell potentials by
using tables of half-cell potentials. The half-cell potential for a reductionhalf-reaction is called a reduction potential. The half-cell potential for anoxidation half-reaction is called an oxidation potential. Standard half-cellpotentials are written as reduction potentials. The values of standardreduction potentials for half-reactions are relative to the reduction potentialof the standard hydrogen electrode. You used standard reduction potentialsto calculate standard cell potentials for galvanic cells. You learned twomethods of calculating standard cell potentials. One method is to subtractthe standard reduction potential of the anode from the standard reductionpotential of the cathode. The other method is to add the standard reductionpotential of the cathode and the standard oxidation potential of the anode.In the next section, you will learn about a different type of cell, called anelectrolytic cell.Many scales of measurement have zero values that
are arbitrary. For example, on Earth, average sealevel is often assigned as the zero of altitude. In thisThoughtLab, you will investigate what happens tocalculated cell potentials when the reference half-cellis changed.

Specific Expectations  Electrolytic Cells
For a galvanic cell, you have learned that the overall reaction is
spontaneous, and that the cell potential has a positive value. A galvaniccell converts chemical energy to electrical energy. Electrons ﬂow from a
higher potential energy to a lower potential energy. As described earlier,the ﬂow of electrons in the external circuit of a galvanic cell can be
compared to water ﬂowing downhill.
Although water ﬂows downhill spontaneously, you can also pump
water uphill. This process requires energy because it moves water from a position of lower potential energy to a position of higher potential energy. You will now learn about a type of cell that uses energy to moveelectrons from lower potential energy to higher potential energy. This type of cell, called an electrolytic cell , is a device that converts electrical
energy to chemical energy. The process that takes place in an electrolyticcell is called electrolysis . The overall reaction in an electrolytic cell is
non-spontaneous, and requires energy to occur. This type of reaction isthe reverse of a spontaneous reaction, which generates energy when it occurs.
Like a galvanic cell, an electrolytic cell includes electrodes, at least
one electrolyte, and an external circuit. Unlike galvanic cells, electrolyticcells require an external source of electricity, sometimes called the external voltage . This is included in the external circuit. Except for the
external source of electricity, an electrolytic cell may look just like a galvanic cell. Some electrolytic cells include a porous barrier or saltbridge. In other electrolytic cells, the two half-reactions are not separated,and take place in the same container.
Electrolysis of Molten Salts
The electrolytic cell shown in Figure 11.14 decomposes sodium chlorideinto its elements. The cell consists of a single container with two inertelectrodes dipping into liquid sodium chloride. To melt the sodium chloride, the temperature must be above its melting point of about 800 ˚C.
As in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride, the ions in molten sodiumchloride have some freedom of movement. In other words, molten sodiumchloride is the electrolyte of this cell.

Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 525The external source of electricity forces electrons onto one electrode. As a
result, this electrode becomes negative relative to the other electrode. Thepositive sodium ions move toward the negative electrode, where they gainelectrons and are reduced to the element sodium. At this temperature,sodium metal is produced as a liquid. The negative chloride ions movetoward the positive electrode, where they lose electrons and are oxidizedto the element chlorine, a gas. As in a galvanic cell, reduction occurs at
the cathode, and oxidation occurs at the anode of an electrolytic cell . The
half-reactions for this electrolytic cell are as follows.
Reduction half-reaction (occurs at the cathode): Na
+(/lscript)+e−→Na(/lscript)
Oxidation half-reaction (occurs at the anode): 2Cl−(/lscript)→Cl2(g)+2e−
Because of the external voltage of the electrolytic cell, the electrodes
do not have the same polarities in electrolytic and galvanic cells. In a galvanic cell, the cathode is positive and the anode is negative. In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positive and the cathode is negative.
The electrolysis of molten sodium chloride is an important industrial
reaction. Figure 11.15 shows the large electrolytic cell used in the industrial production of sodium and chlorine. You will meet other industrial electrolytic processes later in this chapter.

The electrolysis of aqueous solutions may not yield the desired products.
Sir Humphry Davy (1778 –1829) discovered the elements sodium and
potassium by electrolyzing their molten salts. Before this discovery, Davyhad electrolyzed aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium salts. He had not succeeded in reducing the metal ions to the pure metals at thecathode. Instead, his ﬁrst experiments had produced hydrogen gas. Where
did the hydrogen gas come from?
When electrolyzing an aqueous solution, there are two compounds
present: water, and the dissolved electrolyte. Water may be electrolyzed as well as, or instead of, the electrolyte. The electrolysis of water producesoxygen gas and hydrogen gas, as shown in Figure 11.16.

Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 527The half-reactions for the electrolysis of water are given below.
Oxidation half-reaction (occurs at the anode):
2H2O(/lscript)→O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e−
Reduction half-reaction (occurs at the cathode):
2H2O(/lscript)+2e−→H2(g)+2OH−(aq)
Because the number of electrons lost and gained must be equal, multiply
the reduction half-reaction by 2. Then add and simplify to obtain theoverall cell reaction.
Overall cell reaction: 2H
2O(/lscript)→2H2(g)+O2(g)
The standard reduction potentials are as follows.
O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2H2O(/lscript)E˚=1.229 V
2H2O(/lscript)+2e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfH2(g)+2OH−(aq) E˚=−0.828 V
You can use these values to calculate the E˚cellvalue for the
decomposition of water.
E˚cell=E˚cathode −E˚anode
=−0.828 V −1.229 V
=−2.057 V
Therefore,
2H2O(/lscript)→2H2(g)+O2(g) E˚cell=−2.057 V
The negative cell potential shows that the reaction is not spontaneous.
Electrolytic cells are used for non-spontaneous redox reactions, so all
electrolytic cells have negative cell potentials .
The standard reduction potentials used to calculate E˚cellfor the
decomposition of water apply only to reactants and products in their standard states. However, in pure water at 25 ˚C, the hydrogen ions and
hydroxide ions each have concentrations of 1×10
−7mol/L . This is not
the standard state value of 1 mol/L. The reduction potential values for the non-standard conditions in pure water are given below. The super-script zero is now omitted from the Esymbol, because the values are no
longer standard.
Using these new half-cell potentials, E
cellfor the decomposition of
pure water at 25 ˚C by electrolysis has a calculated value of −1.229 V.
Therefore, the calculated value of the external voltage needed is 1.229.
In practice, the external voltage needed for an electrolytic cell is
always greater than the calculated value, especially for reactions involvinggases. Therefore, the actual voltage needed to electrolyze pure water isgreater than 1.229 V. The excess voltage required above the calculated
value is called the overvoltage . Overvoltages depend on the gases
involved and on the materials in the electrodes.
When electrolyzing water, there is another practical dif ﬁculty to
consider. Pure water is a very poor electrical conductor. To increase theconductivity, an electrolyte that does not interfere in the reaction is addedto the water.O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf2H2O(/lscript)E=0.815 V

528 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryElectrolysis of Aqueous Solutions
As stated previously, an electrolytic cell may have the same design as a
galvanic cell, except for the external source of electricity. Consider, forexample, the familiar Daniell cell. (This cell was described in section 11.1and shown in Figure 11.5.) By adding an external electrical supply, with avoltage greater than the voltage of the Daniell cell, you can push electronsin the opposite direction. By pushing electrons in the opposite direction,you reverse the chemical reaction. Figure 11.17 shows both cells, whiletheir properties are compared in Table 11.2.
Adding an external voltage to reverse the electron ﬂow converts a Daniell cell
from a galvanic cell into an electrolytic cell. The result is to switch the anode and cathode.
In the galvanic cell, the zinc anode gradually dissolves. The copper
cathode grows as more copper is deposited onto it. In the electrolytic cell,the copper anode gradually dissolves. The zinc cathode grows as morezinc is deposited onto it. The process in which a metal is deposited, orplated, onto the cathode in an electrolytic cell is known as electroplating .
Electroplating is very important in industry, as you will learn later in this chapter.Galvanic Cell Electrolytic Cell

Electrolysis of an Aqueous Solution
Continued ...Predicting the Products of Electrolysis for an Aqueous Solution
The comparison of the Daniell cell with the electrolytic version of the cell
appears straightforward. One reaction is the reverse of the other. However,you have just learned that the electrolysis of an aqueous solution mayinvolve the electrolysis of water. How can you predict the actual productsfor this type of electrolysis reaction?
To predict the products of an electrolysis involving an aqueous
solution, you must examine all possible half-reactions and their reductionpotentials. Then, you must ﬁnd the overall reaction that requires the
lowest external voltage. That is, you must ﬁnd the overall cell reaction
with a negative cell potential that is closest to zero. The next SampleProblem shows you how to predict the products of the electrolysis of an aqueous solution.
In practice, reaction products are sometimes different from the
products predicted, using the method described here. Predictions are leastreliable when the reduction potentials are close together, especially whengaseous products are expected. However, there are many cases in whichthe predictions are correct.

You know that galvanic cells have positive standard cell potentials, and
that these cells use spontaneous chemical reactions to produce electricity.You also know that electrolytic cells have negative standard cell potentials,and that these cells use electricity to perform non-spontaneous chemicalreactions. Thus, you can use the sign of the standard cell potential to pre-dict whether a reaction is spontaneous or not under standard conditions.

Predicting Spontaneity
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 535Rechargeable Batteries
In section 11.1, you learned about several primary (disposable)
batteries that contain galvanic cells. One of the most common secondary(rechargeable) batteries is found in car engines. Most cars contain a lead-acid battery, shown in Figure 11.18. When you turn the ignition, a surge of electricity from the battery starts the motor.
When in use, a lead-acid battery partially discharges. In other words,
the cells in the battery operate as galvanic cells, and produce electricity.The reaction in each cell proceeds spontaneously in one direction. Torecharge the battery, a generator driven by the car engine supplies electricity to the battery. The external voltage of the generator reverses the reaction in the cells. The reaction in each cell now proceeds non-spontaneously, and the cells operate as electrolytic cells. All secondary batteries, including the lead-acid battery, operate some of the time as galvanic cells, and some of the time as electrolytic cells.
As the name suggests, the materials used in a lead-acid battery
include lead and an acid. Figure 11.19 shows that the electrodes in eachcell are constructed using lead grids. One electrode consists of powderedlead packed into one grid. The other electrode consists of powderedlead(IV) oxide packed into the other grid. The electrolyte solution is fairly concentrated sulfuric acid, at about 4.5 mol/L.

536 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryWhen the battery supplies electricity, the half-reactions and overall cell
reaction are as follows.
Oxidation (at the Pb anode): Pb(s)+SO42−(aq)→PbSO 4(s)+2e−
Reduction (at the PbO 2cathode):
PbO 2(s)+4H+(aq)+SO42−(aq)+2e−→PbSO 4(s)+2H2O(/lscript)
Overall cell reaction:
Pb(s)+PbO 2(s)+4H+(aq)+2SO 42−(aq)→2PbSO 4(s)+2H2O(/lscript)
You can see that the reaction consumes some of the lead in the anode,
some of the lead(IV) oxide in the cathode, and some of the sulfuric acid. A precipitate of lead(II) sulfate forms.
When the battery is recharged, the half-reactions and the overall cell
reaction are reversed. In this reverse reaction, lead and lead(IV) oxide areredeposited in their original locations, and sulfuric acid is re-formed.
Reduction (at the Pb cathode): PbSO
4(s)+2e−→Pb(s)+SO42−(aq)
Oxidation (at the PbO 2anode):
PbSO 4(s)+2H2O(/lscript)→PbO 2(s)+4H+(aq)+SO42−(aq)+2e−
Overall cell reaction:
2PbSO 4(s)+2H2O(/lscript)→Pb(s)+PbO 2(s)+4H+(aq)+2SO 42−(aq)
In practice, this reversibility is not perfect. However, the battery can go
through many charge/discharge cycles before it eventually wears out.
Many types of rechargeable batteries are much more portable than a car
battery. For example, there is now a rechargeable version of the alkalinebattery. Another example, shown in Figure 11.20, is the rechargeable nickel-cadmium (nicad) battery. Figure 11.21 shows a nickel-cadmium cell,which has a potential of about 1.4 V. A typical nicad battery contains threecells in series to produce a suitable voltage for electronic devices. Whenthe cells in a nicad battery operate as galvanic cells, the half-reactions andthe overall cell reaction are as follows.
Oxidation (at the Cd anode): Cd
(s)+2OH−(aq)→Cd(OH) 2(s)+2e−
Reduction (at the NiO(OH) cathode):
NiO(OH) (s)+H2O(/lscript)+e−→Ni(OH) 2(s)+OH−(aq)
Overall cell reaction:
Cd(s)+2NiO(OH) (s)+2H2O(/lscript)→Cd(OH) 2(s)+2Ni(OH) 2(s)
Like many technological innovations, nickel-cadmium batteries carry risks
as well as bene ﬁts. After being discharged repeatedly, they eventually
wear out. In theory, worn-out nicad batteries should be recycled. In practice, however, many end up in garbage dumps. Over time, discardednicad batteries release toxic cadmium. The toxicity of this substancemakes it hazardous to the environment, as cadmium can enter the foodchain. Long-term exposure to low levels of cadmium can have seriousmedical effects on humans, such as high blood pressure and heart disease.
Billions of
rechargeable nicad batteries are produced every year. They are used in portable devices suchas cordless razors and cordlesspower tools.Figure 11.20

Specific Expectations  Faraday’s Law
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Michael Faraday (1791 –1867) was
the leading pioneer of electrochemistry. One of Faraday ’s major contribu-
tions was to connect the concepts of stoichiometry and electrochemistry.
A depiction of Faraday ’s laboratory.
You know that a balanced equation represents relationships between
the quantities of reactants and products. For a reaction that takes place in a cell, stoichiometric calculations can also include the quantity of electricity produced or consumed. Stoichiometric calculations in electro-chemistry make use of a familiar unit —the mole.
As a ﬁrst step, you need information about measurements in
electricity. You know that the ﬂow of electrons through an external circuit
is called the electric current . It is measured in a unit called the ampere
(symbol A), named after the French physicist Andr é Amp ère (1775 –1836).
The quantity of electricity , also known as the electric charge , is the
product of the current ﬂowing through a circuit and the time for which it
ﬂows. The quantity of electricity is measured in a unit called the coulomb
(symbol C). This unit is named after another French physicist, CharlesCoulomb (1736 –1806). The ampere and the coulomb are related, in that
one coulomb is the quantity of electricity that ﬂows through a circuit inone second if the current is one ampere . This relationship can be written
mathematically.
For example, suppose a current of 2.00 A ﬂows for 5.00 min. You can use
this information to ﬁnd the quantity of electricity, in coulombs.
5.00 min =300 s
2.00 A ×300 s =600 C , or 6.00 ×10
2Ccharge (in coulombs) =current (in amperes) ×time (in seconds)Figure 11.22
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 539For stoichiometric calculations, you also need to know the electric charge
on a mole of electrons. This charge can be calculated by multiplying the charge on one electron and the number of electrons in one mole(Avogadro ’s number). The charge on a mole of electrons is known as
one faraday (1 F), named after Michael Faraday.
Charge on one mole of electrons =1.602 ×10
−19C
1e− ×6.022 ×1023e−
1 mol
=9.647 ×104C/mol
A rounded value of 96 500 C/mol is often used in calculations. Note that
this rounded value has three signi ﬁcant digits.
The information you have just learned permits a very precise
control of electrolysis. For example, suppose you modify a Daniell cell to operate as an electrolytic cell. You want to plate 0.1 mol of zinc ontothe zinc electrode. The coef ﬁcients in the half-reaction for the reduction
represent stoichiometric relationships. Figure 11.23 shows that two moles of electrons are needed for each mole of zinc deposited. Therefore,to deposit 0.1 mol of zinc, you need to use 0.2 mol of electrons.
0.1 mol Zn ×2 mol e

1 mol Zn=0.2 mol e−
A balanced half-reaction shows relationships between the amounts of
reactants and products and the amount of electrons transferred.
In the next Sample Problem, you will learn to apply the relationship
between the amount of electrons and the amount of an electrolysis product.Figure 11.231 ion

Step 2 From the quantity of electricity, ﬁnd the amount of electrons

Step 3 Use the stoichiometry of the relevant half-reaction to relate the amount of electrons to the amount of aluminum produced.
Step 4 Use the molar mass of aluminum to convert the amount of aluminum to a mass.
Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 To calculate the quantity of electricity in coulombs, work inamperes and seconds.
1000 mA =1A

=0.500 A
1.50 h =1.50 h ×60 min

=5400 s, or 5.40 ×103s
Quantity of electricity =0.500 A ×5400 s
=2700 C, or 2.70 ×103C
Step 2 Find the amount of electrons. One mole of electrons has a charge
of 96 500 C.
Amount of electrons =2700 C ×1 mol e−
96500 C
=0.0280 mol e−
Step 3 The half-reaction for the reduction of aluminum ions to aluminum
is Al3++3e−→Al.
Amount of aluminum formed =0.0280 mol e−×1 mol Al
3 mol e−
=0.00933 mol Al
Step 4 Convert the amount of aluminum to a mass.
Mass of Al formed =0.00933 mol Al ×27.0 g Al
1 mol Al
=0.252 g
Check Your Solution
The answer is expressed in units of mass. To check your answer, use
estimation. If the current were 1 A, then 1 mol of electrons would pass in 96 500 s. In this example, the current is less than 1 A, and the time ismuch less than 96 500 s. Therefore, much less than 1 mol of electronswould be used, and much less than 1 mol (27 g) of aluminum would be formed.Continued ...

(b)Explain why you do not need to know the electric current or the

The preceding Sample Problem gave an example of the mathematical use
of Faraday ’s law. Faraday’s law states that the amount of a substance
produced or consumed in an electrolysis reaction is directly proportionalto the quantity of electricity that ﬂows through the circuit .
To illustrate this statement, think about changing the quantity of
electricity used in the Sample Problem. Suppose this quantity were doubled by using the same current, 500 mA, for twice the time, 3 h. As a result, the amount of electrons passing into the cell would also bedoubled.
500 mA =0.500 A
3h=2×1.5 h
=2×5400 s
Quantity of electricity =0.500 A ×(2×5400 s)

Amount of electrons =5400 C ×1 mol e−

Then, as you can see from the relevant half-reaction, the mass of
aluminum produced would be doubled. The mass of aluminum producedis clearly proportional to the quantity of electricity used.

The alloy used
to make pop cans contains about97% aluminum, by mass. The otherelements in the alloy are magnesium, manganese, iron, silicon, and copper.Figure 11.24Industrial Extraction and Re ﬁning of Metals
Many metals, and their alloys, are widely used in modern society. The
enormous variety of metal objects ranges from large vehicles, such as carsand aircraft, to small items, such as the pop cans shown in Figure 11.24.
Extraction is a process by which a metal is obtained from an ore.
Some metals are extracted in electrolytic cells. In section 11.3, you sawthe extraction of sodium from molten sodium chloride in a Downs cell.Other reactive metals, including lithium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium,and radium, are also extracted industrially by the electrolysis of theirmolten chlorides.
One of the most important electrolytic processes is the extraction
of aluminum from an ore called bauxite. This ore is mainly composed of hydrated aluminum oxide, Al
2O3•xH2O. (The “x” in the formula
indicates that the number of water molecules per formula unit is variable.)In industry, the scale of production of metals is huge. The electrolytic production of aluminum is over two million tonnes per year in Canadaalone. As you know from Faraday ’s law, the amount of a metal produced
by electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity used.Therefore, the industrial extraction of aluminum and other metals by electrolysis requires vast quantities of electricity. The availability and cost of electricity greatly in ﬂuence the location of industrial plants.
In industry, the process of purifying a material is known as reﬁning .
After the extraction stage, some metals are re ﬁned in electrolytic cells.
For example, copper is about 99% pure after extraction. This copper is pure enough for some uses, such as the manufacture of copper pipes for plumbing. However, the copper is not pure enough for one of its principal uses, electrical wiring. Therefore, some of the impure copper isreﬁned electrolytically, as shown in Figure 11.25. Nickel can be re ﬁned
electrolytically in a similar way. You re ﬁned copper on a small scale in
Investigation 11-C.
This electrolytic cell is used to re ﬁne copper. The anode is impure copper,
and the cathode is pure copper. During electrolysis, the impure copper anode dissolves, andpure copper is plated onto the cathode. The resulting cathode is 99.99% pure metal. Mostimpurities that were present in the anode either remain in solution or fall to the bottom of the cell as a sludge.Figure 11.25
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 545Section Summary
In this section, you learned how stoichiometry relates the quantities
of reactants and products to the quantity of electricity consumed in anelectrolytic cell. You used Faraday ’s law to solve problems relating to
electrolysis. You also learned that the extraction and re ﬁning of some
metals are carried out electrolytically. In the next section, you will see several other important applications of electrochemistry to modern society.
In Section 10.3, you learned about a redox reaction used in the
production of compact discs. In another step of this productionprocess, nickel is electroplated onto the silver-coated master disc. The nickel layer is removed and used to make pressings of the CD onto plastic discs. The plastic pressings are then coated with aluminum to make the ﬁnished CDs.
(a)When nickel is plated onto the silver master disc, is the master
disc the anode or the cathode of the cell? Explain.
(b)Calculate the quantity of electricity needed to plate each gram ofnickel onto the master disc. Assume that the plating processinvolves the reduction of nickel(II) ions.
Most industrial reactions take place on a much larger scale than
reactions in a laboratory or classroom. The voltage used in a Downscell for the industrial electrolysis of molten sodium chloride is notvery high, about 7 V to 8 V. However, the current used is 25 000 A to 40 000 A. Assuming a current of 3.0×10
4A, determine the mass
of sodium and the mass of chlorine made in 24 h in one Downs cell.Express your answers in kilograms.
An industrial cell that puri ﬁes copper by electrolysis operates at
2.00 ×10
2A. Calculate the mass, in tonnes, of pure copper produced
if the cell is supplied with raw materials whenever necessary, and if it works continuously for a year that is not a leap year.
Canada is a major producer of aluminum by the electrolysis of
bauxite. However, there are no bauxite mines in Canada, and all theore must be imported. Explain why aluminum is produced in Canada.
Research the extraction of aluminum by the electrolysis of
bauxite. Write a report on your ﬁndings. Include a description of the
electrolytic cell and how it operates. Indicate where aluminum is produced in Canada. Also include any environmental concerns associated with aluminum production by electrolysis.
Nickel and copper are both very important to the Ontario
economy. Before they can be re ﬁned by electrolysis, they must be
extracted from their ores. Both metals can be extracted from a sul ﬁde
ore, NiS or Cu
2S. The sul ﬁde is roasted to form an oxide, and then the
oxide is reduced to the metal. Research the extraction processes forboth nickel and copper, and write balanced equations for the redoxreactions involved. One product of each extraction process is sulfurdioxide. Research the environmental effects of this compound.Describe any steps taken to decrease these effects.MC6MC5MC4I 3I 2I 1Section Review

Specific Expectations  Issues Involving Electrochemistry
You have probably seen many examples of rusty objects, such as the one
in Figure 11.26. However, you may not realize that rusting costs many billions of dollars per year in prevention, maintenance, and replacementcosts. You will now learn more about rusting and about other issuesinvolving electrochemistry.
Rust is a common sight on iron objects.
Corrosion
Rusting is an example of corrosion , which is a spontaneous redox
reaction of materials with substances in their environment. Figure 11.27shows an example of the hazards that result from corrosion.
Many metals are fairly easily oxidized. The atmosphere contains a
powerful oxidizing agent: oxygen. Because metals are constantly in contact with oxygen, they are vulnerable to corrosion. In fact, the term“corrosion ” is sometimes de ﬁned as the oxidation of metals exposed
to the environment. In North America, about 20% to 25% of iron andsteel production is used to replace objects that have been damaged ordestroyed by corrosion. However, not all corrosion is harmful. For example, the green layer formed by the corrosion of a copper roof is considered attractive by many people.
Figure 11.26
On April 28, 1988,
this Aloha Airlines aircraft was ﬂying at an altitude of 7300 m when
a large part of the upper fuselageripped off. This accident wascaused by undetected corrosiondamage. The pilot showed tremen-dous skill in landing the plane.Figure 11.27
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 547Rust is a hydrated iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3•xH2O. The electrochemical
formation of rust occurs in small galvanic cells on the surface of a piece of iron, as shown in Figure 11.28. In each small cell, iron acts as theanode. The cathode is inert, and may be an impurity that exists in the ironor is deposited onto it. For example, the cathode could be a piece of sootthat has been deposited onto the iron surface from the air.
Water, in the form of rain, is needed for rusting to occur. Carbon
dioxide in the air dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, H
2CO3(aq).
This weak acid partially dissociates into ions. Thus, the carbonic acid isan electrolyte for the corrosion process. Other electrolytes, such as roadsalt, may also be involved. The circuit is completed by the iron itself,which conducts electrons from the anode to the cathode.
The rusting of iron involves the reaction of iron, oxygen, and water in a
naturally occurring galvanic cell on the exposed surface of the metal. There may be many of these small cells on the surface of the same piece of iron.
The rusting process is complex, and the equations may be written in
various ways. A simpli ﬁed description of the half-reactions and the
overall cell reaction is given here.
Oxidation half-reaction (occurs at the anode):
Fe(s)→Fe2+(aq)+2e−
Reduction half-reaction (occurs at the cathode):
O2(g)+2H2O(/lscript)+4e−→4OH−(aq)
Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by two and add the half-reactions
to obtain the overall cell reaction.
2Fe (s)+O2(g)+2H2O(/lscript)→2Fe2+(aq)+4OH−(aq)
There is no barrier in the cell, so nothing stops the dissolved Fe2+and
OH−ions from mixing. The iron(II) ions produced at the anode and the
hydroxide ions produced at the cathode react to form a precipitate ofiron(II) hydroxide, Fe(OH)
2. Therefore, the overall cell reaction could
be written as follows.
2Fe (s)+O2(g)+2H2O(/lscript)→2Fe(OH) 2(s)
The iron(II) hydroxide undergoes further oxidation by reaction with the
oxygen in the air to form iron(III) hydroxide.

548 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryIron(III) hydroxide readily breaks down to form hydrated iron(III) oxide,
Fe2O3•xH2O, more commonly known as rust. As noted earlier, the “x”
signi ﬁes a variable number of water molecules per formula unit.
2Fe(OH) 3(s)→Fe2O3•3H2O(s)
Both Fe(OH) 3and Fe2O3•xH2Oare reddish-brown, or “rust coloured. ”
A rust deposit may contain a mixture of these compounds.
Fortunately, not all metals corrode to the same extent as iron. Many
metals do corrode in air to form a surface coating of metal oxide.However, in many cases, the oxide layer adheres, or sticks ﬁrmly, to the
metal surface. This layer protects the metal from further corrosion. Forexample, aluminum, chromium, and magnesium are readily oxidized inair to form their oxides, Al
2O3, Cr2O3, and MgO. Unless the oxide layer is
broken by a cut or a scratch, the layer prevents further corrosion. In con-trast, rust easily ﬂakes off from the surface of an iron object and provides
little protection against further corrosion.
Corrosion Prevention
Corrosion, and especially the corrosion of iron, can be very destructive.
For this reason, a great deal of effort goes into corrosion prevention. Thesimplest method of preventing corrosion is to paint an iron object. The protective coating of paint prevents air and water from reaching the metalsurface. Other effective protective layers include grease, oil, plastic, or ametal that is more resistant to corrosion than iron. For example, a layer of chromium protects bumpers and metal trim on cars. An enamel coatingis often used to protect metal plates, pots, and pans. Enamel is a shiny,
hard, and very unreactive type of glass that can be melted onto a metalsurface. A protective layer is effective as long as it completely covers theiron object. If a hole or scratch breaks the layer, the metal underneath can corrode.
It is also possible to protect iron against corrosion by forming an alloy
with a different metal. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron that contains at
least 10% chromium, by mass, in addition to small quantities of carbonand occasionally metals such as nickel. Stainless steel is much moreresistant to corrosion than pure iron. Therefore, stainless steel is oftenused for cutlery, taps, and various other applications where rust-resistanceis important. However, chromium is much more expensive than iron. As a result, stainless steel is too expensive for use in large-scale applications,such as building bridges.
Galvanizing is a process in which iron is covered with a protective
layer of zinc. Galvanized iron is often used to make metal buckets andchain-link fences. Galvanizing protects iron in two ways. First, the zincacts as a protective layer. If this layer is broken, the iron is exposed to air and water. When this happens, however, the iron is still protected.Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron. Therefore, zinc, not iron, becomesthe anode in the galvanic cell. The zinc metal is oxidized to zinc ions. Inthis situation, zinc is known as a sacriﬁcial anode , because it is destroyed
(sacri ﬁced) to protect the iron. Iron acts as the cathode when zinc is pres-
ent. Thus, iron does not undergo oxidation until all the zinc has reacted.
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 549Cathodic protection is another method of preventing rusting, as
shown in Figure 11.29. As in galvanizing, a more reactive metal isattached to the iron object. This reactive metal acts as a sacri ﬁcial anode,
and the iron becomes the cathode of a galvanic cell. Unlike galvanizing,the metal used in cathodic protection does not completely cover the iron.Because the sacri ﬁcial anode is slowly destroyed by oxidation, it must be
replaced periodically.
If iron is covered with a protective layer of a metal that is lessreactive
than iron, there can be unfortunate results. A “tin” can is actually a steel
can coated with a thin layer of tin. While the tin layer remains intact, itprovides effective protection against rusting. If the tin layer is broken orscratched, however, the iron in the steel corrodes faster in contact with
the tin than the iron would on its own. Since tin is less reactive than iron, tin acts as a cathode in each galvanic cell on the surface of the can.Therefore, the tin provides a large area of available cathodes for the smallgalvanic cells involved in the rusting process. Iron acts as the anode ofeach cell, which is its normal role when rusting.
Sometimes, the rusting of iron is promoted accidentally. For example,
by connecting an iron pipe to a copper pipe in a plumbing system, aninexperienced plumber could accidentally speed up the corrosion of theiron pipe. Copper is less reactive than iron. Therefore, copper acts as thecathode and iron as the anode in numerous small galvanic cells at theintersection of the two pipes.
Build on your understanding of corrosion by completing the following
practice problems.
25. (a) Use the two half-reactions for the rusting process, and a table
of standard reduction potentials. Determine the standard cellpotential for this reaction.
(b)Do you think that your calculated value is the actual cell potentialfor each of the small galvanic cells on the surface of a rusting ironobject? Explain.
26.Explain why aluminum provides cathodic protection to an ironobject.
27.In the year 2000, Transport Canada reported that thousands of carssold in the Atlantic Provinces between 1989 and 1999 had corrodedengine cradle mounts. Failure of these mounts can cause the steeringshaft to separate from the car. The manufacturer recalled the cars so that repairs could be made, where necessary. The same cars were sold across the country. Why do you think that the corrosionproblems showed up in the Atlantic Provinces?
28. (a) Use a table of standard reduction potentials to determine whetherelemental oxygen, O
2(g), is a better oxidizing agent under acidic
conditions or basic conditions.
(b)From your answer to part (a), do you think that acid rain promotesor helps prevent the rusting of iron?Practice Problems

or aluminum blocks are attached toships ’ hulls, oil and gas pipelines,

Automobile Engines
The internal combustion engine found in most automobiles uses
gasoline as a fuel. Unfortunately, this type of engine produces pollutants,such as carbon dioxide ( CO
2), nitrogen oxides ( NO x), and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants contribute to health andenvironmental problems, such as smog and the greenhouse effect. In addition, the internal combustion engine is very inef ﬁcient. It converts
only about 25% of the chemical energy of the fuel into the kinetic energy of the car. Electric cars, such as those shown in Figure 11.30, may provide a more ef ﬁcient and less harmful alternative.
Manufacturers and researchers have attempted to power
electric cars with rechargeable batteries, such as modi ﬁed lead-acid
and nickel-cadmium batteries. However, rechargeable batteries run down fairly quickly. The distance driven before recharging a battery may be 250 km or less. The battery must then be recharged from an external electrical source. Recharging the lead-acid battery of an electriccar takes several hours. Cars based on a version of the nickel-cadmiumbattery can be recharged in only ﬁfteen minutes. However, recharging
the batteries of an electric car is still inconvenient.
A new type of power supply for electric cars eliminates the need for
recharging. A fuel cell is a battery that produces electricity while reactants
are supplied continuously from an external source. Because reactants continuously ﬂow into the cell, a fuel cell is also known as a ﬂow battery .
Unlike the fuel supply of a more conventional battery, the fuel supply in afuel cell is unlimited. As in the combustion of gasoline in a conventionalengine, the overall reaction in a fuel cell is the oxidation of a fuel by oxygen.
The space shuttle uses a fuel cell as a source of energy. This cell
depends on the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to form water. The fuel cell operates under basic conditions, so it is sometimes referred to as an alkaline fuel cell . Figure 11.31, on the next page, shows the design
of the cell. The half-reactions and the overall reaction are as follows.
Reduction (occurs at the cathode): O
2(g)+2H2O(/lscript)+4e−→4OH−(aq)
Oxidation (occurs at the anode): H2(g)+2OH−(aq)→2H2O(/lscript)+2e−
Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 2, add the two half-reactions, and
simplify to obtain the overall cell reaction.
2H2(g)+O2(g)→2H2O(/lscript)
Notice that the overall equation is the same as the equation for the
combustion of hydrogen. The combustion of hydrogen is an exothermicreaction. In the fuel cell, this reaction produces energy in the form of electricity, rather than heat.
550 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryMany electric cars
are currently under development. In fact, the idea of electric cars isnot new. In the early days of theautomobile, electric cars were morecommon than gasoline-poweredcars. The production of electric carspeaked in 1912, but then completelystopped in the 1930s.Figure 11.30
Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 551In an alkaline fuel cell, the half-reactions do not include solid conductors of
electrons. Therefore, the cell has two inert electrodes.
The hydrogen fuel cell produces water vapour, which does not contribute
to smog formation or to the greenhouse effect. This product makes thehydrogen fuel cell an attractive energy source for cars. Also, the hydrogenfuel cell is much more ef ﬁcient than the internal combustion engine. A
hydrogen fuel cell converts about 80% of the chemical energy of the fuelinto the kinetic energy of the car.
There is a possible problem with the hydrogen fuel cell. The cell
requires hydrogen fuel. Unfortunately, uncombined hydrogen is not foundnaturally on Earth. Most hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbon fuels,such as petroleum or methane. These manufacturing processes may contribute signi ﬁcantly to pollution problems. However, hydrogen can
also be produced by the electrolysis of water. If a source such as solarenergy or hydroelectricity is used to power the electrolysis, the overallquantity of pollution is low.
The following practice problems will allow you to test your

552 MHR • Unit 5  ElectrochemistryWater Treatment and the Chlor-Alkali Process
In many countries, water is not safe to drink. Untreated water is
sometimes polluted with toxic chemicals. It may also carry numerouswater-borne diseases, including typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. In Canada, the water that comes through your tap has been through anelaborate puri ﬁcation process. This process is designed to remove solid
particles and toxic chemicals, and to reduce the number of bacteria to safe levels. Adding chlorine to water is the most common way todestroy bacteria.
You have already seen that chlorine gas can be made by the
electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. In industry, some chlorine is produced in this way using the Downs cell described earlier. However,more chlorine is produced in Canada using a different method, called the chlor-alkali process . In this process, brine is electrolyzed in a cell
like the one shown in Figure 11.32. Brine is a saturated solution of
sodium chloride.Canadians in Chemistry
Dr. Viola Birss
As a science student, Viola Birss decided to focus
on chemistry. “I have always had a concern for
the environment, ” she says. “I am particularly
interested in identifying new, non-polluting ways of converting, storing, and using energy. ” Dr. Birss ’s
interest in non-polluting energy narrowed her ﬁeld
of interest to electrochemistry.
Today, Dr. Birss is a chemistry professor at the
University of Calgary. Her research focuses ondeveloping ﬁlms to coat metal surfaces. Among
other uses, these ﬁlms can serve as protective
barriers against corrosion, and as catalysts in fuel cells.Magnesium alloys are very lightweight, and are
being used in the aerospace industry. Because theyare very reactive, these alloys need to be protectedfrom corrosion. Dr. Birss holds a patent on a newapproach to the electrochemical formation of protec-tive oxide ﬁlms on magnesium alloys. Dr. Birss also
works on developing new catalysts for fuel cells, and studies the factors that lead to the breakdown of fuel cells.
After ﬁnishing an undergraduate degree at the
University of Calgary, Dr. Birss went on to completeher doctoral degree as a Commonwealth Scholar atthe University of Auckland in New Zealand. Duringher postdoctoral studies at the University of Ottawa,she worked with Dr. Brian Conway, a famousCanadian electrochemist. Dr. Conway ’s work in
electrochemistry has led to progress in a range ofelectrochemical devices including fuel cells,advanced batteries, and electrolytic cells.
Dr. Birss takes pride in her team of undergradu-
ate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. She workshard to provide a creative and inspiring environmentfor them. Together, they go on wilderness hiking and cross country ski trips. In addition to creating a sense of community within her team, Birss feelsthat sports and nature help to recharge her internal“battery. ” Dr. Birss comments, “These activities

Chapter 11  Cells and Batteries • MHR 553The chlor-alkali cell in this diagram electrolyzes an aqueous solution of
sodium chloride to produce chlorine gas, hydrogen gas, and aqueous sodium hydroxide. The asbestos diaphragm stops the chlorine gas produced at the anode from mixing with thehydrogen gas produced at the cathode. Sodium hydroxide solution is removed from the cellperiodically, and fresh brine is added to the cell.
The half-reactions and the overall cell reaction in the chlor-alkali process
are as follows.
Oxidation: 2Cl−(aq)→Cl2(g)+2e−
Reduction: 2H2O(/lscript)+2e−→H2(g)+2OH−(aq)
Overall: 2Cl−(aq)+2H2O(/lscript)→Cl2(g)+H2(g)+2OH−(aq)
Note that the sodium ion is a spectator ion, and does not take part in this
reaction. However, it combines with OH−to produce sodium hydroxide,
as shown by the balanced chemical equation below.
2NaCl (aq)+2H2O(/lscript)→Cl2(g)+H2(g)+2NaOH (aq)
The products of the chlor-alkali process are all useful. Sodium hydroxide
is used to make soaps and detergents. It is widely used as a base in manyother industrial chemical reactions, as well. The hydrogen produced bythe chlor-alkali process is used as a fuel. Chlorine has many uses besideswater treatment. For example, chlorine is used as a bleach in the pulp andpaper industry. Chlorine is also used in the manufacture of chlorinatedorganic compounds, such as the common plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
The chlorination of water is usually carried out by adding chlorine
gas, sodium hypochlorite, or calcium hypochlorite to the water in lowconcentrations. The active antibacterial agent in each case is hypochlorousacid, HClO
(aq). For example, when chlorine gas is added to water,
hypochlorous acid is formed by the following reaction.
Cl2(g)+H2O(/lscript)→HClO (aq)+HCl (aq)
Some people object to the chlorination of water, and prefer to drink
bottled spring water. There is controversy over the level of risk associatedwith chlorination, and over the possible bene ﬁts of spring water. For
example, hypochlorous acid reacts with traces of organic materials in the water supply. These reactions can produce toxic substances, such aschloroform. Supporters of chlorination believe that these substances arepresent at very low, safe levels, but opponents of chlorination disagree.Complete the following practice problems to help you decide on yourown opinion of chlorination.Figure 11.32e−e−

Background
The most beautiful metals, such as silver and
gold, can also be the most expensive.Unfortunately, pure gold is soft, and pure silvertarnishes quickly.
Electroplating is a common method used to
produce beautiful and durable metal objects.Jewellery and other metal objects can be madecheaper, stronger, and more durable by coating astrong, cheaper metal with a thin layer of a moreexpensive metal. For example, cheaper jewellerycan be made from copper or nickel, and thencoated with silver. More expensive jewellery canbe made from silver, and then coated with gold.
Industry also uses electroplating for many
applications. Chromium, an extremely hard surface metal, is commonly electroplated oversteel cores for heavy duty applications. Worn ordamaged metal machine parts may be restored byre-plating the worn sections.Pre-Lab Focus
In this investigation, you will design an electrolytic cell to plate zinc onto a metal objectof your choice. You will repeat your procedureusing three different currents, and then compareyour ﬁnal products. When designing your proce-dure, consider questions such as the following.• How will you clean the pieces of metal you
want to plate?
• What concentration of electrolyte will you use?• What external voltage will you use?• What three current values will you try?• What will you use for the anode in your cell?• What will you use for the cathode in your cell?• What time limit will you set for the electro-
plating process?
Question
What conditions work best for electroplating zinconto a metal object? Does changing the currentaffect the quality of the ﬁnished object?
Hypothesis
Predict whether the value of the current used to carry out the plating affects the quality of theﬁnished object.

Silverions are reduced to silver metal, and bromideions are oxidized to bromine atoms. Thebrighter the light that hits the ﬁlm, the greateris the decomposition. When the ﬁlm is developed, the parts of the ﬁlm that contain the most silver metal produce the darkestregions on the negative. In other words, thebrightest parts of the photographed scene givethe darkest parts of the image on the negative.High-speed black-and-white ﬁlm uses silveriodide in place of silver bromide. Do you thinkthat silver iodide is more sensitive or less sensitive to light than silver bromide?

The Chemistry of Human Health
It is tempting to think of science as a clearly
deﬁned set of disciplines, such as chemistry,physics, and biology. This is not wholly accurate, however. Scientiﬁc disciplines blend and overlap.Therefore, scientists need to know what is hap-pening in relevant areas of different disciplines.For example, if you are studying physics, youhave probably noticed that both chemists andphysicists contributed to the development of the atomic theory. The physicists built on the discoveries of the chemists, and vice versa.
The health sciences are a group of disciplines
that draw upon chemistry, physics, and biology.How does chemistry relate to the health sciences?Knowing about molecular structure and functionallows biochemists to synthesize medicinal com-pounds on a large scale, and even to design newmolecules to ﬁght diseases and their symptoms.Understanding the chemical role of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals in the body helps dieticians develop healthy dietary guidelines.
Knowing the properties of materials helpsresearchers develop new materials and devices—such as titanium joints, plastic heart valves, andartiﬁcial skin—to repair, maintain, and replaceparts of the human body.
The developments just described, and many
others, are possible because health scientists and chemists communicate by writing books, journal articles, and letters. They use the Internetto post results and hold discussions. They alsocommunicate face-to-face by giving presentationsand lectures, and by chatting over coffee. A scientiﬁc conference is the perfect place for suchface-to-face interactions.
In this Course Challenge, you will investigate
different facets of the intersection of chemistrywith the health sciences. Then you will share yourﬁndings and learn from your peers in a conferenceabout the chemistry of human health.

The Chemistry of Human Health • MHR 565Part 1: The Citric Acid Cycle
Metabolism is a complex series of interdependent organic reactions that
power the body by breaking down food molecules to provide energy. Animportant part of human metabolism is the breakdown of glucose to pro-vide energy for the body. First, a metabolic process called glycolysis
breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, C
3H4O3. The
pyruvate molecules then react with a chemical species called coenzyme
A, CoA, to form acetyl CoA . Acetyl CoA reacts with oxaloacetic acid
to begin the metabolic cycle called the citric acid cycle , shown in the
diagram below. The citric acid cycle is also called the Krebs cycle, after its discoverer, Hans Krebs.
This diagram shows the citric acid cycle. For simplicity, the molecules in the citric
acid cycle are represented here as acids. In the body, they are actually present as ions.For example, citric acid is present as citrate ions.
Challenge
Use the diagram of the citric acid cycle to answer the following questions.
Examine the acids that are formed in each step of the citric acid
cycle (do not include succinyl CoA). Redraw the acids. Then circle andidentify the functional groups that are present on each acid.K/U 1CCH2

oxaloacetate. Which carbons in the citric acid molecule do you thinkare likely the carbons that were added from acetyl CoA? Justify youranswer.
In the citric acid cycle, every step that is an oxidation reaction
also produces energy, until the most oxidized form of carbon leaves the cycle as carbon dioxide. Which steps in the cycle produce energy?
Create a large version of the citric acid cycle. You may want to

Think and Research
Ketoacidosis is a dangerous condition that is characterized by the
acidi ﬁcation of the blood and an acetone odour on the breath. The
condition occurs when levels of oxaloacetic acid for the citric acidcycle are low. This leads to a buildup of acetyl CoA molecules, which the liver metabolizes to produce acidic ketone bodies. Since carbohydrates are the main source of oxaloacetic acid in the body,high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets have been linked to ketoacidosis.
(a)Why do people follow these diets? Do you think the bene ﬁts of these
diets justify the risks?

Part 2: Materials for Replacing Human Body Parts
Science has come a long way since wooden “pegs” were used to replace
lost legs. Prosthetics are now made of lightweight, long-lasting materials.Engineers have developed replacement joints that function in much thesame way as the original human joints. Understanding the properties ofmaterials is key to developing prosthetics that function well with livinghuman bodies, are relatively comfortable, and last a long time.

Create an information kit that explains why you chose the materialsyou did. For example, you will want to describe each material ’s
reactivity, strength, and density, as well as other properties. Describeany problems you foresee with your replacement part. Will it reactwith ﬂuids in the body? Will it wear out quickly? (Instead of building a
replacement bone or joint, you may choose to create a prosthetic limb.)
Conduct some tests on the materials you used for your replacement
part to determine or con ﬁrm their physical properties. Relate the
properties of each material to the type of bonding present. Obtain your teacher ’s permission before conducting your tests.
Use print and electronic resources to ﬁnd out what kinds of
materials are being used and developed for use as prosthetic limbs. Be sure to explain what properties make each material suitable for itsuse. How does the chemical bonding in each material relate to its prop-erties? What are the risks and bene ﬁts associated with the materials?

Think and Research
Hydrogen peroxide is often used to sterilize wounds. The ﬁzzing
that occurs is caused by catalase in the blood acting on the hydrogenperoxide. Bacteria that do not have catalase to disable the hydrogenperoxide are killed by this chemical. Humans are protected by thepresence of catalase. Not all bacteria are killed by hydrogen peroxide,however, because some bacteria do have catalase.
(a)Suggest a laboratory procedure that a researcher could use to classifyspecies of bacteria as catalase -positive or catalase -negative .
(b)Use print and electronic resources to ﬁnd three dangerous species of
bacteria that are catalase-positive and three dangerous species thatare catalase-negative. Propose safe ways to guard against both types.
Part 4: Blood and Le Châtelier’s Principle
In Unit 4, you learned that buffers resist changes in pH. Buffer systems areextremely important to human health, since many of the life-sustainingreactions in the body depend on a narrow pH range to proceed effectively.
The principal buffer system in blood serum is based on the equilibri-
um between carbonic acid, H
2CO3(aq), and the hydrogen carbonate ion,
HCO 3−. Carbonic acid is unstable, however. It is also in equilibrium with
carbon dioxide. Therefore, a second equilibrium reaction is involved inthe hydrogen carbonate buffer system in the blood: the reaction betweencarbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid, and its reverse. Thetwo equilibrium reactions are summarized below.

Part 4 draws upon the skills and
concepts you learned in Unit 4.You will use your understanding ofequilibrium to analyze the buffersystem in blood serum.Preview
The Chemistry of Human Health • MHR 569Challenge
Refer to the description of the hydrogen carbonate buffer system in blood
serum to answer questions 1 and 2. Then use questions 3 and 4 to designan investigation to ﬁnd out how a buffer system resists changes in pH.
One of the differences between a buffer system in the body and a
simple buffer system in a lab is that the body can enhance the buffer ’s
power to resist pH changes. For example, the lungs regulate the amountof carbon dioxide that enters and leaves the body. The kidneys help to regulate the pH of blood in several ways, such as increasing ordecreasing excretion of hydronium ions, H
3O+, in urine. Explain how
the kidneys might respond to the following conditions.
(a)The blood pH rises to 7.48.
(b)The blood pH sinks to 7.33.
Healthy blood has a pH of 7.4. Estimate the ratio of [ CO2] to
[HCO 3−] in the blood. Use the following assumptions and information
to help you.
•Assume that carbonic acid and hydrogen carbonate ions are the only
contributors to blood pH.
•Use Ka=4.3×10−7for H2CO3.
•To express your answer in terms of CO2, assume that all
undissociated carbonic acid is present as dissolved CO2.
Because blood is buffered, it resists changes in pH. To model
blood ’s resistance to changes in pH, design an investigation that
compares the effects of adding an acid or a base to buffered and non-buffered systems. Your teacher will tell you what materials youmay use. The following tips and suggestions will help you get started.
•You can prepare a simple buffer system by mixing equal volumes
of 0.1 mol/L acetic acid, CH
3COOH , and 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate,
NaCH 3COO . Alternatively, you may wish to try more closely
simulating the buffer system in blood. Use soda water, which contains dissolved CO
2, and sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking
soda), NaHCO 3. Your teacher may suggest other buffer systems.
•Consider carrying out your investigation on the microscale.
•You will need to decide how to monitor pH changes. You may
choose to use a pH meter or a universal indicator, for example.
•Decide what type and concentration of acid and base you will add to
your systems. Dilute solutions of strong acids and bases work well.
•Include a step in which you determine the initial pH of your buffer
solution and the unbuffered system.
•Include all appropriate safety precautions.
Obtain your teacher ’s approval for your procedure, and carry out your
investigation.
Prepare a detailed report to communicate your ﬁndings. Be sure to
compare and contrast the system you used in your investigation withthe carbonic acid/carbonate buffer system in the blood. How are thesystems similar? How are they different?C 4I 3I 2K/U 1

calculations that involve complex systems in order tomake an estimate. They do this by making simplifyingassumptions. You will try this technique for yourself inChallenge question 2.FACTCHEM

(b)Explain why insuf ﬁcient ventilation or breathing dif ﬁculties lead to
respiratory acidosis. Refer to the carbonic acid/hydrogen carbonatebuffer system in your answer.
(c)To help maintain the pH of the blood, the kidneys can increase or decrease reabsorption of HCO

decrease or increase the excretion of H3O+ions. How would the
kidneys respond to respiratory acidosis? Explain your answer.
(d)Suggest ways that you could help someone who was suffering from respiratory acidosis as a result of having been in an area with insuf ﬁcient ventilation.
Part 5: Vitamin C—An Important Antioxidant
Oxygen and other oxidizing agents can react harmfully with your body.
Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant. It is very easily oxidized, so it reactswith oxidizing agents, preventing them from reacting with other important molecules in the body. Vitamin C is relatively stable when it is oxidized. Therefore, it does not propagate a harmful series of oxida-tion reactions. The Chemistry Bulletin in Unit 5 explains the possibleconnection between oxidizing agents and aging.
One way to determine the vitamin C content of a sample is to titrate
it with an iodine/iodide solution. The diagram below shows the reactioninvolved.
In the iodine solution, iodine, I
2, and iodide, I−, ions are in equilibrium
with triiodide, as shown below.
I2+I−/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfI3−
Molecular iodine is a deep violet-red colour. Iodine ions are colourless.
Thus, when an antioxidant reduces the iodine molecules in a solution, theiodine colour disappears completely.

The Chemistry of Human Health • MHR 571Iodine solutions may be used to titrate solutions that contain
antioxidants, such as vitamin C.
(a)In storage, the concentration of iodine in solution decreases fairlyquickly over time. Why do you think this happens?
(b)Because the iodine solution ’s concentration is not stable, it should be
standardized frequently. To standardize an iodine solution, use it totitrate a solution that contains a known quantity of vitamin C. Thendetermine what volume of iodine solution is needed to react withthe known quantity of vitamin C. Explain how you would stand-ardize a solution of iodine using vitamin C tablets from a pharmacy.
(c)To standardize iodine using vitamin C tablets, you should use freshtablets. Explain why.
Design a titration that uses an iodine solution to determine and
compare the concentration of vitamin C in a variety of fresh fruitjuices. You may ﬁnd it helpful to research appropriate procedures on
the Internet. Include a method for standardizing the iodine solution.(See Challenge question 1.) Make sure that you list all the safety precautions you will use in your titration. Check your procedure with your teacher, and then carry out your titration.
Prepare a detailed report to communicate your results. Include the
half-reaction for iodine in your discussion of the titration.
If you titrate orange juice that has been exposed to the air for
a week, will the vitamin C concentration be different from the vitaminC concentration in fresh juice? If so, will it decrease or increase?Explain your prediction, in terms of redox reactions.
If time permits, extend your investigation to compare the vitamin C
content of fresh juice and juice that has been left exposed to air forvarying periods of time. Ask your teacher to approve your procedurebefore carrying out this extension.

Signi ﬁcant Digits
All measurements involve uncertainty. One source
of this uncertainty is the measuring device itself.Another source is your ability to perceive and interpreta reading. In fact, you cannot measure anything withcomplete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement is always an estimate.
The digits that you record when you measure
something are called signiﬁcant digits . Signi ﬁcant
digits include the digits that you are certain about, anda ﬁnal, uncertain digit that you estimate. Follow
the rules below to identify the number of signi ﬁcant
digits in a measurement.
Rules for Determining Signiﬁcant Digits
Rule 1 All non-zero numbers are signi ﬁcant.
•7.886 has four signi ﬁcant digits.
•19.4 has three signi ﬁcant digits.
•527.266 992 has nine signi ﬁcant digits.
Rule 2 All zeros that are located between two non-zero
numbers are signi ﬁcant.
•408 has three signi ﬁcant digits.
•25 074 has ﬁve signi ﬁcant digits.
Rule 3 Zeros that are located to the left of a measure-
ment are notsigni ﬁcant.
•0.0907 has three signi ﬁcant digits: the 9, the
third 0 to the right, and the 7.
Rule 4 Zeros that are located to the right of a measure-
ment may or may not be signi ﬁcant.
•22 700 may have three signi ﬁcant digits, if the
measurement is approximate.
•22 700 may have ﬁve signi ﬁcant digits, if the
measurement is taken carefully.
When you take measurements and use them to calculate
other quantities, you must be careful to keep track ofwhich digits in your calculations and results are signi ﬁ-
cant. Why? Your results should not imply more certaintythan your measured quantities justify. This is especiallyimportant when you use a calculator. Calculators usuallyreport results with far more digits than your data warrant.Always remember that calculators do not make decisionsabout certainty. You do. Follow the rules given below toreport signi ﬁcant digits in a calculated answer.
Rules for Reporting Signiﬁcant Digits in
Calculations
Rule 1 Multiplying and Dividing
The value with the fewest number of signi ﬁcant
digits, going into a calculation, determines thenumber of signi ﬁcant digits that you should
report in your answer.Rule 2 Adding and Subtracting
The value with the fewest number of decimalplaces, going into a calculation, determines thenumber of decimal places that you should reportin your answer.
Rule 3 Rounding
To get the appropriate number of signi ﬁcant
digits (rule 1) or decimal places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer.
•If your answer ends in a number that is greater
than 5, increase the preceding digit by 1. Forexample, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35.
•If your answer ends with a number that is less
than 5, leave the preceding number unchanged.For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7.
•If your answer ends with 5, increase the
preceding number by 1 if it is odd. Leave thepreceding number unchanged if it is even. Forexample, 18.35 can be rounded to 18.4, but18.25 is rounded to 18.2.
Problem
Suppose that you measure the masses of fourobjects as 12.5 g, 145.67 g, 79.0 g, and 38.438 g.What is the total mass?
What Is Required?
You need to calculate the total mass of the objects.
What Is Given?
You know the mass of each object.
Plan Your Strategy
• Add the masses together, aligning them at the
decimal point.
• Underline the estimated (farthest right) digit in
each value. This is a technique you can use tohelp you keep track of the number of estimateddigits in your ﬁnal answer.
• In the question, two values have the fewest
decimal places: 12.5 and 79.0. You need to round your answer so that it has only one decimal place.
Act on Your Strategy

Therefore, the total mass of the objects is 275.6 g.Sample Problem
Using Significant Digits
Appendix D • MHR 591Figure D.3 shows you how to calculate the mass of one
mole of water using a scienti ﬁc calculator. When you
enter an exponent on a scienti ﬁc calculator, you do not
have to enter ( ×10).
On some scienti ﬁc calculators, the ¨key
is labelled ´. Key in negative exponents by entering the
exponent, then striking the —key.
Rules for Scientiﬁc Notation
Rule 1 To multiply two numbers in scienti ﬁc notation,
add the exponents.
(7.32 ×10−3)×(8.91 ×10−2)
=(7.32 ×8.91) ×10(−3+−2)
=65.2212 ×10−5
→6.52 ×10−4
Rule 2 To divide two numbers in scienti ﬁc notation,
subtract the exponents.
(1.842 ×106g)÷(1.0787 ×102g/mol)
=(1.842 ÷1.0787) ×10(6−2)
=1.707611 ×104g
→1.708 ×104g
Rule 3 To add or subtract numbers in scienti ﬁc notation,
ﬁrst convert the numbers so they have the same
exponent. Each number should have the sameexponent as the number with the greatest powerof 10. Once the numbers are all expressed to thesame power of 10, the power of 10 is neitheradded nor subtracted in the calculation.
(3.42 ×10
6cm) +(8.53 ×103cm)
=(3.42 ×106cm) +(0.00853 ×106cm)
=3.42853 ×106cm
→3.43 ×106cm
(9.93 ×101L)−(7.86 ×10−1L)
=(9.93 ×101L)−(0.0786 ×101L)
=9.8514 ×101L
→9.85 ×101L

Scienti ﬁc Notation
One mole of water, H2O, contains
602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000 molecules. Each molecule has a mass of 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9 g. As you can see,it would be very awkward to calculate the mass of onemole of water using these values. To simplify largenumbers when reporting them and doing calculations,you can use scienti ﬁc notation.
Step 1 Move the decimal point so that only one
non-zero digit is in front of the decimal point.(Note that this number is now between 1.0 and9.99999999.) Count the number of places that thedecimal point moves to the left or to the right.
Step 2 Multiply the value by a power of 10. Use the
number of places that the decimal point movedas the exponent for the power of 10. If the deci-mal point moved to the right, exponent is nega-tive. If the decimal point moved to the left, theexponent is positive.

592 MHR • Appendix DThere are logarithms for all numbers, not just whole
multiples of 10. What is the pH of a solution if
[H3O+]=0.004 76 mol/L ? Enter 0.00476. Press the
[LOG] key and then the [ ±] key. The answer is 2.322.
This result has three signi ﬁcant digits —the same
number of signi ﬁcant digits as the concentration.
What if you want to ﬁnd [H3O+]from the pH? You
would need to ﬁnd 10−pH. For example, what is [H3O+]
if the pH is 5.78? Enter 5.78, and press the [ ±] key. Then
use the [10x]function. The answer is 10−5.78. Therefore,
[H3O+]is 1.7×10−6mol/L .
Remember that the pH scale is a negative log scale.
Thus, a decrease in pH from pH 7 to pH 4 is an increaseof 10
3, or 1000, in the acidity of a solution. An increase
from pH 3 to pH 6 is a decrease of 103, or 1000, in
acidity.Logarithms
Logarithms are a convenient method for communicatinglarge and small numbers. The logarithm , or “log,” of a
number is the value of the exponent that 10 would have to be raised to, in order to equal this number.Every positive number has a logarithm. Numbers thatare greater than 1 have a positive logarithm. Numbersthat are between 0 and 1 have a negative logarithm.Table D1 gives some examples of the logarithm values of numbers.
Table D.1 Some Numbers and Their Logarithms
Logarithms are especially useful for expressing values
that span a range of powers of 10. The Richter scale forearthquakes, the decibel scale for sound, and the pHscale for acids and bases all use logarithmic scales.
Logarithms and pH
The pH of an acid solution is de ﬁned as −log[H 3O+].
(The square brackets mean “concentration. ”) For
example, suppose that the hydronium ion concentrationin a solution is 0.0001 mol/L (10
−4mol/L) . The pH is
−log(0.0001). To calculate this, enter 0.0001 into your
calculator. Then press the [LOG] key. Press the [ ±] key.
The answer in the display is 4. Therefore, the pH of thesolution is 4.NumberScientific

Appendix D • MHR 593Remember that counting numbers for exact quantities are
considered to have in ﬁnite signi ﬁcant digits. For example,
if you have 3 apples, the number is exact, and has an inﬁnite number of signi ﬁcant digits. Conversion factors
for unit analysis are a form of counting or record keeping.Therefore, you do not need to consider the number of signi ﬁcant digits in conversion factors, such as 1000 mL/
1 L, when deciding on the number of signi ﬁcant digits in
the answer.The Unit Analysis Method of Problem
Solving
The unit analysis method of problem solving is
extremely versatile. You can use it to convert betweenunits or to solve some formula problems. If you forget aformula during a test, you may still be able to solve theproblem using unit analysis.
The unit analysis method involves analyzing the
units and setting up conversion factors. You match and arrange the units so that they divide out to give the desired unit in the answer. Then you multiply and divide the numbers that correspond to the units.
Steps for Solving Problems Using Unit
Analysis
Step 1 Determine which data you have and which
conversion factors you need to use. (A conver-sion factor is usually a ratio of two numbers with units, such as 1000 g/1 kg. You multiply the given data by the conversion factor to get the desired units for the answer.) It is often convenient to use the following three categoriesto set up your solution: Have, Need, andConversion factor.
Step 2 Arrange the data and conversion factors so that
you can cross out the undesired units. Decidewhether you need any additional conversion factors to get the desired units for the answer.
Step 3 Multiply all the numbers on the top of the ratio.
Then multiply all the numbers on the bottom ofthe ratio. Divide the top result by the bottomresult.
Step 4 Check that you have cancelled the units correct-
ly. Also check that the answer seems reasonable,and that the signi ﬁcant digits are correct.
The sample problem on the next page will show you
how to solve a stoichiometric problem.Problem

Rinsing the Pipette
A pipette is used to measure and transfer a precise
volume of liquid. You rinse a pipette with the solu-tion whose volume you are measuring. This ensuresthat the solution will not be diluted or contaminated.
1.Pour a sample of standard solution into a clean,
dry beaker.
2.Place the pipette tip in a beaker of distilled water.
Squeeze the suction bulb. Maintain your gripwhile placing it over the stem of the pipette. Donot insert the stem into the bulb. (If your suctionbulbs have valves, your teacher will show youhow to use them.)
Draw a bit
more liquid than you needinto the pipette. It is easierto reduce this volume than it is to add more solution tothe pipette.Figure F.1
The bottom of
the meniscus must alignexactly with the etchedmark.Figure F.2
You can prevent a
“stubborn ” drop from clinging to
the pipette tip by touching the tip tothe inside of the glass surface.Figure F.3
3.Relax your grip on the bulb to draw up a small vol-
ume of distilled water.
4.Remove the bulb, and discard the water by letting it
drain out.
5.Rinse the pipette by drawing several millilitres of
solution from the beaker into it. Rotate and rock thepipette to coat the inner surface with solution.Discard the rinse. Rinse the pipette twice in thisway. It is now ready to ﬁll with standard solution.
Filling the Pipette
6.Place the tip of the pipette below the surface of
the solution.
7.Hold the suction bulb loosely on the end of the
glass stem. Use the suction bulb to draw liquidup just past the etched volume mark. (See FigureF.1.)
8.As quickly and smoothly as you can, slide the
bulb off and place your index ﬁnger over the end
of the glass stem.9.Gently roll your ﬁnger slightly away from end of
the stem to let solution drain slowly out.
10.When the bottom of the meniscus aligns with the
etched mark, as in Figure F.2, press your ﬁnger
back over the end of the stem. This will preventmore solution from draining out.
11.Touch the tip of the pipette to the side of the beaker
to remove any clinging drop. See Figure F.3. Themeasured volume inside the pipette is now readyto be transferred to an Erlenmeyer ﬂask or a volu-
metric ﬂask.Titration Guidelines
Never use your mouth instead of a suction bulb
to draw a liquid into a pipette. The liquid could be corrosive or poisonous. As well, you would contami-nate the glass stem.TITRATION TIP
Practice removing the bulb and replacing it with
your index ﬁnger (or thumb). You need to be able
to perform this action quickly and smoothly.TITRATION TIP
Appendix F • MHR 601Transferring the Solution
12.Place the tip of the pipette against the inside
glass wall of the ﬂask. Let the solution drain
slowly, by removing your ﬁnger from the stem.
13.After the solution drains, wait several seconds
and then touch the tip to the inside wall of theﬂask to remove any drop on the end. Note: You
may notice a small amount of liquid remaining inthe tip. The pipette was calibrated to retain thisamount. Do not try to remove it.
Filling the Burette
19.Assemble a retort stand and burette clamp to
hold the burette. Place a funnel in the top of theburette.
20.With the tap closed, add solution until the liquid
is above the zero mark. Remove the funnel.Carefully open the tap. Drain the liquid into abeaker until the bottom of the meniscus is at orbelow the zero mark.
21.Touch the tip of the burette against the beaker to
remove any clinging drop. Check that the portionof the burette that is below the tap is ﬁlled with
liquid and contains no air bubbles. Rinsing the Burette
A burette is a graduated glass tube with a tap at
one end. It is used to accurately measure the volume of liquid added during a titration experiment.
15.To rinse the burette, close the tap and add about
10 mL of distilled water from a wash bottle.
16.Tip the burette to one side, and roll it gently
back and forth so that the water comes in contact with all inner surfaces.Adding the Indicator
14.Add two or three drops of indicator to the ﬂask
and its contents. Do not add too much indicator.Using more does not make the colour changeeasier to see. Also, indicators are usually weakacids. Too much can change the amount of baseneeded for neutralization. You are now ready toprepare the apparatus for the titration.
22.Record the initial burette reading in your note-
book.
23.Replace the beaker with the Erlenmeyer ﬂask that
you prepared earlier. Place a sheet of white paperunder the Erlenmeyer to help you see the indicatorcolour change that will occur near the endpoint.
Reading the Burette
24.A meniscus reader is a small white card with a thick
black line on it. Hold the card behind the burette,with the black line just under the meniscus, as inFigure F.4. Record the volume added from theburette to the nearest 0.01 mL.A meniscus
reader helps you read the volume of liquid more easily
Figure F.4
17.Hold the burette over a sink. Open the tap, and
let the water drain out. While you do this, checkthat the tap does not leak. Make sure that it turnssmoothly and easily.
18.Rinse the burette with 5 mL to 10 mL of the solu-
tion that will be measured. Remember to openthe tap to rinse the lower portion of the burette.Rinse the burette twice, discarding the liquideach time.
If you are right-handed, the tap should be on your
right as you face the burette. Use your left hand tooperate the tap. Use your right hand to swirl the liquid in the Erlenmeyer ﬂask. If you are left-handed,
reverse this arrangement.TITRATION TIP
Observe the level of solution in the burette so that
your eye is level with the bottom of the meniscus.TITRATION TIPNear the endpoint, when you see the indicator
change colour as liquid enters the ﬂask from the
burette, slow the addition of liquid. The endpoint can occur very quickly.TITRATION TIP

•contributes to environmental hazards, such as acid rain, the greenhouse
effect, and soil erosion
•helps to spread pollutants that are present in all contaminated rivers,
lakes, and oceans
•is used in vast quantities by every industry on Earth

In 1996, a high school student wrote a report about this chemical,
dihydrogen monoxide, for a science fair project. The information in thestudent’s report was completely factual. As a result, 86% of those whoread the report—43 out of 50 students—voted in favour of banning thechemical. What they did not realize was that “dihydrogen monoxide” issimply another name for water.
What if you did not know that water and dihydrogen monoxide are
the same thing? What knowledge and skills can help you distinguish genuine environmental issues from pranks like this one? What otherstrategies can help you interpret all the facts, opinions, half-truths, andfalsehoods that you encounter every day?
This chapter will reacquaint you with the science of chemistry. You

Specific Expectations  Many people, when they hear the word “chemistry,” think of scientists in
white lab coats. They picture bubbling liquids, frothing and churninginside mazes of laboratory glassware.
Is this a fair portrayal of chemistry and chemists? Certainly, chemistry
happens in laboratories. Laboratory chemists often do wear white labcoats, and they do use lots of glassware! Chemistry also happens every-where around you, however. It happens in your home, your school, yourcommunity, and the environment. Chemistry is happening right now,inside every cell in your body. You are alive because of chemical changesand processes.
Chemistry is the study of matter and its composition. Chemistry is
also the study of what happens when matter interacts with other matter.When you mix ingredients for a cake and put the batter in the oven, thatis chemistry. When you pour soda water on a stain to remove it from yourfavourite T-shirt, that is chemistry. When a scientist puts a chunk of anice-like solid into a beaker, causing white mist to ooze over the rim, that is chemistry, too. Figure 1.1 illustrates this interaction, as well as severalother examples of chemistry in everyday life.The Study of Chemistry
AFrozen (solid) carbon dioxide is also known as
“dry ice.” It changes to a gas at temperatures higherthan
−78˚C. In this photograph, warm water has
been used to speed up the process, and foodcolouring has been added.
BDry ice is also used to create special effects for rock
concerts, stage plays, and movies.

Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 7Chemistry: A Blend of Science and Technology
Like all scientists, chemists try to describe and explain the world.
Chemists start by asking questions such as these:•Why is natural gas such an effective fuel?
•How can we separate a mixture of crude oil and water?
•Which materials dissolve in water?
•What is rust and why does it form?
To answer these questions, chemists develop models, conduct
experiments, and seek patterns. They observe various types of chemicalreactions, and they perform calculations based on known data. They buildcontinuously on the work and the discoveries of other scientists.
Long before humans developed a scientiﬁc understanding of the
world, they invented chemical techniques and processes. These tech-niques and processes included smelting and shaping metals, growingcrops, and making medicines. Early chemists invented technologicalinstruments, such as glassware and distillation equipment.
Present-day chemical technologists continue to invent new equipment.
They also invent new or better ways to provide products and services thatpeople want. Chemical technologists ask questions such as the following:•How can we redesign this motor to run on natural gas?
•How can we contain and clean up an oil spill?
•What methods can we use, or develop, to make water safe to drink?
•How can we prevent iron objects from rusting?
DGreen plants use a chemical process, called photo-
synthesis, to convert water and carbon dioxide intothe food substances they need to survive. All thefoods that you eat depend on this process.
EYour body uses chemical processes to break down
food and to release energy.
FYour home is full of products that are manufactured
by chemical industries. The products that are shownhere are often used for cleaning. Some of theseproducts, such as bleach and drain cleaner, can bedangerous if handled improperly.

8 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingChemistry, Technology, Society, and the Environment
Today we beneﬁt in many ways from chemical understanding and tech-
nologies. Each beneﬁt, however, has risks associated with it. The risks andbeneﬁts of chemical processes and technologies affect us either directly orindirectly. Many people—either on their own, in groups, or through theirelected government ofﬁcials—assess these risks and beneﬁts. They askquestions such as the following:•Is it dangerous to use natural gas to heat my home?
•Why is the cost of gasoline so high?
•Is my water really clean enough to drink and use safely?
• How does rust degrade machinery over time?
During your chemistry course this year, you will study the interactions
among science, technology, society, and the environment. These interac-tions are abbreviated as STSE . Throughout the textbook—in examples,
practice problems, activities, investigations, and features—STSE interac-tions are discussed. The issues that appear at the end of some units areespecially rich sources for considering STSE interactions. In these simula-tions, you are encouraged to assess and make decisions about importantissues that affect society and the environment.
STSE Issue: Are Phosphates Helpful or Harmful?
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for life on Earth. Plants need
phosphorus, along with other nutrients, in order to grow. Phosphorus is a component of bones and teeth. In addition, phosphorus is excreted aswaste from the body. Thus, it is present in human sewage.
Since phosphorus promotes plant growth, phosphates are excellent
fertilizers for crops. ( Phosphates are chemicals containing phosphorus.
You will learn more about phosphates later in this unit.) Phosphates arealso used as food additives, and as components in some medicines. Inaddition, they are an important part of dishwasher and laundry deter-gents. For example, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) acts to soften water,and keep dirt suspended in the water. Before the 1970s, STPP was a majoringredient in most detergents.
Phosphates Causing Trouble
In the 1960s, residents around Lake Erie began to notice problems. Thick
growths of algae carpeted the surface of the water. Large amounts of thealgae washed onto beaches, making the beaches unﬁt for swimming. Thewater in the lake looked green, and had an unpleasant odour. As timepassed, certain ﬁsh species in Lake Erie began to decrease.
In 1969, a joint Canadian and American task force pinpointed the
source of the problem. Phosphates and other nutrients were entering thelake, causing algae to grow rapidly. The algae then began to die and rot,using up dissolved oxygen in the water. As a result, ﬁsh and other waterspecies that needed high levels of oxygen were dying off.
The phosphate pollution arrived in the lake from three main sources:
wastewater containing detergents, sewage, and run-off from farms carryingphosphate fertilizers. The task force recommended reducing the amountof phosphate in detergents. They also suggested removing phosphorus atwastewater treatment plants before the treated water entered the lake.
Detergent manufacturers were upset by the proposed reduction in
phosphates. Without this chemical, their detergents would be less effec-
Eutrophication is the process
in which excess nutrients in alake or river cause algae togrow rapidly. Look up this termin a reference book or on theInternet. Is eutrophicationalways caused by humanaction?LanguageLINK
Canadians in Chemistry
John Charles Polanyi was born in Berlin,
Germany, into a family of Hungarian origin.Polanyi was born on the eve of the GreatDepression, shortly before the Nazi takeover. Hisfather moved to England to become a chemistryprofessor at Manchester University. Polanyi wassent to Canada for safety during the darkest yearsof World War II.
John Polanyi went back to England to earn a
doctorate in chemistry at Manchester Universityin 1952. He returned to Canada a few years later.Soon after, he took up a position at the Universityof Toronto. There Dr. Polanyi pursued theresearch that earned him a share of the NobelPrize for chemistry in 1986. He pioneered the ﬁeldof reaction dynamics, which addresses one of themost basic questions in chemistry: What happenswhen two substances interact to produce anothersubstance? Polanyi’s father had once investigatedthe same question.
Dr. Polanyi tried to provide some answers by
studying the very faint light that is given off bymolecules as they undergo chemical changes.This light is invisible to the unaided eye, becauseit is emitted in the infrared range of energy. It can
be detected, however, with the right instruments.Dr. Polanyi’s work led to the invention of the laser.As well, his research helped to explain what happens to energy during a chemical reaction.
Dr. Polanyi believes that people must accept
the responsibility that comes with scientiﬁcunderstanding and technological progress. Hebelieves, as well, that a vital element of hope lies at the heart of modern science. To Dr. Polanyi,human rights are integral to scientiﬁc success.“Science must breathe the oxygen of freedom,”he stated in 1999.
This is why Dr. Polanyi says that scientists
must take part in the debate on technological,social, and political affairs. Dr. Polanyi points to the political role played by scientists such as Andrei Sakharov in the former Soviet Union,Linus Pauling in the United States, and Fang Lizhiin China.
Make Connections
1.Research the scientists whom Dr. Polanyi mentioned: Andrei Sakharov, Linus Pauling,and Fang Lizhi. What work distinguished themas scientists? What work distinguished themas members of society?
2.Throughout history, chemists have laboured topresent the truth as they know it to their fellowscientists and to society. Some of them, suchas Linus Pauling, have been scorned andridiculed by the scientiﬁc community. Do fur-ther research to discover two other chemistswho have struggled to communicate theirideas, and have succeeded.
Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 9tive. Also, it would be expensive to develop other chemicals to do the
same job. After pressure from the government, detergent companiesreduced the amount of phosphate in their products by about 90%. Citieson Lake Erie spent millions of dollars adding phosphorus removal to theirwaste treatment. Today, Lake Erie has almost completely recovered.
The connection between technology (human-made chemical products) and the environment (Lake Erie) is an obvious STSE connection in this issue. What other connections do you see?
Section Wrap-up

Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 11As you can see in the photograph at the beginning of this chapter, water
is the most striking feature of our planet. It is visible from space, givingEarth a vivid blue colour. You can observe water above, below, and atEarth ’s surface. Water is a component of every living thing, from the
smallest bacterium to the largest mammal and the oldest tree. You drinkit, cook with it, wash with it, skate on it, and swim in it. Legends and stories involving water have been a part of every culture in human history. No other kind of matter is as essential to life as water.
In addition to water, there are millions of different kinds of matter in the
universe. The dust specks suspended in the air, the air itself, your chair,this textbook, your pen, your classmates, your teacher, and you —all these
are examples of matter. In the language of science, matter is anything that
has mass and volume (takes up space). In the rest of this chapter, you willexamine some key concepts related to matter. You have encountered theseconcepts in previous studies. Before you continue, complete the Checkpointactivity to see what you recall and how well you recall it. As you proceedthrough this chapter, assess and modify your answers.
Describing Matter
You must observe matter carefully to describe it well. When describingwater, for example, you may have used statements like these:•Water is a liquid.
•It has no smell.
•Water is clear and colourless.
•It changes to ice when it freezes.
•Water freezes at 0 ˚C.
•Sugar dissolves in water.
•Oil ﬂoats on water.
Characteristics that help you describe and identify matter are called
properties . Figure 1.2 on the next page shows some properties of water
and hydrogen peroxide. Examples of properties include physical state,colour, odour, texture, boiling temperature, density, and ﬂammability
(combustibility). Table 1.2 on the next page lists some common propertiesof matter. You will have direct experience with most of these propertiesduring this chemistry course.As refreshing as it may be, water straight from the tap seems ratherordinary. Try this: Describe a glass of water to someone who has neverseen or experienced water before. Be as detailed as possible. See howwell you can distinguish water from other kinds of matter.Describing and Measuring Matter
From memory, explain and
deﬁne each of the followingconcepts. Use descriptions,examples, labelled sketches,graphic organizers, a computerFAQs ﬁle or Help ﬁle, or anycombination of these. Return toyour answers frequently duringthis chapter. Modify them asnecessary.

12 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingTable 1.2 Common Properties of Matter
Properties may be physical or chemical. A physical property is a property
that you can observe without changing one kind of matter into somethingnew. For example, iron is a strong metal with a shiny surface. It is solid atroom temperature, but it can be heated and formed into different shapes.These properties can all be observed without changing iron into some-thing new.
A chemical property is a property that you can observe when one
kind of matter is converted into a different kind of matter. For example, achemical property of iron is that it reacts with oxygen to form a differentkind of matter: rust. Rust and iron have completely different physical andchemical properties.
Figure 1.3 shows another example of a chemical property. Glucose
test paper changes colour in the presence of glucose. Thus, a chemicalproperty of glucose test paper is that it changes colour in response to glucose. Similarly, a chemical property of glucose is that it changes thecolour of glucose test paper.
Recall that some properties of matter, such as colour, and ﬂammabili-
ty, are qualitative . You can describe them in words, but you cannot
measure them or express them numerically. Other properties, such as density and boiling point, can be measured and expressed numerically.Such properties are quantitative . In Investigation 1-A you will use both
qualitative and quantitative properties to examine a familiar item.
People with diabetes rely on a chemical property to help them monitor the
amount of glucose (a simple sugar) in their blood. Figure 1.3

14 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingUsing Measurements to Describe Matter
In the investigation, you measured the size and mass of a piece of alu-
minum foil. You have probably performed these types of measurementmany times before. Measurements are so much a part of your daily lifethat you can easily take them for granted. The clothes you wear come indifferent sizes. Much of the food you eat is sold by the gram, kilogram,millilitre, or litre. When you follow a recipe, you measure amounts. Thedimensions of paper and coins are made to exact speci ﬁcations. The value
of money is itself a measurement.
Measurements such as clothing size, amounts of food, and currency
are not standard, however. Clothing sizes in Europe are different fromthose in North America. European chefs tend to measure liquids and powdered solids by mass, rather than by volume. Currencies, of course,differ widely from country to country.
To communicate effectively, scientists rely on a standard system of
measurement. As you have learned in previous studies, this system iscalled the International System of Units (Le syst ème international
d’unités, SI). It allows scientists anywhere in the world to describe
matter in the same quantitative language. There are seven base SI units,and many more units that are derived from them. The metre (m), the kilogram (kg), and the second (s) are three of the base SI units. You willlearn about two more base units, the mole (mol) and the kelvin (K), laterin this book.
When you describe matter, you use terms such as mass, volume, and
temperature. When you measure matter, you use units such as grams,cubic centimetres, and degrees Celsius. Table 1.3 lists some quantities andunits that you will use often in this course. You are familiar with all ofthem except, perhaps, for the mole and the kelvin. The mole is one of themost important units for describing amounts of matter. You will be intro-duced to the mole in Unit 2. The kelvin is used to measure temperature.You will learn more about the kelvin scale in Unit 5. Consult Appendix Eif you would like to review other SI quantities and units.

Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 15Measurement and Uncertainty
Before you look more closely at matter, you need to know how much you
can depend on measurements. How can you recognize when a measure-ment is trustworthy? How can you tell if it is only an approximation? Forexample, there are ﬁve Great Lakes. Are you sure there are ﬁve? Is there
any uncertainty associated with the value “ﬁve” in this case? What about
the number of millilitres in 1 L, or the number of seconds in 1 min?Numbers such as these —numbers that you can count or numbers that are
true by de ﬁnition —are called exact numbers . You are certain that there
are ﬁve Great Lakes (or nine books on the shelf, or ten students in the
classroom) because you can count them. Likewise, you are certain thatthere are 1000 mL in 1 L, and 60 s in 1 min. These relationships are trueby de ﬁnition.
Now consider the numbers you used and the calculations you did in
Investigation 1-A. They are listed in Figure 1.4.Give ﬁve examples of exact
numbers that you have person-ally experienced today or overthe past few days.
IThe area of the aluminum
square measured 100 cm2
(10 cm ×10 cm).
IThe mass of the aluminum
square, as measured by anelectronic balance, mayhave been about 0.33 g.
IThe density of aluminum is 2.70 g/ cm
3at a given
temperature.
IThe thickness of the aluminum square, calculatedusing a calculator, may havebeen about 0.001 222 cm.Did you verify these dimensions?
Are you certain that each side measured exactly 10 cm? Could it have been 9.9 cm or 10.1 cm?
What reference did you use to find
the density? Did you consult more than one reference? Suppose that the density was actually 2.699 g/cm
3. Would this make a
difference in your calculations? Would this make a difference in the certainty of your answer?If you used an electronic
balance, are you certain that the digital read-out was accurate? Did the last digit fluctuate at all? If you used a triple-beam balance, are you certain that you read the correct value? Could it have been 0.34 g or 0.32 g?
Are you certain that this value
is fair, given the other values that you worked with? Is it fair to have such a precise value, with so many digits, when there are so few digits (just two: the 1 and the 0) in your dimensions of the aluminum square?
Numbers and calculations from Investigation 1-A Figure 1.4
16 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingDuring the investigations in this textbook, you will use equipment
such as rulers, balances, graduated cylinders, and thermometers to measure matter. You will calculate values with a calculator or with specially programmed software. How exact can your measurements andcalculations be? How exact should they be?
Two main factors affect your ability to record and communicate meas-
urements and calculations. One factor is the instruments you use. Theother factor is your ability to read and interpret what the instruments tellyou. Examine Figures 1.5 and 1.6. They will help you understand whichdigits you can know with certainty, and which digits are uncertain.
These two thermometers measure the same temperature.
Thermometer A is calibrated into divisions of 0.1 ˚C. Thermometer B is
calibrated into divisions of 1 ˚C. Which thermometer lets you make more
precise measurements? Which digits in each thermometer reading are you certain about? Which digits are you uncertain about?Figure 1.6
What is the length measured by ruler A? Is it 4.2 cm, or is it 4.3 cm? You
cannot be certain. The 2 of 4.2 is an estimate. The 3 of 4.3 is also an estimate. In both cases, therefore, you are uncertain about the last (farthest right) digit.
What is the length measured by ruler B? Is it 4.27 cm or 4.28 cm? Again, you
cannot be certain. Ruler B lets you make more precise measurements thanruler A. Despite ruler B’s higher precision, however, you must still estimatethe last digit. The 7 of 4.27 is an estimate. The 8 of 4.28 is also an estimate.cm

Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 17Signi ﬁcant Digits, Certainty, and Measurements
All measurements involve uncertainty. One source of this uncertainty
is the measuring device itself. Another source is your ability to perceiveand interpret a reading. In fact, you cannot measure anything with complete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement isalways an estimate.
The digits that you record when you measure something are called
signiﬁcant digits . Signi ﬁcant digits include the digits that you are certain
about anda ﬁnal, uncertain digit that you estimate. For example, 4.28 g
has three signi ﬁcant digits. The ﬁrst two digits, the 4 and the 2, are
certain. The last digit, the 8, is an estimate. Therefore, it is uncertain. The value 4.3 has two signi ﬁcant digits. The 4 is certain, and the 3 is
uncertain.
How Can You Tell Which Digits Are Signi ﬁcant?
You can identify the number of signi ﬁcant digits in any value. Table 1.4
lists some rules to help you do this.
Table 1.4 Rules for Determining Signi ﬁcant Digits
Explaining Five Signiﬁcant Digits
What if you were able to measure the volume of water in the Great Lakes?
You could verify the value of 22 700 km3. Then all ﬁve digits (including the
zeros) would be signi ﬁcant. Here again, scienti ﬁc notation lets you show
clearly the ﬁve signi ﬁcant digits: 2.2700×104km3.Explaining Three Signiﬁcant Digits
The Great Lakes contain 22 700 km3of water. Is there exactly that amount
of water in the Great Lakes? No, 22 700 km3is an approximate value. The
actual volume could be anywhere from 22 651 km3to 22 749 km3. You can
use scienti ﬁc notation to rewrite 22 700 km3as 2.27×104km. This shows
that only three digits are signi ﬁcant. (See Appendix E at the back of the
book, if you would like to review scienti ﬁc notation.)Rules Examples
7.886 has four significant digits.
19.4 has three significant digits.527.266 992 has nine significant digits.
408 has three significant digits.
25 074 has five significant digits.
0.0907 has three significant digits.
They are the 9, the third 0 to the right, and the 7. The function of the 0.0 at the begining is only to locate the decimal. 0.000 000 000 06 has one significant digit.1.All non-zero numbers
are significant.
2.All zeros that are located
between two non-zero numbersare significant.
3.Zeros that are located to the
left of a value are not significant.

or it may have five significant digits.

Accuracy and Precision
In everyday speech, you might use the terms “accuracy ” and “precision ”
to mean the same thing. In science, however, these terms are related tocertainty. Each, then, has a speci ﬁc meaning.
Accuracy refers to how close a given quantity is to an accepted or
expected value. (See Figure 1.7.) Precision may refer to the exactness of a
measurement. For example, ruler B in Figure 1.5 lets you measure lengthwith greater precision than ruler A. Precision may also refer to the close-ness of a series of data points. Data that are very close to one another aresaid to be precise. Examine Figure 1.8. Notice that a set of data can be precise but not accurate.
Under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, 5 mL of water has a
mass of 5 g. Why does the reading on this balance show a different value?Figure 1.7

20 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingTable 1.5 Rules for Reporting Signi ﬁcant Digits in Calculations
Rule 3: Rounding
To get the appropriate number of signi ﬁcant digits (rule 1) or decimal
places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer.
If your answer ends in a number that is greater than 5, increase the
preceding digit by 1. For example, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35.
If your answer ends with a number that is less than 5, leave the preceding
number unchanged. For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7.
If your answer ends with 5, increase the preceding number by 1 if it is odd.
Leave the preceding number unchanged if it is even. For example, 18.35can be rounded to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded to 18.2.Rule 2: Adding and SubtractingThe value with the fewest number of decimal places, going into the calculation, determines the number of decimal places that you shouldreport in your answer.Rule 1: Multiplying and DividingThe value with the fewest number of signi ﬁcant digits, going into the
calculation, determines the number of signi ﬁcant digits that you should
report in your answer.Calculating with Signi ﬁcant Digits
In this course, you will often take measurements and use them to calcu-
late other quantities. You must be careful to keep track of which digitsin your calculations and results are signi ﬁcant. Why? Your results
should not imply more certainty than your measured quantities justify.This is especially important when you use a calculator. Calculatorsusually report results with far more ﬁgures —greater certainty —than
your data warrant. Always remember that calculators do not make decisions about certainty. You do.
There are three rules for reporting signi ﬁcant digits in calculated
answers. These rules are summarized in Table 1.5. Re ﬂect on how they
apply to your previous experiences. Then examine the SampleProblems that follow.
Problem
A student measured a regularly shaped sample of iron and found itto be 6.78 cm long, 3.906 cm wide, and 11 cm tall. Determine its volume to the correct number of signi ﬁcant digits.
What Is Required?
You need to calculate the volume of the iron sample. Then you need
to write this volume using the correct number of signi ﬁcant digits.Sample Problem

Chapter 1  Observing Matter • MHR 21What Is Given?
You know the three dimensions of the iron sample.
Length =6.78 cm (three signi ﬁcant digits)
Width =3.906 cm (four signi ﬁcant digits)
Height =11 cm (two signi ﬁcant digits)
Plan Your Strategy
To calculate the volume, use the formula
Volume =Length×Width×Height
V=l×w×h
Find the value with the smallest number of signi ﬁcant digits. Your
answer can have only this number of signi ﬁcant digits.
Act on Your Strategy
V=l×w×h
=6.78 cm ×3.906 cm ×11 cm
=291.309 48 cm3
The value 11 cm has the smallest number of signi ﬁcant digits: two.
Thus, your answer can have only two signi ﬁcant digits. In order to
have only two signi ﬁcant digits, you need to put your answer into
scienti ﬁc notation.
V=2.9×102cm3
Therefore, the volume is 2.9×102cm3, to two signi ﬁcant digits.

Air Canada Flight 143
Air Canada Flight 143 was en route from
Montr éal to Edmonton on July 23, 1983. The
airplane was one of Air Canada ’s ﬁrst Boeing
767s, and its systems were almost completelycomputerized.
While on the ground in Montr éal, Captain
Robert Pearson found that the airplane ’s fuel
processor was malfunctioning. As well, allthree fuel gauges were not operating. Pearsonbelieved, however, that it was safe to ﬂy the
airplane using manual fuel measurements.
Partway into the ﬂight, as the airplane
passed over Red Lake, Ontario, one of two fuelpumps in the left wing failed. Soon the otherfuel pump failed and the left engine ﬂamed
out. Pearson decided to head to the closestmajor airport, in Winnipeg. He began the airplane ’s descent. At 8400 m, and more than
160 km from the Winnipeg Airport, the rightengine also failed. The airplane had run out of fuel.
In Montr éal, the ground crew had deter-
mined that the airplane had 7682 L of fuel inits fuel tank. Captain Pearson had calculatedthat the mass of fuel needed for the trip fromMontr éal to Edmonton was 22 300 kg. Since
fuel is measured in litres, Pearson asked amechanic how to convert litres into kilograms.He was told to multiply the amount in litres by 1.77.By multiplying 7682 L by 1.77, Pearson
calculated that the airplane had 13 597 kg offuel on board. He subtracted this value fromthe total amount of fuel for the trip, 22 300 kg,and found that 8703 kg more fuel was needed.
To convert kilograms back into litres,
Pearson divided the mass, 8703 kg, by 1.77.The result was 4916 L. The crew added 4916 Lof fuel to the airplane ’s tanks.
This conversion number, 1.77, had been
used in the past because the density of jet fuelis 1.77 pounds per litre. Unfortunately, the
number that should have been used to convertlitres into kilograms was 0.803. The crewshould have added 20 088 L of fuel, not 4916 L.
First of ﬁcer Maurice Quintal calculated
their rate of descent. He determined that theywould never make Winnipeg. Pearson turnednorth and headed toward Gimli, an abandonedAir Force base. Gimli ’s left runway was being
used for drag-car and go-kart races.Surrounding the runway were families andcampers. It was into this situation that Pearsonand Quintal landed the airplane.
Tires blew upon impact. The airplane skid-
ded down the runway as racers and spectatorsscrambled to get out of the way. Flight 143ﬁnally came to rest 1200 m later, a mere 30 m
from the dazed onlookers.
Miraculously no one was seriously injured.
As news spread around the world, the airplanebecame known as “The Gimli Glider. ”

Matter is constantly changing. Plants grow by converting matter from
the soil and air into matter they can use. Water falls from the sky, evapo-rates, and condenses again to form liquid water in a never-ending cycle.You can probably suggest many more examples of matter changing.
Matter changes in response to changes in energy. Adding energy to
matter or removing energy from matter results in a change. Figure 1.9shows a familiar example of a change involving matter and energy.
Like all matter, water can change its state when energy is added or removed.
Physical and Chemical Changes in Matter
A change of state alters the appearance of matter. The composition of matter remains the same, however, regardless of its state. For example, ice,liquid water, and water vapour are all the same kind of matter: water.Melting and boiling other kinds of matter have the same result. Theappearance and some other physical properties change, but the matterretains its identity —its composition. Changes that affect the physical
appearance of matter, but notits composition, are physical changes .
Figure 1.10 shows a different kind of change involving water.
Electrical energy is passed through water, causing it to decompose. Twocompletely different kinds of matter result from this process: hydrogen gasand oxygen gas. These gases have physical and chemical properties thatare different from the properties of water and from each other ’s properties.
Therefore, decomposing water is a change that affects the composition ofwater. Changes that alter the composition of matter are called chemical
changes . Iron rusting, wood burning, and bread baking are three examples
of chemical changes.
You learned about physical and chemical properties earlier in this
chapter. A physical change results in a change of physical properties only. A chemical change results in a change of both physical and chemical properties.Figure 1.9

Classifying Matter
All matter can be classi ﬁed into two groups: mixtures and pure sub-
stances. A mixture is a physical combination of two or more kinds of
matter. For example, soil is a mixture of sand, clay, silt, and decom-posed leaves and animal bodies. If you look at soil under a magnifyingglass, you can see these different components. Figure 1.11 shows another way to see the components of soil.
The components in a mixture can occur in different proportions
(relative quantities). Each individual component retains its identity.Mixtures in which the different components are clearly visible arecalled heterogeneous mixtures . The pre ﬁx “hetero- ” comes from the
Greek word heteros , meaning “different. ”
Mixtures in which the components are blended together so well
that the mixture looks like just one substance are called homogeneous
mixtures . The pre ﬁx “homo- ” comes from the Greek word homos ,
meaning “the same. ” Saltwater, clean air, and grape juice are common
examples. Homogeneous mixtures are also called solutions. You willinvestigate solutions in Unit 3.
A pure substance has a de ﬁnite composition, which stays the same
in response to physical changes. A lump of copper is a pure substance.Water (with nothing dissolved in it) is also a pure substance. Diamond,carbon dioxide, gold, oxygen, and aluminum are pure substances, too.
Pure substances are further classi ﬁed into elements and com-
pounds. An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated
chemically into any simpler substances. Copper, zinc, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon are examples of elements.
A compound is a pure substance that results when two or more
elements combine chemically to form a different substance.Compounds can be broken down into elements using chemical process-es. For example, carbon dioxide is a compound. It can be separated intothe elements carbon and oxygen. The Concept Organizer on the nextpage outlines the classi ﬁcation of matter at a glance. The ThoughtLab
reinforces your understanding of properties, mixtures, and separationof substances. Before adopting the metric
system, Canadians measuredtemperature in units calledFahrenheit degrees ( ˚F). Based
on the Fahrenheit scale, waterboils at 212 ˚F and freezes at
32˚F. A few countries, including
the United States, still use the Fahrenheit scale. Withoutchecking any reference materials, design a method for converting Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures, and back again.Show your work, and explainyour reasoning.
To see the
components of soil, add some soil to a glass of water. Whatproperty is responsible for separating the components?Figure 1.11
The word “pure ” can be used

You frequently use your knowledge of properties
to make and separate mixtures and substances.You probably do this most often in the kitchen.Even the act of sorting clean laundry, however,depends on your ability to recognize and makeuse of physical properties. This activity is a“thought experiment. ” You will use your under-
standing of properties to mix and separate a variety of chemicals, all on paper. Afterward, your teacher may ask you to test your ideas,either in the laboratory or at home in the kitchen.
Procedure
1.Consider the following chemicals: table salt,water, baking soda, sugar, iron ﬁlings, sand,
vegetable oil, milk, and vinegar. Identify eachchemical as a mixture or a pure substance.
2.Which of these chemicals can you mix together without producing a chemical
change? In your notebook, record as many of these physical combinations as you can.
3.Which of these chemicals can you mix together to produce a chemical change?Record as many of these chemical combinations as you can.4.Record a mixture that is made with four of the chemicals. Then suggest one or more techniques that you can use to separate thefour chemicals from one another. Write notesand sketch labelled diagrams to show yourtechniques. Identify the properties that yourtechniques depend on.
Analysis
1.In step 2, what properties of the chemicals didyou use to determine your combinations?
2.In step 3, what properties did you use to determine your combinations?
Application
3.Exchange your four-chemical mixture with a partner. Do not include your notes and diagrams. Challenge your partner to suggesttechniques to separate the four chemicals.Then assess each other ’s techniques. What
modi ﬁcations, if any, would you make to
your original techniques?Mixtures, Pure Substances, and Changes Thought Lab
28 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingSection Wrap-up
Notice that the classi ﬁcation system for matter, shown in the Concept
Organizer, is based mainly on the changes that matter undergoes: •physical changes to separate mixtures into elements or compounds
•chemical changes to convert compounds or elements into different
compounds or elements
To explain how and why these chemical changes occur, you must look
“deeper ” into matter. You must look at its composition. This is what you
will do in the next chapter. You will see how examining the compositionof matter leads to a different classi ﬁcation system: the periodic table. You
will also see how the periodic table allows chemists to make predictionsabout the properties and behaviour of matter.
Copy Figure 1.9 into your notebook. Add the following labels in the
appropriate places: evaporation, condensation, melting, freezing, solid-ifying. Note: Some labels may apply to the same places on the diagram.
You may recall that sublimation is a change of state in which a
solid changes directly into a gas. The reverse is also true. Add the label“sublimation ” to your diagram for question 1. Include arrows to show
the addition or removal of energy.

Today, if you want to travel by air across the country or overseas, you
take an airplane. During the ﬁrst three decades of the twentieth century,you would have boarded a hydrogen-ﬁlled balloon such as the one shownin the black-and-white photograph. Large and small airships such asthese, called dirigibles, were common sights in the skies above manyNorth American and European cities. Unfortunately, during a landing inLakehurst, New Jersey in 1937, the hydrogen in one of these airships, theHindenburg, ignited. The resulting explosion killed 36 people, and
marked the end of the use of hydrogen for dirigibles.
Gas-ﬁlled airships and balloons like the one shown in the colour pho-
tograph now use helium gas instead of hydrogen. Helium, unlike hydro-gen, does not burn. In fact, helium is a highly unreactive gas. What is itabout hydrogen that makes it so reactive? Why is helium so unreactive?The answer lies in the structure of the atoms of these elements. In previ-ous science courses, you traced the history of our understanding of atomsand their structure. You also learned how chemists use properties toarrange elements, and the atoms of which they are made, into a remark-able tool called the periodic table. This chapter highlights and expands onkey ideas from your earlier studies. By the end of the chapter, you willhave a greater understanding of the properties of elements at an atomiclevel. This understanding is a crucial foundation for concepts that youwill explore in your chemistry course this year.

Specific Expectations  Elements are the basic substances that make up all matter. About 90
elements exist naturally in the universe. The two smallest and least denseof these elements are hydrogen and helium. Yet hydrogen and heliumaccount for nearly 98% of the mass of the entire universe!
Here on Earth, there is very little hydrogen in its pure elemental form.
There is even less helium. In fact, there is such a small amount of heliumon Earth that it escaped scientists’ notice until 1895.
Regardless of abundance, any two samples of hydrogen —from
anywhere on Earth or far beyond in outer space — are identical to eachother. For example, a sample of hydrogen from Earth’s atmosphere is iden-tical to a sample of hydrogen from the Sun. The same is true for helium.This is because each element is made up of only a single kind of atom .
For example, the element hydrogen contains only hydrogen atoms. The element helium contains only helium atoms. What, however, is an atom?
The Atomic Theory of Matter
John Dalton was a British teacher and self-taught scientist. In 1809, hedescribed atoms as solid, indestructible particles that make up all matter.(See Figure 2.1.) Dalton’s concept of the atom is one of several ideas in his atomic theory of matter, which is outlined on the next page. Keep inmind that scientists have modiﬁed several of Dalton’s ideas, based on laterdiscoveries. You will learn about these modiﬁcations at the end of thissection. See if you can infer what some of them are as you study the struc-ture of the atom on the next few pages.
This illustration shows an atom as John Dalton (1766–1844) imagined it.
Many reference materials refer to Dalton’s concept of the atom as the “billiard ballmodel.” Dalton, however, was an avid lawn bowler. His concept of the atom was almostcertainly inﬂuenced by the smooth, solid bowling balls used in the game.Figure 2.1
Atoms and Their Composition
How scientists visualize the
atom has changed greatlysince Dalton proposed hisatomic theory in the early nine-teenth century. Technology hasplayed an essential role inthese changes. At a library oron the Internet, research thekey modiﬁcations to the modelof the atom. Create a summarychart to show your ﬁndings.Include the scientists involved,the technologies they used, thediscoveries they made, and theimpact of their discoveries onthe model of the atom.

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 35The Modern View of the Atom
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still retains the identi-
ty and properties of the element. For example, the smallest particle of thewriting material in your pencil is a carbon atom. (Pencil “lead” is actuallya substance called graphite. Graphite is a form of the element carbon.)
An average atom is about 10
−10m in diameter. Such a tiny size is
difﬁcult to visualize. If an average atom were the size of a grain of sand, a strand of your hair would be about 60 m in diameter!
Atoms themselves are made up of even smaller particles. These
subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and
neutrons cluster together to form the central core, or nucleus , of an atom.
Fast-moving electrons occupy the space that surrounds the nucleus of the atom. As their names imply, subatomic particles are associated withelectrical charges. Table 2.1 and Figure 2.2 summarize the general featuresand properties of an atom and its three subatomic particles.
Table 2.1 Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons
Expressing the Mass of Subatomic Particles
As you can see in Table 2.1, subatomic particles are incredibly small.
Suppose that you could count out protons or neutrons equal to
602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (or 6.02×1023)
and put them on a scale. They would have a mass of about 1 g. Thismeans that one proton or neutron has a mass of
1g
6.02×1023=0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001 66 g
=1.66×10−24g
It is inconvenient to measure the mass of subatomic particles using units
such as grams. Instead, chemists use a unit called an atomic mass unit
(symbol u). A proton has a mass of about 1 u, which is equal to
1.66×10−24g.
This illustration shows the modern view of an atom. Notice that a fuzzy,
cloud-like region surrounds the atomic nucleus. Electrons move rapidly throughout thisregion, which represents most of the atom’s volume.Figure 2.2Subatomic particle Charge Symbol Mass (in g) Radius (in m)

•All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. An atom
cannot be created, destroyed, or divided into smaller particles.
•The atoms of one element cannot be converted into the atoms of
any another element.
•All the atoms of one element have the same properties, such as
mass and size. These properties are different from the properties of the atoms of any other element.
•Atoms of different elements combine in speci ﬁc proportions to
form compounds.The atomic theory was a
convincing explanation of the behaviour of matter. Itexplained two established scientiﬁc laws: the law of conservation of mass and thelaw of deﬁnite composition.
•Law of conservation ofmass : During a chemical
reaction, the total mass ofthe substances involveddoes not change.
•Law of deﬁnite proportion : Elements
always combine to formcompounds in ﬁxed proportions by mass. (For example, pure wateralways contains the elements hydrogen andoxygen, combined in thefollowing proportions: 11% hydrogen and 89%oxygen.)

36 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingThe Nucleus of an Atom
All the atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons
in their nucleus. For example, all hydrogen atoms —anywhere in the
universe —have one proton. All helium atoms have two protons. All
oxygen atoms have eight protons. Chemists use the term atomic number
(symbol Z) to refer to the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom
of an element.
As you know, the nucleus of an atom also contains neutrons. In fact,
the mass of an atom is due to the combined masses of its protons and neutrons. Therefore, an element ’s mass number (symbol A) is the total
number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of one of its atoms. Eachproton or neutron is counted as one unit of the mass number. For exam-ple, an oxygen atom, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its nucleus,has a mass number of 16. A uranium atom, which has 92 protons and 146 neutrons, has a mass number of 238.
Information about an element ’s protons and neutrons is often
summarized using the chemical notation shown in Figure 2.3. The letter Xrepresents the atomic symbol for an element. (The atomic symbol is also
called the element symbol .) Each element has a different atomic symbol.
All chemists, throughout the world, use the same atomic symbols. Overthe coming months, you will probably learn to recognize many of thesesymbols instantly. Appendix G, at the back of this book, lists the elementsin alphabetical order, along with their symbols. You can also ﬁnd the ele-
ments and their symbols in the periodic table on the inside back cover ofthis textbook, and in Appendix C. (You will review and extend yourunderstanding of the periodic table, in section 2.2.)
Notice what the chemical notation in Figure 2.3 does, and does not,
tell you about the structure of an element ’s atoms. For example, consider
the element ﬂuorine:
19
9F. The mass number (the superscript 19) indicates
that ﬂuorine has a total of 19 protons and neutrons. The atomic number
(subscript 9) indicates that ﬂuorine has 9 protons. Neither the mass num-
ber nor the atomic number tells you how many neutrons ﬂuorine has. You
can calculate this value, however, by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number.

A proton is about 1837 times
more massive than an elec-tron. According to Table 2.1,the mass of an electron is
9.02×10
−28g. This value is so
small that scientists considerthe mass of an electron to beapproximately equal to zero.Thus, electrons are not takeninto account when calculatingthe mass of an atom.FACTCHEM

Now try a few similar calculations in the Practice Problem below. Expressing numerical data
about atoms in units such asmetres is like using a bulldozerto move a grain of sand. Atomsand subatomic particles are so small that they are notmeasured using familiar units.Instead, chemists often meas-ure atoms in nanometres(1n m=1×10

Using the Atomic Number to Infer the Number of Electrons
As just mentioned, the atomic number and mass number do not give you
direct information about the number of neutrons in an element. They donot give you the number of electrons, either. You can infer the number ofelectrons, however, from the atomic number. The atoms of each elementare electrically neutral. This means that their positive charges (protons)and negative charges (electrons) must balance one another. In other words,in the neutral atom of any element, the number of protons is equal to thenumber of electrons . For example, a neutral hydrogen atom contains one
proton, so it must also contain one electron. A neutral oxygen atom con-tains eight protons, so it must contain eight electrons.
Isotopes and Atomic Mass
All neutral atoms of the same element contain the same number of protons and, therefore, the same number of electrons. The number of neutrons can vary, however. For example, most of the oxygen atoms innature have eight neutrons in their atomic nuclei. In other words, mostoxygen atoms have a mass number of 16 (8 protons +8 neutrons). As you
can see in Figure 2.4 on the next page, there are also two other naturallyoccurring forms of oxygen. One of these has nine neutrons, so A=17. The
other has ten neutrons, so A=18. These three forms of oxygen are called
isotopes. Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the same number of
protons but different numbers of neutrons.
38 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingThe isotopes of an element have very similar chemical properties because
they have the same number of protons and electrons. They differ in mass,however, because they have different numbers of neutrons.
Some isotopes are more unstable than others. Their nuclei (plural
of nucleus ) are more likely to decay, releasing energy and subatomic
particles. This process, called radioactivity , happens spontaneously.
All uranium isotopes, for example, have unstable nuclei. They are calledradioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes for short. Many isotopes are not
radioisotopes. Oxygen ’s three naturally occurring isotopes, for example,
are stable. In contrast, chemists have successfully synthesized ten otherisotopes of oxygen, all of which are unstable radioisotopes. (What prod-ucts result when radioisotopes decay? You will ﬁnd out in Chapter 4.)
Electrons in Atoms
So far, much of the discussion about the atom has concentrated on the
nucleus and its protons and neutrons. What about electrons? What is theirimportance to the atom? Recall that electrons occupy the space surround-ing the nucleus. Therefore, they are the ﬁrst subatomic particles that are
likely to interact when atoms come near one another. In a way, electronsare on the “front lines ” of atomic interactions. The number and arrange-
ment of the electrons in an atom determine how the atom will react, if atall, with other atoms. As you will learn in section 2.2, and throughout therest of this unit, electrons are responsible for the chemical properties ofthe elements.
Revisiting the Atomic Theory
John Dalton did not know about subatomic particles when he developedhis atomic theory. Even so, the modern atomic theory (shown on the nextpage) retains many of Dalton ’s ideas, with only a few modi ﬁcations.
Examine the comments to the right of each point. They explain how themodern theory differs from Dalton ’s.
The atomic theory is a landmark achievement in the history of
chemistry. It has shaped the way that all scientists, especially chemists,think about matter. In the next section, you will investigate another landmark achievement in chemistry: the periodic table.Radioisotopes decay because
their nuclei are unstable. Thetime it takes for nuclei to decayvaries greatly. For example, ittakes billions of years for onlyhalf of the nucleus of naturallyoccurring uranium-238 todecay. The nuclei of otherradioisotopes — mainly thosethat scientists have synthe-sized — decay much more rapidly. The nuclei of some isotopes, such as sodium-22,take about 20 years to decay.For calcium-47, this decayoccurs in a matter of days. Thenuclei of most syntheticradioisotopes decay so quickly,however, that the radioiso-topes exist for mere fractionsof a second.FACTCHEM
When chemists refer symboli-
cally to oxgyen-16 atoms, theyoften leave out the atomicnumber. They write
16O. You
can write other isotopes ofoxygen, and all other elements,the same way. Why is itacceptable to leave out theatomic number?Oxygen has three
naturally occurring isotopes.Notice that oxygen-16 has thesame meaning as
16

oxygen-17 has the same meaningas

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 39The Modern Atomic Theory
•All matter is made up of tiny particles called
atoms. Each atom is made up of smaller subatomicparticles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.
•The atoms of one element cannot be converted
into the atoms of any another element by achemical reaction.
•Atoms of one element have the same properties,
such as average mass and size. These propertiesare different from the properties of the atoms ofany other element.
•Atoms of different elements combine in speci ﬁc
proportions to form compounds.
Not all chemists believed
that Dalton’s atoms existed. In1877, one skeptical scientist called Dalton’s atoms “stupidhallucinations.” Other scien-tists considered atoms to be a valuable idea for understand-
ing matter and its behaviour.They did not, however, believethat atoms had any physicalreality. The discovery of electrons (and, later, the othersubatomic particles) ﬁnallyconvinced scientists thatatoms are more than simply an idea. Atoms, they realized,must be matter.FACTCHEMAlthough an atom is divisible, it is still the
smallest particle of an element that has the properties and identity of the element.
Nuclear reactions (changes that alter the
composition of the atomic nucleus) may, in fact, convert atoms of one element into atoms of another.
Different isotopes of an element have
different numbers of neutrons and thus different masses. As you will learn in Chapter 5, scientists treat elements as if their atoms have an average mass.
This idea has remained basically
unchanged.

Specific Expectations  By the mid 1800 ’s, there were 65 known elements. Chemists studied these
elements intensively and recorded detailed information about their reac-tivity and the masses of their atoms. Some chemists began to recognizepatterns in the properties and behaviour of many of these elements. (SeeFigure 2.5.)
Other sets of elements display similar trends in their properties and
behaviour. For example, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te) share similar properties. The same is true of ﬂuorine (F),
chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I). These similarities promptedchemists to search for a fundamental property that could be used to organize all the elements. One chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834 –1907),
sequenced the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass. Theresult was a table of the elements, organized so that elements with similarproperties were arranged in the same column. Because Mendeleev ’s
arrangement highlighted periodic (repeating) patterns of properties, it wascalled a periodic table .
The modern periodic table is a modi ﬁcation of the arrangement ﬁrst
proposed by Mendeleev. Instead of organizing elements according toatomic mass, the modern periodic table organizes elements according toatomic number. According to the periodic law ,the chemical and physical
properties of the elements repeat in a regular, periodic pattern when theyare arranged according to their atomic number.
Figures 2.6 and 2.7 outline the key features of the modern periodic
table. Take some time to review these features. Another version of theperiodic table, containing additional data, appears on the inside backcover of this textbook, as well as in Appendix C.Atoms, Elements,
and the Periodic Table
The term periodic means
“repeating in an identi ﬁable
pattern. ” For example, a calen-
dar is periodic. It organizes the days of the months into arepeating series of weeks.What other examples of periodicity can you think of?LanguageLINK

IElements are arranged in sevennumbered periods (horizontalrows) and 18 numbered groups(vertical columns).
IGroups are numbered accordingto two different systems. Thecurrent system numbers thegroups from 1 to 18. An oldersystem numbers the groupsfrom I to VIII, and separates theminto two categories labelled Aand B. Both of these systems are included in this textbook.
IThe elements in the eight Agroups are the main-group elements. They are also called the representative elements. The elements in the ten B groups
are known as the transition elements. (In older periodictables, Roman numerals areused to number the A and Bgroups.)
IWithin the B group transition elements are two horizontalseries of elements called innertransition elements. They usuallyappear below the main periodictable. Notice, however, that theyﬁt between the elements in
Group 3 (IIIB) and Group 4 (IVB).
IA bold “staircase ” line runs from
the top of Group 13 (IIIA) to thebottom of Group 16 (VIA). Thisline separates the elements into three broad classes: metals,metalloids (or semi-metals), and non-metals. (See Figure 2.7on the next page for more information.)IGroup 1 (IA) elements are knownas alkali metals . They react with
water to form alkaline, or basic,solutions.
IGroup 2 (IIA) elements areknown as alkaline earth metals .
They react with oxygen to formcompounds called oxides, whichreact with water to form alkalinesolutions. Early chemists calledall metal oxides “earths. ”
IGroup 17 (VIIA) elements are
known as halogens , from the
Greek word hals, meaning
“salt.” Elements in this group
combine with other elements toform compounds called salts.
IGroup 18 (VIIIA) elements areknown as noble gases . Noble
gases do not combine in naturewith any other elements.MAIN-GROUP

Electrons and the Periodic Table
You have seen how the periodic table organizes elements so that those
with similar properties are in the same group. You have also seen how the periodic table distinguishes among metals, non-metals, and metalloids.Other details of the organization of the periodic table may seem baf ﬂing,
however. Why, for example, are there different numbers of elements in the periods?
The reason for this, and other details of the periodic table ’s organiza-
tion, involves the number and arrangement of electrons in the atoms ofeach element. To appreciate the importance of electrons to the periodictable, it is necessary to revisit the structure of the atom.
In the following ExpressLab, you will observe elements in much the
same way that scientists did in the early twentieth century. In doing so,these scientists set the stage for a new understanding of matter and theelectrical structure of its atoms.2.Identify the name and symbol of the elements in the following loca-tions of the periodic table:

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 43Electrons and Energy Levels
Electrons cannot move haphazardly. Their
movement around an atomic nucleus is restrictedto ﬁxed regions of space. These regions are three-
dimensional, similar to the layers of an onion.
Figure 2.8 shows a representation of these
regions. Keep in mind that they are notsolid.
They are volumes of space in which electrons maybe found. You may have heard these regionscalled energy shells or shells. In this textbook,
they are called energy levels . An electron that
is moving in a lower energy level is close to thenucleus. It has less energy than it would if it were moving in a higher energy level.In this activity, you will use a device called a
diffraction grating . It separates light into banded
patterns of colour (a spectrum). Different coloursof light have different frequencies and wave-lengths, so they have different amounts of energy. Red light is less energetic, for example,than blue light.
Safety Precautions
•Gas discharge tubes operate at a voltage that ishigh enough to cause serious injury. Observethem only from a safe distance, as determinedby your teacher.
Materials
diffraction gratingincandescent light sourcegas discharge tubes containing different elements
Procedure
1.Use the diffraction grating to observe the lightthat is emitted from an ordinary incandescentlight bulb. Make a quick sketch to record yourobservations.
2.Observe the light that is emitted from thehydrogen gas discharge tube. Youshould be about 1 m from the discharge tube.Come no farther than your teacher directs.Sketch your observations.3.Observe the light that is emitted from the discharge tubes of other elements. Sketchyour observations for each element.
Analysis
1.If the electrons in a discharge tube are movingeverywhere in the space around the nucleus,their spectrum should look like the spectrumof an ordinary light bulb. What does hydro-gen’s spectrum look like? How do the spectra
of the other elements compare with the spectrum of a light bulb and the spectrum of hydrogen?
2.Hydrogen has only one electron. Why, then,does its spectrum have four coloured lines?
3.Why is the light that is emitted by hydrogendifferent from the light that is emitted by the other elements? Explain the difference in terms of electrons.
Application
4.What do gas discharge tubes have in commonwith street lights? Do research to ﬁnd out
which gases are used in street lamps, and whycertain gases are chosen for certain locations.

44 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingThere is a limit to the number of electrons that can occupy each ener-
gy level. For example, a maximum of two electrons can occupy the ﬁrst
energy level. A maximum of eight electrons can occupy the second energylevel. The periodic trends (repeating patterns) that result from organizing
the elements by their atomic number are linked to the way in which electrons occupy and ﬁll energy levels. (See Figure 2.9.)
As shown in Figure 2.9A, a common way to show the arrangement of
electrons in an atom is to draw circles around the atomic symbol. Eachcircle represents an energy level. Dots represent electrons that occupyeach energy level. This kind of diagram is called a Bohr-Rutherford dia-gram. It is named after two scientists who contributed their insights to theatomic theory.
Figure 2.9B shows that the ﬁrst energy level is full when two electrons
occupy it. Only two elements have two or fewer electrons: hydrogen andhelium. Hydrogen has one electron, and helium has two. These elements,with their electrons in the ﬁrst energy level, make up Period 1 of the
periodic table.
As you can see in Figure 2.9C, Period 2 elements have two occupied
energy levels. The second energy level is full when eight electrons occupyit. Neon, with a total of ten electrons, has its ﬁrst and second energy levels
ﬁlled. Notice how the second energy level ﬁlls with electrons as you move
across the period from lithium to ﬂuorine.

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 45Patterns Based on Energy Levels and Electron Arrangements
The structure of the periodic table is closely related to energy levels and
the arrangement of electrons. Two important patterns result from this relationship. One involves periods, and the other involves groups.
The Period-Related Pattern
As you can see in Figure 2.9, elements in Period 1 have electrons in one
energy level. Elements in Period 2 have electrons in two energy levels.This pattern applies to all seven periods. An element’s period number is
the same as the number of energy levels that the electrons of its atomsoccupy. Thus, you could predict that Period 5 elements have electrons
that occupy ﬁve energy levels. This is, in fact, true.
What about the inner transition elements —the elements that are
below the periodic table? Figure 2.10 shows how this pattern applies tothem. Elements 58 through 71 belong in Period 6, so their electrons occupy six energy levels. Elements 90 through 103 belong in Period 7, sotheir electrons occupy seven energy levels. Chemists and chemical tech-nologists tend to use only a few of the inner transition elements (notablyuranium and plutonium) on a regular basis. Thus, it is more convenient toplace all the inner transition elements below the periodic table.
The “long form ” of the periodic table includes the inner transition metals
in their proper place.
The Group-Related Pattern
The second pattern emerges when you consider the electron arrangements
in the main-group elements: the elements in Groups 1 (IA), 2 (IIA), and 13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA). All the elements in each main group have the samenumber of electrons in their highest (outer) energy level. The electronsthat occupy the outer energy level are called valence electrons . The term
“valence ” comes from a Latin word that means “to be strong. ” “Valence
electrons ” is a suitable name because the outer energy level electrons are
the electrons involved when atoms form compounds. In other words,valence electrons are responsible for the chemical behaviour of elements.Figure 2.101

46 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingYou can infer the number of valence electrons in any main-group
element from its group number. For example, Group 1 (IA) elements haveone valence electron. Group 2 (IIA) elements have two valence electrons.For elements in Groups 13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA), the number of valence electrons is the same as the second digit in the current numbering system.It is the same as the only digit in the older numbering system. For exam-ple, elements in Group 15 (VA) have 5 valence electrons. The elements inGroup 17 (VIIA) have 7 valence electrons.
Using Lewis Structures to Represent Valence Electrons
It is time-consuming to draw electron arrangements using Bohr-Rutherforddiagrams. It is much simpler to use Lewis structures to represent elements
and the valence electrons of their atoms. To draw a Lewis structure, youreplace the nucleus and inner energy levels of an atom with its atomicsymbol. Then you place dots around the atomic symbol to represent thevalence electrons. The order in which you place the ﬁrst four dots
is up to you. You may ﬁnd it simplest to start at the top and proceed
clockwise: right, then bottom, then left.
Examine Figure 2.11, and then complete the Practice Problems that
follow. In Chapter 3, you will use Lewis structures to help you visualizewhat happens when atoms combine to form compounds.
Examine these Lewis structures for the Period 2 elements. Place a dot on
each side of the element —one dot for each valence electron. Then start pairing dots
when you reach ﬁve or more valence electrons.Figure 2.11Li Be B C N O F Ne

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 47The Signi ﬁcance of a Full Outer Energy Level
The noble gases in Group 18 (VIIIA) are the only elements that exist as
individual atoms in nature. They are extremely unreactive. They do not
naturally form compounds with other atoms. (Scientists have manipulated
several of these elements in the laboratory to make them react, however.)What is it about the noble gases that explains this behaviour?
Recall that chemical reactivity is determined by valence electrons.
Thus, there must be something about the arrangement of the electrons inthe noble gases that explains their unreactivity. All the noble gases have
outer energy levels that are completely ﬁlled with the maximum number
of electrons. Helium has a full outer energy level of two valence electrons.The other noble gases have eight valence electrons in the outer energylevel. Chemists reason that having a full outer energy level must be a verystable electron arrangement.
What does this stability mean? It means that a full outer energy level
is unlikely to change. Scientists have observed that, in nature, situationsor systems of lower energy are favoured over situations or systems ofhigher energy. For example, a book on a high shelf has more potentialenergy (is less stable) than a book on a lower shelf. If you move a bookfrom a high shelf to a lower shelf, it has less potential energy (is more stable). If you move a book to the ﬂoor, it has low potential energy
(is much more stable).
When atoms have eight electrons in the outer energy level (or two
electrons for hydrogen and helium), chemists say that they have a stable octet . Often this term is shortened to just octet . An octet is a very
stable electron arrangement. As you will see in Chapter 3, an octet is often the result of changes in which atoms combine to form compounds.
Section Wrap-up
You have seen that the structure of the periodic table is directly related toenergy levels and arrangements of electrons. The patterns that emergefrom this relationship enable you to predict the number of valence elec-trons for any main group element. They also enable you to predict thenumber of energy levels that an element ’s electrons occupy. The relation-
ship between electrons and the position of elements in the periodic tableleads to other patterns, as well. You will examine several of these patternsin the next section.
State the periodic law, and provide at least two examples to
illustrate its meaning.

In section 2.1, you learned that the size of a typical atom is about 10−10m.
You know, however, that the atoms of each element are distinctly differ-ent. For example, the atoms of different elements have different numbersof protons. This means, of course, that they also have different numbers of electrons. You might predict that the size of an atom is related to thenumber of protons and electrons it has. Is there evidence to support thisprediction? If so, is there a pattern that can help you predict the relativesize of an atom for any element in the periodic table?
In Investigation 2-A, you will look for a pattern involving the size of
atoms. Chemists de ﬁne, and measure, an atom ’s size in terms of its radius.
The radius of an atom is the distance from its nucleus to the approximate
outer boundary of the cloud-like region of its electrons. This boundary isapproximate because atoms are not solid spheres. They do not have aﬁxed outer boundary.
Figure 2.12 represents how the radius of an atom extends from its
nucleus to the approximate outer boundary of its electron cloud. Noticethat the radius line in this diagram is just inside the outer boundary of theelectron cloud. An electron may also spend time beyond the end of theradius line.

52 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingTrends for Atomic Size (Radius)
There are two general trends for atomic size:
•As you go down each group in the periodic table, the size of an atom
increases . This makes sense if you consider energy levels. As you go
down a group, the valence electrons occupy an energy level that is farther and farther from the nucleus. Thus, the valence electrons experi-ence less attraction for the nucleus. In addition, electrons in the innerenergy levels block, or shield , the valence electrons from the attraction
of the nucleus. As a result, the total volume of the atom, and thus thesize, increases with each additional energy level.
•As you go across a period, the size of an atom decreases . This trend
might surprise you at ﬁrst, since the number of electrons increases as
you go across a period. You might think that more electrons wouldoccupy more space, making the atom larger. You might also think thatrepulsion from their like charges would force the electrons farther apart.The size of an atom decreases, however, because the positive charge onthe nucleus also increases across a period. As well, without additionalenergy the electrons are restricted to their outer energy level. For exam-ple, the outer energy level for Period 2 elements is the second energylevel. Electrons cannot move beyond this energy level. As a result, thepositive force exerted by the nucleus pulls the outer electrons closer,reducing the atom ’s total size.
Figure 2.13 summarizes the trends for atomic size. The Practice
Problems that follow give you a chance to apply your understanding ofthese trends.

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 53Trends for Ionization Energy
A neutral atom contains equal numbers of positive charges (protons) and
negative charges (electrons). The particle that results when a neutral atomgains electrons or gives up electrons is called an ion. Thus, an ion is a
charged particle. An atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively
charged anion . An atom that gives up electrons becomes a positively
charged cation .Figure 2.14 shows the formation of ions for several ele-
ments. As you examine the diagrams, pay special attention to•the energy level from which electrons are gained or given up
•the charge on the ion that is formed when an atom gains or gives up
electrons
•the arrangement of the electrons that remain after electrons are gained
or given up
These diagrams show the ions that are formed from neutral atoms of
sodium, magnesium, sulfur, and chlorine. What other element has the same electronarrangement that sodium, magnesium, sul ﬁde, and chloride ions have?
Try to visualize the periodic table as a cylinder, rather than a ﬂat
plane. Can you see a relationship between ion formation and the electronarrangement of noble gases? Examine Figure 2.14 as well as 2.15 on thenext page. The metals that are main-group elements tend to give up elec-
trons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearestnoble gases. Non-metals tend to gain electrons and form ions that have
the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases. For example,when a sodium atom gives up its single valence electron, it becomes apositively charged sodium ion. Its outer electron arrangement is likeneon ’s outer electron arrangement. When a ﬂuorine atom gains an
electron, it becomes a negatively charged ion with an outer electronarrangement like that of neon.Figure 2.14ClClClClClClGroup 16 (VIA)

54 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingFigure 2.15 can help you determine the charge on an ion. Count the
number of groups an ion is from the nearest noble gas. That number is the charge on the ion. For example, aluminum is three groups away from neon. Thus, an aluminum ion has a charge of 3 +. Sulfur is two
groups away from argon. Thus, a sul ﬁde ion has a charge of 2 −.
Remember: Metals form positive ions (cations) and non-metals form
negative ions (anions).
It takes energy to overcome the attractive force of a nucleus and pull
an electron away from a neutral atom. The energy that is required toremove an electron from an atom is called ionization energy . The bar
graph in Figure 2.16 shows the ionization energy that is needed to removeone electron from the outer energy level of the atoms of the main-group elements. This energy is called the ﬁrst ionization energy. It is measured
in units of kJ/mol. A kilojoule (kJ) is a unit of energy. A mole (mol) is anamount of a substance. (You will learn about the mole in Unit 2.)
As you can see, atoms that give up electrons easily have low ioniza-
tion energies. You would probably predict that the alkali metals of Group1 (IA) would have low ionization energies. These elements are, in fact,extremely reactive because it takes so little energy to remove their singlevalence electron.
This graph represents the ﬁrst ionization energy for the main-group
elements.Figure 2.1605001000150020002500

All elements, except hydrogen,
have more than one electronthat can be removed.Therefore, they have morethan one ionization energy. The energy that is needed toremove a second electron iscalled the second ionization
energy. The energy that is
needed to remove a third electron is the third ionization
energy , and so on. What trend

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 55Summarizing Trends for Ionization Energy
Although you can see a few exceptions in Figure 2.16, there are two
general trends for ionization energy:•Ionization energy tends to decrease down a group . This makes sense in
terms of the energy level that the valence electrons occupy. Electrons inthe outer energy level are farther from the positive force of the nucleus.Thus, they are easier to remove than electrons in lower energy levels.
•Ionization energy tends to increase across a period . As you go across a
period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outerenergy level increases. Thus, more energy is needed to pull an electronaway from its atom. For this trend to be true, you would expect a noblegas to have the highest ionization energy of all the elements in the sameperiod. As you can see in Figure 2.16, they do.
Figure 2.17 summarizes these general trends for ionization energy.
The Practice Problems below give you a chance to apply your understand-ing of these trends.

Manitoba Mine Specializes in Rare Metals
At TANCO in Bernic Lake, Manitoba, miners
are busy ﬁnding and processing two rare and
very different metallic elements: tantalum andcesium. Both of these metals are importantparts of “high-tech ” applications around the
world. They are used in nuclear reactors and asparts of aircraft, missiles, camera lenses, andsurgical instruments like the one shown above.
Tantalum is found only in Canada,
Australia, Brazil, Zaire, and China. TANCO(the Tantalum Mining Corporation of Canada)is the only mine in North America that pro-duces tantalum. TANCO is also the world ’s
main producer of cesium. Other than the factthat tantalum and cesium are both found atTANCO and both are used in high-tech applications, they share little in common.
Tantalum is a heavy, hard, and brittle grey
metal. In its pure form, it is extremely ductileand can be made into a ﬁne wire. This has
proved useful for making surgical sutures.Another property that makes tantalum useful isits resistance to corrosion by most acids, due toits very limited reactivity. At normal tempera-tures, tantalum is virtually non-reactive. Infact, tantalum has about the same resistance tocorrosion as glass. Tantalum can withstandhigher temperatures than glass, however. It hasa melting point of 3290 K —higher than the
melting points of all other elements, excepttungsten and rhenium. Tantalum ’s resistance
to corrosion and high melting point make itsuitable for use in surgical equipment andimplants. For example, some of the pins thatare used by surgeons to hold a patient ’s broken
bones together are made of tantalum.
Tantalum is resistant to corrosion because a
thin ﬁlm of tantalum oxide forms when tanta-
lum is exposed to oxygen. The metal oxide actsas a protective layer. The oxide also has specialrefractive properties that make it ideal for usein camera lenses.
Cesium is quite different from tantalum,
but it, too, has many high-tech applications.Cesium is a silvery-white metal. It is found in a mineral called pollucite. Cesium is the softestof all the metals and is a liquid at just aboveroom temperature. It is also the most reactivemetal on Earth.
Cesium has a low ionization energy. It
readily gives up its single valence electron to form crystalline compounds with all the halogen non-metals. Cesium is also very photoelectric. This means that it easily givesup its lone outer electron when it is exposed to light. Thus, cesium is used in televisioncameras and traf ﬁc signals. As well, it has the
potential to be used in ion propulsion enginesfor travel into deep space.
Making Connections
1.Make a table to show the differences andsimilarities between tantalum and cesium.For each metal, add a column to describehow its different properties make it usefulfor speci ﬁc applications.
2.Bernic Lake is one of the few locations
where tantulum can be found. As well, it is the most important cesium source inthe world. Research and describe what geographical conditions led to the presenceof two such rare metals in one location.

Chapter 2  Elements and the Periodic Table • MHR 57Trends for Electron Af ﬁnity
In everyday conversation, if you like something, you may say that you
have an af ﬁnity for it. For example, what if you enjoy pizza and detest
asparagus? You may say that you have a high af ﬁnity for pizza and a
low af ﬁnity for asparagus. If you prefer asparagus to pizza, your af ﬁnities
are reversed.
Atoms are not living things, so they do not like or dislike anything.
You know, however, that some atoms have a low attraction for electrons.Other atoms have a greater attraction for electrons. Electron afﬁnity is a
measure of the change in energy that occurs when an electron is added to the outer energy level of an atom to form a negative ion.
Figure 2.18 identi ﬁes the electron af ﬁnities of the main-group
elements. If energy is released when an atom of an element gains an electron, the electron af ﬁnity is expressed as a negative integer. When
energy is absorbed when an electron is added, electron af ﬁnity is low, and
is expressed as a positive integer. Notice, for example, that ﬂuorine has
the highest electron af ﬁnity (indicated by a large, negative integer). This
indicates that ﬂuorine is very likely to be involved in chemical reactions.
In fact, ﬂuorine is the most reactive of all the elements.
Metals have very low electron af ﬁnities. This is especially true for the
Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements. Atoms of these elements form stablepositive ions. A negative ion that is formed by the elements of thesegroups is unstable. It breaks apart into a neutral atom and a free electron.
Examine Figure 2.18. What trends can you observe? How regular are
these trends?
The units for electron af ﬁnity are the same as
the units for ionization energy: kJ/mol. High negative numbers mean a high electron af ﬁnity. Low negative numbers and any
positive numbers mean a low electron af ﬁnity. Figure 2.181

Analyzing the Ice Man ’s Axe
In September 1991, hikers in the Alps Mountains
near the Austrian-Italian border discovered thebody of a man who had been trapped in a glacier.He was almost perfectly preserved. With him wasan assortment of tools, including an axe with ametal blade.
Scientists were particularly interested in the
axe. At ﬁrst, they believed that it was bronze,
which is an alloy of copper and tin. There was acomplication, however. Dating techniques that
were used for the clothing and body suggestedthat the “Ice Man ” was about 5300 years old.
Bronze implements do not appear in Europe ’s fos-
sil record until about 4000 years ago. EitherEuropeans were using bronze earlier than origi-nally thought, or the axe was made of a differentmaterial. Copper was consistent with the IceMan ’s age, since it has been used for at least the
past 6000 years.
One technique to determine a metal ’s identity
is to dissolve it in acid. The resulting solution isexamined for evidence of ions. Scientists did notwant to damage the precious artifact in any way,though.
The solution was an analytical technique
called X-ray ﬂuorescence . The object is irradiated
with high-energy X-ray radiation. Its atomsabsorb the radiation, causing electrons from alower energy level to be ejected from the atom.This causes electrons from an outer energy levelto “move in, ” to occupy the vacated space. As
the electrons fall to a less energetic state, theyemit X-rays. The electrons of each atom emit X-rays of a particular wavelength. Scientists usethis energy “signature ” to identify the atom.
Analysis by X-ray ﬂuorescence revealed
that the metal in the blade of the axe was almostpure copper.

Despite some irregularities and exceptions, the following periodic trends
summarize the relationships among atomic size, ionization energy, andelectron af ﬁnity:
•Trends for atomic size are the reverse of trends for ionization energy
and electron af ﬁnity. Larger atoms tend to have lower ionization
energies and lower electron af ﬁnities.
•Group 16 (VIA) and 17 (VIIA) elements attract electrons strongly. They
do not give up electrons readily. In other words, they have a strong tendency to form negative ions. Thus, they have high ionization energies and high electron af ﬁnities.
•Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements give up electrons readily. They have
low or no attraction for electrons. In other words, they have a strongtendency to form positive ions. Thus, they have low ionization energiesand low electron af ﬁnities.
•Group 18 (VIIIA) elements do not attract electrons and do not give up
electrons. In other words, they do not naturally form ions. (They arevery stable.) Thus, they have very high ionization energies and very low electron af ﬁnities.

The year was 1896. A chance discovery sent a message echoing from
Yukon’s Far North to the southern reaches of the United States: “Gold!”People migrated in great numbers to the Yukon Territory, hoping to maketheir fortunes. Within two years, these migrants transformed a small ﬁsh-ing village into bustling Dawson City— one of Canada’s largest cities atthe time. They also launched the country’s ﬁrst metal-mining industry.
Gold, like all metals, is shiny, malleable, ductile, and a good conduc-
tor of electricity and heat. Unlike most metals and other elements, howev-er, gold is found in nature in its pure form, as an element. Most elementsare chemically combined in the form of compounds. Why is this so? Whydo atoms of some elements join together as compounds, while others donot? In this chapter, you will use the periodic trends you examined inChapter 2 to help you answer these questions. You will learn about thebonds that hold elements together in compounds. At the same time, youwill learn how to write chemical formulas and how to name compounds.

Specific Expectations  As you learned in the chapter opener, most elements do not exist in
nature in their pure form, as elements. Gold, silver, and platinum arethree metals that can be found in Earth’s crust as elements. They arecalled “precious metals” because this occurrence is so rare. Most othermetals, and most other elements, are found in nature only as compounds.
As the prospectors in the Yukon gold rush were searching for the
element gold, they were surrounded by compounds. The streams theypanned for gold ran with water, H
2O, a compound that is essential to the
survival of nearly every organism on this planet. To sustain their energy,the prospectors ate food that contained, among other things, starch. Starch is a complex compound that consists of carbon, hydrogen, andoxygen. To ﬂavour their food, they added sodium chloride, NaCl, which is commonly called table salt. Sometimes a compound called pyrite, alsoknown as “fool’s gold,” tricked a prospector. Pyrite (iron disulﬁde, FeS
2)
looks almost exactly like gold, as you can see in Figure 3.1. Pyrite, however, will corrode, and it is not composed of rare elements. Thus, itwas not valuable to a prospector.Classifying Chemical Compounds
Prospectors used the physical properties of gold and pyrite to distinguish
between them. Can you tell which of these photos shows gold and which shows pyrite?Figure 3.1
There are only about 90 naturally occurring elements. In comparison,
there are thousands upon thousands of different compounds in nature,and more are constantly being discovered. Elements combine in many different ways to form the astonishing variety of natural and syntheticcompounds that you see and use every day.A B

You take the results home to organize and ana-
lyze them. Unfortunately your colleague labelledthe tests by sample number and forgot to writedown which compound corresponded to eachsample number. You realize, however, that youcan use the properties of the compounds to identify them. Then you can use the compounds ’

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 69Table Salt: An Ionic Compound
Sodium chloride, NaCl, is a familiar compound. You know it as table salt.
The sodium in sodium chloride plays a vital role in body functions. Weneed to ingest about 500 mg of sodium a day. Too much sodium chloride,however, may contribute to high blood pressure. In the winter, sodiumchloride is put on roads and sidewalks to melt the ice, as shown in Figure 3.2. Although this use of sodium chloride increases the safety ofpedestrians and drivers, there are several drawbacks. For example, thesaltwater discolours and damages footwear, and it corrodes the metal bodies of cars and trucks. Also, as shown in Figure 3.3, deer and moosethat are attracted to the salt on the roads can be struck by vehicles.
This moose was attracted to the sodium chloride that was put on the road
to melt snow and ice. Humans, like most organisms, need sodium to maintain normalbody functions.
Sodium chloride is a typical ionic compound. Like most ionic com-
pounds, it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It melts at a veryhigh temperature, at 801 ˚C. As well, it dissolves easily in water. A solu-
tion of sodium chloride in water is a good conductor of electricity. Liquidsodium chloride is also a good electrical conductor.
Carbon Dioxide: A Covalent Compound
The cells of most organisms produce carbon dioxide, CO2,
during cellular respiration: the process that releases energyfrom food. Plants, like the ones shown in Figure 3.4, synthe-size their own food from carbon dioxide and water using the Sun ’s energy.
Carbon dioxide has most of the properties of a typical
covalent compound. It has a low melting point ( –79˚C). At
certain pressures and temperatures, carbon dioxide is a liq-uid. Liquid carbon dioxide is a weak conductor of electricity. Figure 3.3
Plants use carbon dioxide and water to produce their own
food, using the Sun ’s energy.Figure 3.4
Sodium chloride is
used to melt ice because saltwater has a lower melting pointthan pure water.Figure 3.2
70 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingCarbon dioxide is somewhat soluble in water, especially at high pressures.
This is why soft drinks are bottled under pressure. When you open a bottle of pop, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution. Often,this happens too quickly, as you can see in Figure 3.5. A solution of carbon dioxide in water is a weak conductor of electricity.
What Is Bonding?
Why are carbon dioxide and sodium chloride so different? Why can wedivide compounds into two categories that display distinct physical properties? The answers come from an understanding of chemical bonds :
the forces that attract atoms to each other in compounds. Bonding
involves the interaction between the valence electrons of atoms . Usually
the formation of a bond between two atoms creates a compound that ismore stable than either of the two atoms on their own.
The different properties of ionic and covalent compounds result from
the manner in which chemical bonds form between atoms in these com-pounds. Atoms can either exchange or share electrons.
When two atoms exchange electrons, one atom loses its valence
electron(s) and the other atom gains the electron(s) . This kind of bonding
usually occurs between a metal and a non-metal. Recall, from Chapter 2,that metals have low ionization energies and non-metals have high elec-tron af ﬁnities. That is, metals tend to lose electrons and non-metals tend
to gain them. When atoms exchange electrons, they form an ionic bond .
Atoms can also share electrons. This kind of bond forms between two
non-metals. It can also form between a metal and a non-metal when themetal has a fairly high ionization energy. When atoms share electrons,
they form a covalent bond .
How can you determine whether the bonds that hold a compound
together are ionic or covalent? Examining the physical properties of the compound is one method. This method is not always satisfactory,however. Often a compound has some ionic characteristics and somecovalent characteristics. You saw this in the previous Thought Lab.
For example, hydrogen chloride, also known as hydrochloric acid, has
a low melting point and a low boiling point. (It is a gas at room tempera-ture.) These properties might lead you to believe that hydrogen chloride isa covalent compound. Hydrogen chloride, however, is extremely solublein water, and the water solution conducts electricity. These properties arecharacteristic of an ionic compound. Is there a clear, theoretical way todecide whether the bond between hydrogen and chlorine is ionic or covalent? The answer lies in a periodic trend.
Electronegativity: Attracting Electrons
When two atoms form a bond, each atom attracts the other atom’s electrons in addition to its own. The electronegativity of an atom is a
measure of an atom ’s ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. EN
is used to symbolize electronegativity. There is a speci ﬁc electronegativity
associated with each element.
As you can see in Figure 3.6, electronegativity is a periodic property,
just as atomic size, ionization energy, and electron af ﬁnity are. Atomic
size, ionization energy, and electron af ﬁnity, however, are properties of
single atoms. In contrast, electronegativity is a property of atoms that areinvolved in chemical bonding.Do you think that water is a
covalent compound or an ionic compound? List water’sphysical properties. Can you tell whether water is acovalent compound or an ionic compound based only on its physical properties?Why or why not?
The bubbles ﬁzzing
out of the soft drink contain car-bon dioxide.Figure 3.5
Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 71The trend for electronegativity is the reverse of the trend for atomic size.
Examine Figure 3.7, on the next page, to see what this means. In general,as atomic size decreases from left to right across a period, electronegativi-ty increases. Why? The number of protons (which attract electrons) in thenucleus increases. At the same time, the number of ﬁlled, inner electron
energy levels (which shield the protons from valence electrons) remainsthe same. Thus the electrons are pulled more tightly to the nucleus,resulting in a smaller atomic size. The atom attracts a bonding pair ofelectrons more strongly, because the bonding pair can move closer tothe nucleus.
In the second period, for example, lithium has the largest atomic
size and the lowest electronegativity. As atomic size decreases across thesecond period, the electronegativity increases. Fluorine has the smallestatomic size in the third period (except for neon) and the highest elec-tronegativity. Because noble gases do not usually participate in bonding,their electronegativities are not given.
Similarly, as atomic size increases down a group, electronegativity
decreases. As you move down a group, valence electrons are less stronglyattracted to the nucleus because the number of ﬁlled electron energy
levels between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. In a compound, increasing energy levels between valence electrons and thenucleus mean that the nucleus attracts bonding pairs less strongly.
For example, in Group 2 (IIA), beryllium has the smallest atomic
radius and the largest electronegativity. As atomic size increases down the group, electronegativity decreases.
Figure 3.7 shows the relationship between atomic size and electro-
negativity for the main-group elements in periods 2 to 6.1

72 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingPredicting Bond Type Using Electronegativity
You can use the differences between electronegativities to decide whether
the bond between two atoms is ionic or covalent. The symbol ∆ENstands
for the difference between two electronegativity values. When calculatingthe electronegativity difference, the smaller electronegativity is alwayssubtracted from the larger electronegativity, so that the electronegativitydifference is always positive.
How can the electronegativity difference help you predict the type of
bond? By the end of this section, you will understand the aswer to thisquestion. Consider three different substances: potassium ﬂuoride, KF,
oxygen, O
2, and hydrochloric acid, HCl. Potassium ﬂuoride is an ionic
compound made up of a metal and a non-metal that have very differentelectronegativities. Potassium ’s electronegativity is 0.82. Fluorine ’s
electronegativity is 3.98. Therefore, ∆ENfor the bond between potassium
and ﬂuorine is 3.16.
Now consider oxygen. This element exists as units of two atoms held
together by covalent bonds. Each oxygen atom has an electronegativity of3.44. The bond that holds the oxygen atoms together has an electronega-tivity difference of 0.00 because each atom in an oxygen molecule has anequal attraction for the bonding pair of electrons.
Finally, consider hydrogen chloride, or hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen
has an electronegativity of 2.20, and chlorine has an electronegativity of3.16. Therefore, the electronegativity difference for the chemical bond inhydrochloric acid, HCl, is 0.96. Hydrogen chloride is a gas at room tem-perature, but its water solution conducts electricity. Is hydrogen chloridea covalent compound or an ionic compound? Its ∆ENcan help you
decide, as you will see below.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 73The Range of Electronegativity Differences
When two atoms have electronegativities that are identical, as in oxygen,
they share their bonding pair of electrons equally between them in a covalent bond. When two atoms have electronegativities that are very dif-ferent, as in potassium ﬂuoride, the atom with the lower electronegativity
loses an electron to the atom with the higher electronegativity. In potassium ﬂuoride, potassium gives up its valence electron to ﬂuorine.
Therefore, the bond is ionic.
It is not always clear whether atoms share electrons or transfer them.
Atoms with different electronegativities can share electrons unequallywithout exchanging them. How unequal does the sharing have to bebefore the bond is considered ionic?
Figure 3.8 shows the range of electronegativity differences. These
values go from mostly covalent at 0.0 to mostly ionic at 3.3. Chemists consider bonds with an electronegativity difference that is greater than 1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity difference that is lessthan 1.7 to be covalent.
Chemical bonds range in character from mostly ionic to mostly covalent.
Table 3.2 shows how you can think of bonds as having a percent ioniccharacter or percent covalent character, based on their electronegativitydifferences. When bonds have nearly 50% ionic or covalent character,they have characteristics of both types of bonding.
Table 3.2 Character of Bonds
Based on Table 3.2, what kind of bond forms between hydrogen and
chlorine? ∆ENfor the bond in hydrogen chloride, HCl, is 0.96. This is
lower than 1.7. Therefore, the bond in hydrogen chloride is a covalentbond.

Specific Expectations  3.2
Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 75In section 3.1, you reviewed your understanding of the physical proper-
ties of covalent and ionic compounds. You learned how to distinguishbetween an ionic bond and a covalent bond based on the differencebetween the electronegativities of the atoms. By considering what happens to electrons when atoms form bonds, you will be able to explainsome of the characteristic properties of ionic and covalent compounds.
The Octet Rule
Why do atoms form bonds? When atoms are bonded together, they areoften more stable. We know that noble gases are the most stable elementsin the periodic table. What evidence do we have? The noble gases areextremely unreactive. They do not tend to form compounds. What do thenoble gases have in common? They have a ﬁlled outer electron energy
level. When an atom loses, gains, or shares electrons through bonding to achieve a ﬁlled outer electron energy level, the resulting compound
is often very stable.
According to the octet rule , atoms bond in order to achieve an
electron con ﬁguration that is the same as the electron con ﬁguration of a
noble gas. When two atoms or ions have the same electron con ﬁguration,
they are said to be isoelectronic with one another. For example, Cl
−is
isoelectronic with Ar because both have 18 electrons and a ﬁlled outer
energy level. This rule is called the octet rule because all the noble gases(except helium) have eight electrons in their ﬁlled outer energy level.
(Recall that helium ’s outer electron energy level contains only two
electrons.)
Ionic Bonding
In Section 3.1 you learned that the electronegativity difference for the bond between sodium and chlorine is 2.1. Thus, the bond is an ionic bond. Sodium has avery low electronegativity, and chlorine has a very high electronegativity. Therefore, when sodium andchlorine interact, sodium transfers its valence electronto chlorine. As shown in Figure 3.9, sodium becomes
Na
+and chlorine becomes Cl−.
How does the formation of an ionic bond between
sodium and chlorine re ﬂect the octet rule? Neutral
sodium has one valence electron. When it loses this electron to chlorine, the resulting Na
+cation has an
electron energy level that contains eight electrons. It is isoelectronic with the noble gas neon. On the otherhand, chlorine has an outer electron energy level thatcontains seven electrons. When chlorine gains sodium ’sIonic and Covalent

Sodium ’s electron is transferred to chlorine. The atoms
become oppositely charged ions with stable octets. Because theyare oppositely charged, they are strongly attracted to one another.Figure 3.9
76 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical Bondingelectron, it becomes an anion that is isoelectronic with the noble gas
argon. As you can see in Figure 3.10, you can represent the formation ofan ionic bond using Lewis structures.
Thus, in an ionic bond, electrons are transferred from one atom to
another so that they form oppositely charged ions. The strong force ofattraction between the oppositely charged ions is what holds them together.
These Lewis structures show the formation of a bond between a sodium
atom and a chlorine atom.
Transferring Multiple Electrons
In sodium chloride, NaCl, one electron is transferred from sodium to
chlorine. In order to satisfy the octet rule, two or three electrons may be transferred from one atom to another. For example, consider what happens when magnesium and oxygen combine.
The electronegativity difference for magnesium oxide is
3.4−1.3=2.1. Therefore, magnesium oxide is an ionic compound.
Magnesium contains two electrons in its outer shell. Oxygen contains six electrons in its outer shell. In order to become isoelectronic with anoble gas, magnesium needs to lose two electrons and oxygen needs togain two electrons. Hence, magnesium transfers its two valence electronsto oxygen, as shown in Figure 3.11. Magnesium becomes Mg
2+, and
oxygen becomes O2−.
These Lewis structures show the formation of a bond between a magne-
sium atom and an oxygen atom.

Metallurgist
Alison Dickson
Alison Dickson is a metallurgist at Polaris, the
world ’s northernmost mine. Polaris is located on
Little Cornwallis Island in Nunavut. It is a leadand zinc mine, operated by Cominco Ltd., theworld ’s largest producer of zinc concentrate.
After ore is mined at Polaris, metallurgists
must separate the valuable lead- and zinc-bearingcompounds from the waste or “slag. ” First the
ore is crushed and ground with water to produceﬂour-like particles. Next a process called ﬂotation
is used to separate the minerals from the slag. In ﬂotation, chemicals are added to the metal-
containing compounds. The chemicals react withthe lead and zinc to make them very insoluble inwater, or hydrophobic . Air is then bubbled
through the mineral and water mixture. Thehydrophobic particles attach to the bubbles andﬂoat to the surface. They form a stable froth, or
concentrate, which is collected. The concentrateis ﬁltered and dried, and then stored for
shipment.
Dickson says that she decided on metallurgy
as a career because she wanted to do somethingthat was “hands-on. ” After completing her sec-
ondary education in Malaysia, where she grew up, Dickson moved to Canada. She studiedmining and mineral process engineering at theUniversity of British Columbia.
Dickson says that she also wanted to do
something adventurous. She wanted to travel andlive in different cultures. As a summer student,Dickson worked at a Chilean copper mine. Hercurrent job with Cominco involves frequent travelto various mines. “Every day provides a new
challenge, ” Dickson says. When she is at Polaris,
Dickson enjoys polar bear sightings on the tundra.

Ionic Bonding That Involves More Than Two Ions
Sometimes ionic compounds contain more than one atom of each ele-
ment. For example, consider the compound that is formed from calciumand ﬂuorine. Because the electronegativity difference between calcium
and ﬂuorine is 3.0, you know that a bond between calcium and ﬂuorine
is ionic. Calcium has two electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs to lose two electrons according to the octet rule. Fluorine has seven elec-trons in its outer energy level, so it needs to gain one electron, againaccording to the octet rule. How do the electrons of these elements interact so that each element achieves a ﬁlled outer energy level?
These Lewis structures show the formation of bonds between one atom of
calcium and two atoms of ﬂuorine.
Examine Figure 3.11. In an ionic bond, calcium tends to lose two
electrons and ﬂuorine tends to gain one electron. Therefore, one calcium
atom bonds with two ﬂuorine atoms. Calcium loses one of each of its
valence electrons to each ﬂuorine atom. Calcium becomes Ca2+, and
ﬂuorine becomes F−. They form the compound calcium ﬂuoride, CaF 2.
In the following Practice Problems, you will predict the kind of ionic
compound that will form from two elements.Figure 3.12CaF

Now that you understand the nature of the bonds in ionic compounds,
can you explain some of their properties? Consider electrical conductivity.Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in their solid state. They arevery good conductors in their liquid state, however, or when they are dis-solved in water. To explain these properties, ask yourself two questions:
1.What is required for electrical conductivity?
2.What is the structure of ionic compounds in the liquid, solid, and dissolved states?
An electrical current can ﬂow only if charged particles are available to
move and carry the current. Consider sodium chloride as an example. Isthere a mobile charge in solid sodium chloride? No, there is not. In thesolid state, sodium and chlorine ions are bonded to each other by strongionic bonds. Like all solid-state ionic compounds, the ions are arranged in a rigid lattice formation, as shown in Figure 3.13.4.For each pair of elements, determine ∆EN.

other properties of ionic com-pounds can you now explainwith your new understandingof ionic bonding?In the solid state, the ions cannot move very much. Thus, there is no
mobile charge. Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.
In molten sodium chloride, the rigid lattice structure is broken. The ions
that make up the compound are free to move, and they easily conductelectricity. Similarly, when sodium chloride is dissolved, the sodium and chlorine ions are free to move. The solution is a good conductor of electricity, as shown in Figure 3.14. You will learn more about ioniccompounds in solution in Chapter 9.
You are probably familiar with the ionic crystals in caves. Stalagmites and
stalactites are crystal columns that form when water, containing dissolvedlime, drips very slowly from the ceiling of a cave onto the ﬂoor below.
How do these ionic crystals grow?
When a clear solution of an ionic compound is poured over a seed

HHCovalent Bonding
You have learned what happens when the electronegativity difference
between two atoms is greater than 1.7. The atom with the lower elec-tronegativity transfers its valence electron(s) to the atom with the higherelectronegativity. The resulting ions have opposite charges. They are heldtogether by a strong ionic bond.
What happens when the electronegativity difference is very small?
What happens when the electronegativity difference is zero? As an exam-ple, consider chlorine. Chlorine is a yellowish, noxious gas. What is it likeat the atomic level? Each chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outerenergy level. In order for chlorine to achieve the electron con ﬁguration of
a noble gas according to the octet rule, it needs to gain one electron. Whentwo chlorine atoms bond together, their electronegativity difference iszero. The electrons are equally attracted to each atom.
Therefore, instead of transferring electrons, the two atoms each share
one electron with each other. In other words, each atom contributes oneelectron to a covalent bond. A covalent bond consists of a pair of shared
electrons . Thus, each chlorine atom achieves a ﬁlled outer electron energy
level, satisfying the octet rule. Examine Figure 3.15 to see how to repre-sent a covalent bond with a Lewis structure.
When two atoms of the same element form a bond, they share their
electrons equally in a pure covalent bond . Elements with atoms that bond
to each other in this way are known as diatomic elements .
When atoms such as carbon and hydrogen bond to each other, their
electronegativities are so close that they share their electrons almostequally. Carbon and hydrogen have an electronegativity difference of only
2.6−2.2=0.4. In Figure 3.16, you can see how one atom of carbon forms
a covalent bond with four atoms of hydrogen. The compound methane,
CH
4, is formed.
Each hydrogen atom shares one of its electrons with the carbon. The
carbon shares one of its four valence electrons with each hydrogen. Thus,each hydrogen atom achieves a ﬁlled outer energy level, and so does
carbon. (Recall that elements in the ﬁrst period need only two electrons
to ﬁll their outer energy level.) When analyzing Lewis structures that show
covalent bonds, count the shared electrons as if they belong to each of thebonding atoms . In the following Practice Problems, you will represent
covalent bonding using Lewis structures.These Lewis

N NMultiple Covalent Bonds
Atoms sometimes transfer more than one electron in ionic bonding.
Similarly, in covalent bonding, atoms sometimes need to share two orthree pairs of electrons, according to the octet rule. For example, considerthe familiar diatomic element oxygen. Each oxygen atom has six electronsin its outer energy level. Therefore, each atom requires two additionalelectrons to achieve a stable octet. When two oxygen atoms form a bond,they share two pairs of electrons, as shown in Figure 3.17. This kind ofcovalent bond is called a double bond .
Double bonds can form between different elements, as well. For
example, consider what happens when carbon bonds to oxygen in carbondioxide. To achieve a stable octet, carbon requires four electrons, and oxygen requires two electrons. Hence, two atoms of oxygen bond to oneatom of carbon. Each oxygen forms a double bond with the carbon, asshown in Figure 3.18.
When atoms share three pairs of electrons, they form a triple bond .
Diatomic nitrogen contains a triple bond, as you can see in Figure 3.19.Try the following problems to practise representing covalent bondingusing Lewis structures. Watch for multiple bonding!

Explaining the Low Conductivity of Covalent Compounds
Covalent compounds have a wider variety of properties than ionic
compounds. Some dissolve in water, and some do not. Some conductelectricity when molten or dissolved in water, and some do not. If youconsider only covalent compounds that contain bonds with an electroneg-ativity difference that is less than 0.5, you will notice greater consistency.For example, consider the compounds carbon disul ﬁde, CS
2, dichlorine
monoxide, Cl2O, and carbon tetrachloride, C Cl4. What are some of the
properties of these compounds? They all have low boiling points. None ofthem conducts electricity in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state.
How do we explain the low conductivity of these pure covalent
compounds? The atoms in each compound are held together by strongcovalent bonds. Whether the compound is in the liquid, solid, or gaseousstate, these bonds do not break. Thus, covalent compounds (unlike ioniccompounds) do not break up into ions when they melt or boil. Instead,their atoms remain bonded together as molecules. For this reason, cova-lent compounds are also called molecular compounds . The molecules
that make up a pure covalent compound cannot carry a current, even ifthe compound is in its liquid state or in solution.These Lewis
structures show the formation of a double bond between twoatoms of oxygen.Figure 3.17

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 83Evidence for Intermolecular Forces
You have learned that pure covalent compounds are not
held together by ionic bonds in lattice structures. They doform liquids and solids at low temperatures, however.Something must hold the molecules together when a covalent compound is in its liquid or solid state. The forcesthat bond the atoms to each other within a molecule are
called intramolecular forces . Covalent bonds are intramole-
cular forces. In comparison, the forces that bond molecules
to each other are called intermolecular forces .
You can see the difference between intermolecular
forces and intramolecular forces in Figure 3.20. Becausepure covalent compounds have low melting and boilingpoints, you know that the intermolecular forces must bevery weak compared with the intramolecular forces. It doesnot take very much energy to break the bonds that hold themolecules to each other.
There are several different types of intermolecular
forces. You will learn more about them in section 3.3, aswell as in Chapters 8 and 11.
Metallic Bonding
In this chapter, you have seen that non-metals tend to form ionic bonds with metals. Non-metals tend to form covalent bonds with othernon-metals and with themselves. How do metals bond to each other?
We know that elements that tend to form ionic bonds have very
different electronegativities. Metals bonding to themselves or to other metals do not have electronegativity differences that are greater than 1.7.Therefore, metals probably do not form ionic bonds with each other.
Evidence bears this out. A pure metal, such as sodium, is soft enough
to be cut with a butter knife. Other pure metals, such as copper or gold,can be drawn into wires or hammered into sheets. Ionic compounds, by contrast, are hard and brittle.
Do metals form covalent bonds with each other? No.
They do not have enough valence electrons to achieve stable octets by sharing electrons. Although metals do notform covalent bonds, however, they do share their electrons.
In metallic bonding, atoms release their electrons to a
shared pool of electrons. You can think of a metal as a non-rigid arrangement of metal ions in a sea of free electrons, as shown in Figure 3.21. The force that holds metal atomstogether is called a metallic bond . Unlike ionic or covalent
bonding, metallic bonding does not have a particular orien-tation in space. Because the electrons are free to move, themetal ions are not rigidly held in a lattice formation.Therefore, when a hammer pounds metal, the atoms canslide past one another. This explains why metals can be easily hammered into sheets.
Pure metals contain metallic bonds, as do alloys. An alloy is a
homogeneous mixture of two or more metals. Different alloys can havedifferent amounts of elements. Each alloy, however, has a uniform compo-sition throughout. One example of an alloy is bronze. Bronze containscopper, tin, and lead, joined together with metallic bonds. You will learnmore about alloys in Chapter 4 and Chapter 8.

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 85In section 3.2, you learned what kind of bond forms when the electronega-
tivity difference between two atoms is very small or very large. You nowunderstand how electrons are shared or transferred in bonds. Thus, youcan explain the properties of ionic compounds, and some of the proper-ties of covalent compounds.
How can you explain the wide variety of properties that covalent
compounds have? Covalent compounds may be solids, liquids, or gases at different temperatures. Some covalent compounds dissolve in water,and some do not. In fact, water itself is a covalent compound! ExamineFigures 3.22 and 3.23. Why are the bonds in water different from thebonds in dinitrogen monoxide? Both of these compounds are made up oftwo elements, and each molecule contains three atoms.

86 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingPolar Covalent Bonds: The “In-Between ” Bonds
When two bonding atoms have an electronegativity difference that is
greater than 0.5 but less than 1.7, they are considered to be a particulartype of covalent bond called a polar covalent bond . In a polar covalent
bond, the atoms have signi ﬁcantly different electronegativities. The
electronegativity difference is not great enough, however, for the less electronegative atom to transfer its valence electrons to the other, moreelectronegative atom. The difference isgreat enough for the bonding
electron pair to spend more time near the more electronegative atom thanthe less electronegative atom.
For example, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water has
an electronegativity difference of 1.24. Because this value falls between0.5 and 1.7, the bond is a polar covalent bond. The oxygen attracts theelectrons more strongly than the hydrogen. Therefore, the oxygen has a slightly negative charge and the hydrogen has a slightly positive charge.Since the hydrogen does not completely transfer its electron to the oxy-gen, their respective charges are not +1 and −1, but rather δ
+and δ−. The
symbol δ+(delta plus) stands for a partial positive charge. The symbol
δ−(delta minus) stands for a partial negative charge. Figure 3.24 illustrates
the partial negative and positive charges across an oxygen-hydrogen bond.Figure 3.25 shows the polar covalent bond between hydrogen and chlorine.

88 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingTo understand why molecules have different shapes, consider how
electron arrangement affects shape. The Lewis structure for water, forexample, shows that the oxygen is surrounded by four electron pairs. Asshown in ﬁgure 3.26, two of the pairs are involved in bonding with the
hydrogen atoms and two of the pairs are not. Electron pairs that are notinvolved in bonding are called lone pairs . Electron pairs that are involved
in bonding are called bonding pairs .
Electron pairs are arranged around molecules so that they are a maxi-
mum distance from each other. This makes sense, because electrons arenegatively charged and they repel each other. The shape that allows fourelectron pairs to be a maximum distance from each other around an atomis a tetrahedron. Figure 3.27 shows a tetrahedron.
The Shape of a Water Molecule
In a water molecule, there are four electron pairs around the oxygen atom.Two of these pairs bond with the hydrogen. The electron pairs arearranged in a shape that is nearly tetrahedral. When you draw the molecule, however, you draw only the oxygen atom and the two hydrogenatoms. This is where the bent shape comes from, as you can see in Figure 3.28.
The Shape of a Carbon Dioxide Molecule
Now consider carbon dioxide, CO2. Why does a carbon dioxide molecule
have a linear shape? Examine the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide. Thecentral carbon atom is surrounded by eight electrons (four pairs), like theoxygen atom in a water molecule. In a carbon dioxide molecule, though,all the electrons are involved in bonding. There are no lone pairs. Becausethe bonding electrons spend most of their time between the carbon andoxygen atoms, they are arranged in a straight line. This allows them to beas far away from each other as possible, as you can see in Figure 3.29.
Carbon dioxide is linear in shape. Figure 3.29

Canadians in Chemistry
Dr. Geoffrey Ozin
His work has ﬂown on a Space Shuttle, and it has
been hailed as art. It may well be part of the nextcomputing revolution.
What does Dr. Geoffrey Ozin do? As little as
possible, for he believes in letting the atoms domost of the work. This approach has made himone of the more celebrated chemists in Canada.Time and again, he has brought together organicand inorganic molecules, polymers, and metals inorder to create materials with just the right struc-ture for a speci ﬁc purpose.
Self-assembly is the key. Atoms and
molecules are driven into pre-designed shapes by intermolecular forces and geometrical constraints. At the University of Toronto, Dr. Ozin
teaches his students the new science of inten-tional design, instead of the old trial-and-errormethods.
Born in London, England, in 1943, Geoffrey
Ozin earned a doctorate in chemistry at OxfordUniversity. He joined the University of Toronto in 1969. Ozin ’s father was a tailor. In a way, Ozin
is continuing the family tradition. Ozin, however,uses ionic and covalent bonds, atoms and molecules, acids, gases, and solutions to fashionhis creations.
In 1996, Dr. Ozin demonstrated the
self-assembly of crystals with a porous structure in space, under the conditions (such asmicrogravity) found aboard a Space Shuttle.Since then, he has shown how the self-assemblyof many materials can be controlled to producetheir structure.
Dr. Ozin ’s latest achievement involves
structure. Ozin was part of an internationalresearch team that created regular microscopiccavities inside a piece of silicon. This material can transmit light photons in precisely regulatedways. In the future, this material might be used to build incredibly fast computers that function by means of photons instead of electrons!
Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 89The shapes of the water molecule and the
carbon dioxide molecule, as shown in the diagram you have seen, make sense based onwhat we know about electron pairs. Theseshapes have also been supported by experi-ment. You will learn more about experimentalevidence for the structure of carbon dioxideand water later in this chapter.

In Figure 3.30, you can see the shape of theammonia, NH

Water molecules are attracted to one another. Because we are surrounded
by water, we are surrounded by evidence of this attraction. Re-examinethe water skier in Figure 3.22. If water molecules did not attract oneanother, do you think the spray from the ski would form a “sheet ” as
shown? Try ﬁlling a glass with water. As you near the rim, add water very
slowly. If you are careful, you can ﬁll the glass so that the water bulges
over the rim. After a rainfall, you have probably seen beads of water onthe surface of vehicles. In Figure 3.32, you can see further evidence of the attraction of water molecules to one another.
Why do water molecules “stick together ”? To answer this question,
you need to consider both the nature of the bonds within a water molecule and its shape.
The Polar Water Molecule
First consider the shape of a water molecule. You have discovered that
a water molecule has a bent shape. Each oxygen-hydrogen bond is polar.The hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom hasa partial negative charge. You know that the bonds are polar, but whatabout the molecule as a whole? Because the molecule is bent, there is apartial negative charge on the oxygen end and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen end, as shown in Figure 3.33.

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 91Because the water molecule as a whole has a partial negative charge on
one end and a partial positive charge on the other end, it is called a polar
molecule . Because water is polar, its negative and positive ends attract
each other. This explains why liquid water “sticks ” to itself. Figure 3.34
shows how water molecules attract each other in the liquid state.
The negative ends of water molecules attracts
the positive ends. Some of the resulting intermolecular forces are shown here.
Two other examples of polar molecules are ammonia and hydrogen
chloride, shown in Figures 3.35 and 3.36. Polar molecules are also calleddipolar molecules because they have a negative pole and a positive pole.
The Non-Polar Carbon Dioxide Molecule
The bond between carbon and oxygen is polar. It has an electronegativity
difference of 1.0. Does this mean that carbon dioxide, a molecule that contains two carbon-oxygen double bonds, is a polar molecule? No, itdoes not. The oxygen atoms have partial negative charges, and the carbon atom has a partial positive charge. The molecule, however, isstraight and symmetrical. As you can see in Figure 3.37, the effects of the polar bonds cancel each other out. Therefore, while carbon dioxidecontains polar bonds, it is a non-polar molecule . It has neither a positive
pole nor a negative pole.
Carbon dioxide is a non-polar molecule because it is symmetrical.
Carbon tetra ﬂuoride, CF4, shown in Figure 3.38, is another example of a
non-polar molecule that contains polar bonds.Figure 3.37

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 93 Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 93Properties of Polar and Non-Polar Molecules
Because water is made up of polar molecules with positive and negative
ends that attract one another, water tends to “stick ” to itself. This means
that it has a high melting point and boiling point, relative to other cova-lent compounds. For example, carbon dioxide is made up of non-polarmolecules. These molecules do not attract each other as much as polarmolecules do, because they do not have positive and negative poles.Compounds that are made up of non-polar molecules generally havelower melting points and boiling points than compounds that are madeup of polar molecules. In fact, compounds with non-polar molecules, like carbon dioxide, are often gases at room temperature.
Section Wrap-up
In section 3.2, you learned about the strong bonds that hold ions in clear-ly-de ﬁned lattice patterns. You learned that these bonds are responsible
for the properties of ionic compounds. You also learned how to describethe properties of compounds that are made up of molecules with covalentbonds. In this section, you discovered that the properties of compoundswith polar covalent bonds depend on their shape.

In sections 3.2 and 3.3, you learned how to represent compounds
using Lewis structures and molecular models. In the next section, youwill learn how chemists name compounds and represent them using symbols.Differences in melting points
and boiling points are due in part to the polarity of themolecules that make up thecompounds. They are also due to the different masses of the individual molecules.FACTCHEM

3.4
You have used Lewis structures to demonstrate how ionic and covalent
bonds form between atoms. When given two elements, you determinedhow many atoms of each element bond together to form a compound,according to the octet rule. For example, you used the periodic table andyour understanding of the octet rule to determine how calcium andbromine bond to form an ionic compound. Using a Lewis structure, youdetermined that calcium and bromine form a compound that contains two bromine atoms for every calcium atom, as shown in Figure 3.39.
Chemical Formulas
Lewis structures are helpful for keeping track of electron transfers inbonding and for making sure that the octet rule is obeyed. As well, Lewis structures can be used to help determine the ratio of the atoms in a compound. To communicate this ratio, chemists use a special kind ofshorthand called a chemical formula . A chemical formula provides two
important pieces of information:
1.the elements that make up the compound
2.the number of atoms of each element that are present in a compound
The order in which the elements are written also communicates important
information. The less electronegative element or ion is usually listed ﬁrst
in the formula, and the more electronegative element or ion comes sec-ond. For example, the ionic compound that is formed from calcium andbromine is written CaBr
2. Calcium, a metal with low electronegativity, is
written ﬁrst. The subscript 2 after the bromine indicates that there are two
bromine atoms for every calcium atom. Writing Chemical Formulas and

96 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingWhat a Chemical Formula Represents
For covalent compounds, the chemical formula represents how many of
each type of atom are in each molecule. For example, the formula NH 3
signi ﬁes that a molecule of ammonia contains one nitrogen atom and
three hydrogen atoms. The formula C2H6tells you that a molecule of
propane contains two atoms of carbon and six atoms of hydrogen.
For ionic compounds, the formula represents a ratio rather than
a discrete particle . For example, the formula for magnesium oxide, MgO,
signi ﬁes that magnesium and oxygen exist in a one-to-one atomic ratio.
Recall that MgO exists in a lattice structure held together by ionic bonds,as shown in Figure 3.41. The formula MgO represents the ratio in whichions are present in the compound.
Using Valence Numbers to Describe Bonding Capacity
You have seen how Lewis structures can help you draw models of ionic,covalent, and polar covalent compounds. When you draw a Lewis structure, you can count how many electrons are needed by each atom to achieve a stable octet. Thus, you can ﬁnd out the ratio in which the
atoms combine. Once you know the ratio of the atoms, you can write thechemical formula of the compound. Drawing Lewis structures can becomeoverwhelming, however, when you are dealing with large molecules. Isthere a faster and easier method for writing chemical formulas?
Every element has a certain capacity to combine with other atoms.
An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element, for example, has the capacity to loseone electron from its valence level in order to bond with another atom. A number is assigned to each element to describe the element ’s bonding
capacity. This number is called the valence . Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements,
such as sodium and lithium, have a valence of +1. The 1 indicates that
these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. This makessense, because Group 1 elements have only one electron in their outerelectron energy level. The +indicates that these elements tend to give up
their electrons, becoming positively charged ions. They may transfer theirelectrons, or they may attract the electron relatively weakly in a polarcovalent bond.
On the other hand, Group 17 (VIIA) elements (the halogens) have a
valence of −1. Again, the 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one
electron involved in bonding. However, they need to gain an electron to
achieve a stable octet. In general, halogens become more negativelycharged when they participate in bonding.
As a general rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence tells
you the charges on the ions that are formed. If a covalent bond is formed,the valence tells you how many electrons the atoms contribute to thecovalent bond.
You can use the periodic table to predict valence numbers. For
example, Group 2 (IIA) elements have two electrons in their outer energylevel. To achieve a stable octet, they need to lose these two electrons.Therefore, the valence for all Group 2 elements is +2.

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 97The smaller atoms of elements in the ﬁrst two periods usually have only
one common valence, which is easily determined from the periodic table.Many larger elements, however, have more than one valence because theelectron distribution in these elements is much more complex. Therefore,you will have to memorize the valences of the elements that are common-ly used in this course. Some useful valences are listed in Table 3.3, withthe most common valences listed ﬁrst.
Table 3.3 Common Valences of Selected Elements
Polyatomic Ions
Some compounds contain ions that are made from more than one atom.
These ions are called polyatomic ions . (The pre ﬁx poly means “many. ”)
Calcium carbonate, CaCO 3, which is found in chalk, contains one calcium
cation and one polyatomic anion called carbonate, CO32−.
Polyatomic ions are in fact charged molecules . For example, the car-
bonate ion consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to three oxygenatoms. The entire molecule has a charge of −2. Therefore, its valence is −2,
as well. Polyatomic ions remain unchanged in simple chemical reactionsbecause of the strong bonds that hold the component atoms together. Theybehave as a single unit and should be treated as a single ion.
Table 3.4 on the next page gives the valences, formulas, and names of
many common polyatomic ions.1

The most common polyatomic cation is the ammonium ion, [ NH 4+].
The ﬁve atoms in NH 4+form a particle with a +1 charge. Because the
atoms are bonded together strongly, the polyatomic ion is not altered inmost chemical reactions. For example, when ammonium chloride is dissolved in water, the only ions in the solution are ammonium ions andchloride ions.

Writing Chemical Formulas Using Valences
You can use valences to write chemical formulas. This method is faster
than using Lewis structures to determine chemical formulas. As well, you can use this method for both ionic and covalent compounds. In orderto write a chemical formula using valences, you need to know which elements (or polyatomic ions) are in the compound, and their valences.You also need to know how to use the zero sum rule : For neutral chemi-
cal formulas containing ions, the sum of positive valences plus negativevalences of the atoms in a compound must equal zero .
In the compound potassium ﬂuoride, KF, each potassium ion has a
charge of +1. Each ﬂuoride ion has a charge of –1. Because there is one of
each ion in the formula, the sum of the valences is zero.Valence = −1

98 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingIt is important to learn the
names and valences of the ﬁve
most common polyatomic ions:nitrate, carbonate, chlorate,sulfate, and phosphate. Theseions form many of the chemi-cals in nature and in commonuse. While the task seemsoverwhelming, it may help tolearn the “big ﬁve” using a
mnemonic, or memory aid. Youcan use the followingmnemonic to remember theirnames, valences, and numberof oxygen atoms:
NICK the CAMEL had a CLAM
for SUPPER in PHOENIX.
The ﬁrst letter identi ﬁes the
polyatomic ion. The number ofvowels represents the valence.The number of consonantsrepresents the number of oxy-gen atoms. For example, NICK(nitrate) has three consonantsand one vowel. Therefore,nitrate contains three oxygenatoms and has a valence of
−1.
(All of these valences are negative.)

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 99What is the formula of a compound that consists of magnesium and
chlorine? You know that the valence of magnesium, Mg, is +2. Thevalence of chlorine, Cl, is −1. The formula MgCl is not balanced, however,
because it does not yet obey the zero sum rule. How can you balance thisformula? You might be able to see, at a glance, that two chlorine atoms areneeded for every magnesium atom. If it is not obvious how to balance aformula, you can follow these steps:
You can check your formula by drawing a Lewis structure, as shown in

How do you write and balance formulas that contain polyatomic ions?
The same steps can be used, as long as you keep the atoms that belong toa polyatomic ion together. The easiest way to do this is to place bracketsaround the polyatomic ion at the beginning.

Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 101Naming Chemical Compounds
When writing a chemical formula, you learned that you write the metal
element ﬁrst. Similarly, the metal comes ﬁrst when naming a chemical
compound. For example, sodium chloride is formed from the metal sodium and the non-metal chlorine. Think of other names you have seenin this chapter, such as beryllium chloride, calcium oxide, and aluminumoxide. In each case, the metal is ﬁrst and the non-metal is second. In other
words, the cation is ﬁrst and the anion is second. This is just one of the
rules in chemical nomenclature : the system that is used in chemistry for
naming compounds.
A chemical formula identi ﬁes a speci ﬁc chemical compound because
it reveals the composition of the compound. Similarly, the name of a compound distinguishes the compound from all other compounds.
Many common chemicals have trivial, or common, names.
In the early days of chemistry, there were no rules for naming compounds.Often, compounds received the names of people or places. Some of theoriginal names are still used today. They are called trivial or common
names because they tell little or nothing about the chemistry of the compounds. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO
3, is commonly known
as saltpetre. The Greek word for rock is petra, and saltpetre is a salt foundcrusted on rocks. The chemical name of a compound of ammonium andchloride ions, is ammonium chloride NH
4Cl. Long before NH 4Clreceived
this name, however, people commonly referred to it as sal ammoniac.They mined this ionic compound near the ancient Egyptian temple ofAmmon in Libya. The name sal ammoniac literally means “salt of
Ammon. ” Figure 3.43 shows other examples of common (trivial) names
for familiar compounds.
Early chemists routinely gave trivial names to substances before
understanding their chemical structure and behaviour. This situationchanged during the mid- to late-1800s. By this time, chemistry was ﬁrmly established as a science. Chemists observed and discovered new
patterns of chemical relationships (such as periodicity). As well, chemistsdiscovered new chemical compounds with tremendous frequency. Therapidly increasing number of chemical compounds required a more organized method of nomenclature.Figure 3.43
102 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) was
formed in 1919 by a group of chemists. The main aim of IUPAC was toestablish international standards for masses, measurement, names, andsymbols used in the discipline of chemistry. To further that aim, IUPACdeveloped, and continues to develop, a consistent and thorough system of nomenclature for compounds.
Table 3.5 contains the IUPAC names of selected common compounds
as well as their common names.
Table 3.5 Common Chemical Compounds
Naming Binary Compounds Containing a Metal and a Non-metal
A binary compound is an inorganic compound that contains two elements.
Binary compounds may contain a metal and a non-metal or two non-metals. Binary compounds are often ionic compounds. To name a binaryionic compound, name the cation ﬁrst and the anion second. For example,
the compound that contains sodium and chlorine is called sodium chlo-ride.
In the subsections that follow, you will examine the rules for naming
metals and non-metals in binary compounds.
Naming Metals in Chemical Compounds: The Stock System
The less electronegative element in a binary compound is always named
ﬁrst. Often this element is a metal. You use the same name as the element.
For example, sodium chloride, NaCl, calcium oxide, CaO, and zinc
sulﬁde, ZnS, contain the metals sodium, calcium, and zinc.
Many of the common metals are transition elements that have more
than one possible valence. For example, tin is able to form the ions Sn
2+
and Sn4+, iron can form Fe2+and Fe3+, and copper can form Cu+and
Cu2+. (The most common transition metals with more than one valence
number are listed in Table 3.3.) The name of a compound must identifywhich ion is present in the compound. To do this, the element ’s name is
used, followed by the valence in parentheses, written in Roman numerals.Therefore, Sn
4+is tin(IV), Fe3+is iron(III), and Cu2+is copper(II). This
naming method is called the Stock system after Alfred Stock, a German
chemist who ﬁrst used it. Some examples of Stock system names are
listed in Table 3.6.Al2O3

Common name
Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 103Another Method for Naming Metals with Two Valences
In a method that predates the Stock system, two different endings are
used to distinguish the valences of metals. The ending - icis used to repre-
sent the larger valence number. The ending - ousis used to represent
the smaller valence number. Thus, the ions Sn2+and Sn4+are named
stann ousion and stann icion. To use this system, you need to know the
Latin name of an element. For example, the two ions of lead are theplumbous and plumbic ions. See Table 3.6 for more examples.
This naming method has several drawbacks. Many metals have more
than two oxidation numbers. For example, chromium can form three different ions, and manganese can form ﬁve different ions. Another draw-
back is that the name does not tell you what the valence of the metal is. It only tells you that the valence is the smaller or larger of two.
Table 3.6 Two ways to Name Cations with Two Valences
Naming Non-Metals in Chemical Compounds
To distinguish the non-metal from the metal in the name of a chemical
compound, the non-metal (or more electronegative element) is alwayswritten second. Its ending changes to - ide.For example, hydrogen changes
to hydride , carbon changes to carbide , sulfur changes to sulﬁde , and
iodine changes to iodide .
Putting It All Together
To name a binary compound containing metal and a non-metal, write the
name of the metal ﬁrst and the name of the non-metal second. For exam-
ple, a compound that contains potassium as the cation and bromine as theanion is called potassium bromide . Be sure to indicate the valence if
necessary, using the Stock system. For example, a compound that contains
Pb
2+and oxygen is called lead(II) oxide .Cu+

called calcium sulfate dihy-drate. Can you see the pattern?Try naming MgSO
4•7H2O. Use
Table 3.8 to help you. You willlearn more about hydrates in Chapter 6.
104 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingNaming Compounds That Contain Hydrogen
If a binary compound contains hydrogen as the less electronegative
element, “hydrogen ” is used ﬁrst in the name of the compound. For
example, HCl is called hydrogen chloride and H2Sis called hydrogen
sulﬁde . Sometimes hydrogen can be the anion, usually in a compound
that contains a Group 1 metal. If hydrogen is the anion, its ending must be changed to - ide. For example, NaH is called sodium hydride and LiH
is called lithium hydride . Hydrogen-containing compounds can also be
formed with the Group 15 elements. These compounds are usuallyreferred to by their common names as opposed to their IUPAC names. Forexample, NH
3is called ammonia , PH3is called phosphine , AsH 3is called
arsine , and SbH 3is called stibine .
Many compounds that contain hydrogen are also acids. For example,
H2SO4, hydrogen sulfate, is also called sulfuric acid. You will learn about
acid nomenclature in Chapter 10.
Naming Compounds That Contain Polyatomic Ions
Many compounds contain one or more polyatomic ions. Often these compounds contain three elements, in which case they are called tertiary
compounds . Although they are not binary compounds, they still contain
one type of anion and one type of cation. The same naming rules thatapply to binary compounds apply to these compounds as well. For example, NH
4Clis called ammonium chloride . Na2SO4is called sodium
sulfate . NiSO 4is called nickel(II) sulfate . NH 4NO 3is called ammonium
nitrate .
The non-metals in the periodic table are greatly outnumbered by the
metals. There are many negatively charged polyatomic ions, however, to make up for this. In fact, polyatomic anions are commonly found ineveryday chemicals. Refer back to Table 3.4 for the names of the mostcommon polyatomic anions.
When you are learning the names of polyatomic ions, you will notice
a pattern. For example, consider the polyatomic ions that contain chlorineand oxygen:
ClO
−hypochlorite
ClO 2−chlorite
ClO 3−chlorate
ClO 4−perchlorate
Can you see the pattern? Each ion has the same valence, but differentnumbers of oxygen atoms. The base ion is the one with the “ate” ending
chlorate. It contains three oxygen atoms. When the ending is changed to “ite,” subtract an oxygen atom from the chlorate ion. The resulting
chlorite ion contains two oxygen atoms. Add “hypo ” to “chlorite, ” and
subtract one more oxygen atom. The resulting hypochlorite ion has one22.Write the IUPAC name for each compound.

(b)HCl (e)CaH 2
(c)HF (f)PH3Practice Problems
Chapter 3  Chemical Compounds and Bonding • MHR 105oxygen atom. Adding “per” to “chlorate, ” means that you should add an
oxygen to the chlorate ion. The perchlorate ion has four oxygen atoms.
The base “ate” ions do not always have three oxygen atoms like
chlorate does. Consider the polyatomic ions that contain sulfur and oxygen. In this case, the base ion, sulfate, SO
42−, contains four oxygen
atoms. The sul ﬁte ion, SO32−, therefore contains three oxygen atoms.
The hyposul ﬁte ion, SO22−, contains two oxygen atoms. Once you know
the meanings of the pre ﬁxes and suf ﬁxes, you need only memorize the
formulas of the “ate” ions. You can work out the formulas for the related
ions using their pre ﬁxes and suf ﬁxes. The meanings of the pre ﬁxes and
sufﬁxes are summarized in Table 3.7. In this table, the “x” stands for the
number of oxygen atoms in the “ate” ion.

Table 3.8 Numerical Pre ﬁxes for
Binary Compounds That ContainTwo Non-MetalsNaming Binary Compounds That Contain Two Non-Metals
To indicate that a binary compound is made up of two non-metals, a preﬁx is usually added to both non-metals in the compound. This pre ﬁx
indicates the number of atoms of each element in one molecule or formu-
la unit of the compound. For example, P
2O5is named diphosphorus pen-
toxide . Alternatively, the Stock System may be used, and P2O5can be
named phosphorus (V) oxide . AsBr 3is named phosphorus tribromide.
The pre ﬁx mono - is often left out when there is only one atom of the ﬁrst
element in the name. A list of numerical pre ﬁxes is found in Table 3.8.The pre ﬁx “thio” in the name
of a polyatomic ion means thatan oxygen atom in the root“ate” ion has been replaced
by a sulfur atom. For example,the sulfate ion is SO
42−, while
the thiosulfate ion is S2O32−.

Picture a starry night and tired hikers sitting around a campﬁre.
Everywhere in this peaceful setting, chemical reactions are taking place.The cellulose in the ﬁrewood reacts with the oxygen in the air, producingcarbon dioxide and water. The light and heat of the campﬁre are evidenceof the chemical reaction. If someone roasts a marshmallow its sugars reactwith oxygen. The soft, white marshmallow forms a brown and brittlecrust. When someone eats a marshmallow, the chemicals in the stomachreact with the sugar molecules to digest them. A person telling a storyexhales carbon dioxide with every breath. Carbon dioxide is the productof respiration, another chemical reaction.
In each star in the night sky above, another type of reaction is taking
place. This type of reaction is called a nuclear reaction , because it
involves changes within the nucleus of the atom. Nuclear reactions areresponsible for the enormous amounts of heat and light generated by allthe stars, including our Sun.
Back on Earth, however, chemical reactions are everywhere in our
daily lives. We rely on chemical reactions for everything from powering acar to making toast. In this chapter, you will learn how to write balancedchemical equations for these reactions. You will look for patterns and similarities between the chemical equations, and you will classify thereactions they represent. As well, you will learn how to balance and classify equations for nuclear reactions.

Specific Expectations  In Chapter 3, you learned how and why elements combine to form
different compounds. In this section, you will learn how to describe what happens when elements and compounds interact with one anotherto form new substances. These interactions are called chemical reactions .
A substance that undergoes a chemical reaction is called a reactant . A
substance that is formed in a chemical reaction is called a product .
For example, when the glucose in a marshmallow reacts with oxygen
in the air to form water and carbon dioxide, the glucose and oxygen arethe reactants. The carbon dioxide and water are the products. Chemistsuse chemical equations to communicate what is occurring in a chemical
reaction. Chemical equations come in several forms. All of these formscondense a great deal of chemical information into a short statement.
Word Equations
A word equation identiﬁes the reactants and products of a chemical
reaction by name. In Chapter 3, you learned that chlorine and sodiumcombine to form the ionic compound sodium chloride. This reaction canbe represented by the following word equation:
sodium+chlorine →sodium chloride
In this equation, “ +” means “reacts with” and “ →” means “to form.” Try
writing some word equations in the following Practice Problems.Chemical Equations

(e)Sulfur dioxide and oxygen react to form sulfur trioxide.
2.Yeast can facilitate a reaction in which the sugar in grapes reacts toform ethanol and carbon dioxide. Write a word equation to describethis reaction. Practice Problems
Word equations are useful because they identify the products and
reactants in a chemical reaction. They do not, however, provide anychemical information about the compounds and elements themselves. If you did not know the formula for sodium chloride, for example, thisequation would not help you understand the reaction very well. Anothershortcoming of a word equation is that the names for chemicals are oftenvery long and cumbersome. Chemists have therefore devised a more convenient way of representing reactants and products.
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 113Skeleton Equations
Using a chemical formula instead of a chemical name simpliﬁes a
chemical equation. It allows you to see at a glance what elements andcompounds are involved in the reaction. A skeleton equation lists the
chemical formula of each reactant on the left, separated by a +sign
if more than one reactant is involved, followed by an arrow →. The
chemical formula of each product is listed on the right, again separated by a +sign if more than one product is produced. A skeleton equation
also shows the state of each reactant by using the appropriate subscript, as shown in Table 4.1.
The reaction of sodium metal with chlorine gas to form sodium
chloride can be represented by the following skeleton equation:
Na
(s)+Cl2(g)→NaCl (s)
A skeleton equation is more useful to a chemist than a word equation,
because it shows the formulas of the compounds involved. It also showsthe state of each substance.Try writing some skeleton equations in the following Practice Problems.Symbol Meaning

Why Skeleton Equations Are Incomplete
Although skeleton equations are useful, they do not fully describe chemi-
cal reactions. To understand why, consider the skeleton equation showingthe formation of sodium chloride (above). According to this equation, onesodium atom reacts with one chlorine molecule containing two chlorineatoms. The product is one formula unit of sodium chloride, containingone atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine. Where has the extra chlorine atom gone?
The Law of Conservation of Mass
All atoms must be accounted for, according to an important law. The law
of conservation of mass states that in any chemical reaction, the mass
of the products is always equal to the mass of the reactants . In other
words, according to this law, matter can be neither created nor destroyed.Chemical reactions proceed according to the law of conservation of mass,which is based on experimental evidence.
114 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingJan Baptista van Helmont
(1577–1644) was a Flemishphysician who left medicalpractice to devote himself to the study of chemistry. Heused the mass balance in animportant experiment that laidthe foundations for the law of conservation of mass. He showed that a deﬁnitequantity of sand could be fusedwith excess alkali to form akind of glass. He also showedthat when this product wastreated with acid, it regenerat-ed the original amount of sand(silica). As well, Van Helmont isfamous for demonstrating theexistence of gases, which hedescribed as “aerial ﬂuids.”Investigate on the Internet orin the library to ﬁnd out how hedid this.LINKHistoryCareers in Chemistry

How do you make a better tasting sports drink?
How can you make a gravy mix that can be readyto serve in 5 min, yet maintain its consistencyunder a heat lamp for 8 h? Food chemists usetheir knowledge of chemical reactions to improvefood quality and develop new products.
A good example of food chemistry in action
is the red pimento stufﬁng in olives. Choppedpimentos (sweet red peppers) and sodium algi-nate are mixed. This mixture is then added to asolution of calcium chloride. The sodium alginatereacts with the calcium chloride. Solid calciumalginate forms, which causes the stream of
pimento mixture to form a gel instantly. Thegelled strip is then sliced thinly and stuffed intothe olives.
Food chemists work in universities, govern-
ment laboratories, and major food companies. Tobecome a food chemist, most undergraduatestake a food science degree with courses in chem-istry. It is also possible to become a food chemistwith an undergraduate chemistry degree plusexperience in the food industry. Students canspecialize in food chemistry at the graduate level.

Balanced Chemical Equations
A balanced chemical equation reﬂects the law of conservation of mass.
This type of equation shows that there is the same number of each kind of atom on both sides of the equation. Some skeleton equations are, bycoincidence, already balanced. For example, examine the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, shown in Figure 4.1. In theskeleton equation, one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms are on the leftside of the equation, and one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms are onthe right side of the equation.
This skeleton equation is already balanced. Figure 4.1
C+ +++
O2 CO2
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 115Most skeleton equations, however, are not balanced, such as the one
showing the formation of sodium chloride. Examine Figure 4.2 to seewhy. There is one sodium atom on each side of the equation, but there are two chlorine atoms on the left side and only one chlorine atom on the right side.
To begin to balance an equation, you can add numbers in front of the
appropriate formulas. The numbers that are placed in front of chemicalformulas are called coefﬁcients . They represent how many of each atom,
molecule, or formula unit take part in each reaction. For example, if youadd a coef ﬁcient of 2 to NaCl in the equation in Figure 4.2, you indicate
that two formula units of NaCl are produced in the reaction. Is the equa-tion balanced now? As you can see by examining Figure 4.3, it is not. Thechlorine atoms are balanced, but now there is one sodium atom on the left side of the equation and two sodium atoms on the right side.
This skeleton equation is unbalanced. The mass
of the reactants is greater than the mass of the product.
Add a coef ﬁcient of 2 to the sodium on the reactant side. As you can
see in Figure 4.4, the equation is now balanced. The mass of the productsis equal to the mass of the reactants. This balanced chemical equation satisﬁes the law of conservation of mass.
The equation is now balanced according to the law of conservation of mass. Figure 4.4

The equation is still unbalanced. The mass of
the product is now greater than the mass of the reactants.Figure 4.3

116 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingYou cannot balance an equation by changing any of the chemical
formulas. The only way to balance a chemical equation is to put the
appropriate numerical coef ﬁcient in front of each compound or element
in the equation.
Many skeleton equations are simple enough to balance by a back-and-
forth process of reasoning, as you just saw with the sodium chloride reaction. Try balancing the equations in the Practice Problems that follow.

Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations
More complex chemical equations than the ones you have already tried
can be balanced by using a combination of inspection and trial and error.Here, however, are some steps to follow.
Examine the following Sample Problem to see how these steps work.Step 1 Write out the skeleton equation. Ensure that you have copied
all the chemical formulas correctly.
Step 2 Begin by balancing the atoms that occur in the largest numberon either side of the equation. Leave hydrogen, oxygen, andother elements until later.
Step 3 Balance any polyatomic ions, such as sulfate, SO42−, that occur
on both sides of the chemical equation as an ion unit. That is,do not split a sulfate ion into 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygenatoms. Balance this ion as one unit.
Step 4 Next, balance any hydrogen or oxygen atoms that occur in a combined and uncombined state. For example, combined oxygen might be in the form of CO
2, while uncombined
oxygen occurs as O2.
Step 5 Finally, balance any other element that occurs in its
uncombined state: for example, Na or Cl2.
Step 6 Check your answer. Count the number of each type of atom on
each side of the equation. Make sure that the coef ﬁcients used
are whole numbers in their lowest terms. Go to the Chemistry 11

How are different kinds of compounds formed? In section 4.1, you
learned that they are formed by chemical reactions that you can describeusing balanced chemical equations. Just as there are different types ofcompounds, there are different types of chemical reactions. In this section, you will learn about ﬁve major classi ﬁcations for chemical
reactions. You will use your understanding of chemical formulas andchemical equations to predict products for each class of reaction.
Why Classify?
People use classi ﬁcations all the time. For example, many types of wild
mushrooms are edible, but many others are poisonous —even deadly! How
can you tell which is which? Poisonous and deadly mushrooms havecharacteristics that distinguish them from edible ones, such as odour,colour, habitat, and shape of roots. It is not always easy to distinguish one type of mushroom from another; the only visible difference may bethe colour of the mushroom ’s spores. Therefore, you should never try to
eat any wild mushrooms without an expert ’s advice.
Examine Figure 4.5. Which mushroom looks more appetizing to you?
An expert will always be able to distinguish an edible mushroom from apoisonous mushroom based on the characteristics that have been used toclassify each type. By classifying, they can predict the effects of eating anywild mushroom.
The mushroom on the left, called a
chanterelle, is edible and very tasty. The mushroom on the right is called a death cap. It is extremely poisonous. Figure 4.5

reactions and the types of reactants that tend to undergo different types of reactions. With this knowledge, you can predict what will happenwhen one, two, or more substances react. In this section, you will oftensee chemical reactions without the subscripts showing the states of matter.They are omitted deliberately because, in most cases, you are not yet in aposition to predict the states of the products.
Synthesis Reactions
In a synthesis reaction , two or more elements or compounds combine to
form a new substance. Synthesis reactions are also known as combinationor formation reactions. A general equation for a synthesis reaction is
A+B→C
In a simple synthesis reaction, one element reacts with one or more other
elements to form a compound . Two, three, four, or more elements may
react to form a single product, although synthesis reactions involving fouror more reactants are extremely rare. Why do you think this is so? Whentwo elements react together, the reaction is almost always a synthesisreaction because the product is almost always a single compound. Thereare several types of synthesis reactions. Recognizing the patterns of thevarious types of reactions will help you to predict whether substanceswill take part in a synthesis reaction.
When a metal or a non-metal element reacts with oxygen, the product
is an oxide. Figure 4.6 shows a familiar example, in which iron reactswith oxygen according to the following equation:
3Fe
(s)+O2(g)→Fe2O3(s)
Two other examples of this type of reaction are:
2H2(g)+O2(g)→2H2O(g)
2Mg (s)+O2(g)→2MgO (s)
A second type of synthesis reaction involves the reaction of a metal and
a non-metal to form a binary compound. One example is the reaction ofpotassium with chlorine.
2K
(s)+Cl2(g)→2KCl (s)
The iron in this car
undergoes a synthesis reactionwith the oxygen in the air. Iron(III)oxide, also known as rust, isformed.Figure 4.6
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 121Synthesis Reactions Involving Compounds
In the previous two types of synthesis reactions, two elements reacted to
form one product. There are many synthesis reactions in which one ormore compounds are the reactants. For the purpose of this course, howev-er, we will deal only with the two speci ﬁc types of synthesis reactions
involving compounds that you should recognize: oxides and water.
When a non-metallic oxide reacts with water, the product is an
acid. You will learn more about acids and the rules for naming them inChapter 10. The acids that form when non-metallic oxides and water reactare composed of hydrogen cations and polyatomic anions containing oxygen and a non-metal. For example, one contributor to acid rain ishydrogen sulfate (sulfuric acid), H
2SO4, which forms when sulfur trioxide
reacts with water. The sulfur trioxide comes from sources such as industrial plants that emit the gas as a byproduct of burning fossil fuels,as shown in Figure 4.7.
SO
3(g)+H2O(/lscript)→H2SO4(aq)
Sulfur trioxide, emitted by this factory, reacts with the water in the air.
Sulfuric acid is formed in a synthesis reaction.
Conversely, when a metallic oxide reacts with water, the product is a
metal hydroxide. Metal hydroxides belong to a group of compounds calledbases. You will learn more about bases in Chapter 10. For example, whencalcium oxide reacts with water, it forms calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)
2.
Calcium oxide is also called lime. It can be added to lakes to counteractthe effects of acid precipitation.
CaO
(s)+H2O(/lscript)→Ca(OH) 2(aq)
Sometimes it is dif ﬁcult to predict the product of a synthesis reaction.
The only way to really know the product of a reaction is to carry out thereaction and then isolate and identify the product. For example, carboncan react with oxygen to form either carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.Therefore, if all you know is that your reactants are carbon and oxygen,you cannot predict with certainty which compound will form. You canonly give options.
C
(s)+O2(g)→CO2(g)
2C(s)+O2(g)→2CO (g)
You would need to analyze the products of the reaction by experiment to
determine which compound was formed.Figure 4.7
Today we have sophisticated
lab equipment to help us ana-lyze the products of reactions.In the past, when such equip-ment was not available,chemists sometimes jeopard-ized their safety and health todetermine the products of thereactions they studied. SirHumphry Davy (1778–1829), a contributor to many areas of chemistry, thought nothing of inhaling the gaseous prod-ucts of the chemical reactionsthat he carried out. He tried to breathe pure CO
2, then
known as ﬁxed air . He nearly
suffocated himself by breath-ing hydrogen. In 1800, Davyinhaled dinitrogen monoxide,
N
2O, otherwise known as
nitrous oxide, and discoveredits anaesthetic properties.What is nitrous oxide used for today?LINKHistory

Decomposition Reactions
In a decomposition reaction , a compound breaks down into elements or
other compounds. Therefore, a decomposition reaction is the opposite of
a synthesis reaction . A general formula for a decomposition reaction is:
C→A+B
The substances that are produced in a decomposition reaction can be
elements or compounds. In the simplest type of decomposition reaction, a compound breaks down into its component elements. One example isthe decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. This reactionoccurs when electricity is passed through water. Figure 4.8 shows anapparatus set up for the decomposition of water.
2H
2O→2H2+O2
More complex decomposition reactions occur when compounds break
down into other compounds. An example of this type of reaction is shown in Figure 4.9. The photograph shows the explosive decompositionof ammonium nitrate.
As electricity passes
through the water, it decomposesto hydrogen and oxygen gas.Figure 4.8

Combustion Reactions
Combustion reactions form an important class of chemical reactions.The combustion of fuel —wood, fossil fuel, peat, or dung —has,
throughout history, heated and lit our homes and cooked our food. The energy produced by combustion reactions moves our airplanes,trains, trucks, and cars.
A complete combustion reaction is the reaction of a compound or
element with O
2to form the most common oxides of the elements that
make up the compound. For example, a carbon-containing compoundundergoes combustion to form carbon dioxide, CO
2. A sulfur-contain-
ing compound reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide, SO2.
Combustion reactions are usually accompanied by the production
of light and heat. In the case of carbon-containing compounds, complete combustion results in the formation of, among other things,carbon dioxide. For example, methane, CH
4, the primary constituent
of natural gas, undergoes complete combustion to form carbon dioxide,(the most common oxide of carbon), as well as water. This combustionreaction is represented by the following equation:
CH
4(g)+2O2(g)→CO2(g)+2H2O(g)
The combustion of methane, shown in Figure 4.10, leads to the formation
of carbon dioxide and water.
The complete combustion of any compound that contains carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen (such as ethanol, C2H5OH) produces carbon
dioxide and water.Practice Problems
This photo shows
the combustion of methane in alaboratory burner.Figure 4.10
At high temperatures,
ammonium nitrate explodes,decomposing into dinitrogen monoxide and water.Figure 4.9
124 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingCompounds that contain elements other than carbon also undergo
complete combustion to form stable oxides. For instance, sulfur-contain-ing compounds undergo combustion to form sulfur dioxide, SO
2, a
precursor to acid rain. Complete combustion reactions are often also synthesis reactions. Metals, such as magnesium, undergo combustion to form their most stable oxide, as shown in Figure 4.11.
2Mg
(s)+O2(g)→2MgO (s)
Magnesium metal burns in oxygen. The smoke
and ash that are produced in this combustion reaction are magnesium oxide.
In the absence of suf ﬁcient oxygen, carbon-containing compounds under-
go incomplete combustion , leading to the formation of carbon monoxide,
CO, and water. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas. You should always makesure that suf ﬁcient oxygen is present in your indoor environment for your
gas furnace, gas stove, or ﬁreplace.
Try the following problems to practise balancing combustion
reactions.Figure 4.11
Copy the following skeleton
equation for the combustion of pentane, C

balance this equation, chancesare that you did not use thequickest method. Try balancingcarbon ﬁrst, hydrogen second,and ﬁnally oxygen. What is theadvantage of leaving O
2until
the end? Would this methodwork for incomplete combus-tion reactions? Would thismethod work if the “fuel” contained oxygen in addition to C and H? Now try balancingthe chemical equation for thecombustion of heptane ( C

Specific Expectations  In section 4.2, you learned about three different types of chemical reactions.
In section 4.3, you will learn about two more types of reactions. You willlearn how performing these reactions can help you make inferences aboutthe properties of the elements and compounds involved.
Single Displacement Reactions
In a single displacement reaction , one element in a compound is
displaced (or replaced) by another element. Two general reactions represent two different types of single displacement reactions. One typeinvolves a metal replacing a metal cation in a compound, as follows:
A+BC→AC+B
For example, Zn
(s)+Fe(NO 3)2(aq)→Zn(NO 3)2(aq)+Fe2(s)
The second type of single displacement reaction involves a non-metal
(usually a halogen) replacing an anion in a compound, as follows:
DE+F→DF+E
For example, Cl2(g)+CaBr 2(aq)→CaCl 2(aq)+Br2(/lscript)
Single Displacement Reactions and the Metal Activity Series
Most single displacement reactions involve one metal displacing another
metal from a compound. In the following equation, magnesium metalreplaces the zinc in ZnCl
2, thereby liberating zinc as the free metal.
Mg(s)+ZnCl 2(aq)→MgCl 2(aq)+Zn(s)
The following three reactions illustrate the various types of single
displacement reactions involving metals:
1.Cu(s)+2AgNO 3(aq)→Cu(NO 3)2(aq)+2Ag (s)
In this reaction, one metal replaces another metal in an ionic
compound . That is, copper replaces silver in AgNO 3. Because of
the +2 charge on the copper ion, it requires two nitrate ions to
balance its charge.
2.Mg(s)+2HCl (aq)→MgCl 2(aq)+H2(g)
In this reaction, magnesium metal replaces hydrogen from
hydrochloric acid, HCl (aq). Since hydrogen is diatomic, it is “liberated ”
in the form of H2. This reaction is similar to reaction 1 if
•you treat hydrochloric acid as an ionic compound (which it techni-
cally is not), and if
•you treat hydrogen as a metal (also, technically, not the case).
3.2Na (s)+2H2O(/lscript)→2NaOH (aq)+H2(g)
Sodium metal displaces hydrogen from water in this reaction. Again,
since hydrogen is diatomic, it is produced as H2. As above, you can
understand this reaction better if
•you treat hydrogen as a metal, and if
•you treat water as an ionic compound, H+(OH−).Single Displacement and
Double Displacement Reactions
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 127All of the reactions just described follow the original general example of a
single displacement reaction:
A+BC→AC+B
Figures 4.12 and 4.13 show two examples of single displacement reactions.
When analyzing single displacement reactions, use the following
guidelines:
•Treat hydrogen as a metal.
•Treat acids, such as HCl, as ionic compounds of the form H+Cl−.
(Treat sulfuric acid, H2SO4, as H+H+SO42−).
•Treat water as ionic, with the formula H+(OH−).
Lithium metal
reacts violently with water in asingle displacement reaction.Lithium must be stored underkerosene or oil to avoid reactionwith atmospheric moisture, or oxygen.Figure 4.12
When an iron nail is placed in a solution of copper(II) sulfate, a single
displacement reaction takes place.
Fe(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→FeSO 4(aq)+Cu(s)
Notice the formation of copper metal on the nail.Figure 4.13

Through experimentation, chemists have ranked the relative reactivity of
the metals, including hydrogen (in acids and in water), in an activity series .
The reactive metals, such as potassium, are at the top of the activity series.The unreactive metals, such as gold, are at the bottom. In Investigation 4-A,you will develop an activity series using single displacement reactions.

Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 129
130 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingThe Metal Activity Series
As you can see in Table 4.2, the more reactive metals are at the top of the
activity series. The less reactive metals are at the bottom. A reactive metal
will displace or replace any metal in a compound that is below it in theactivity series . Metals from lithium to sodium will displace hydrogen as a
gas from water. Metals from magnesium to lead will displace hydrogen asa gas only from acids. Copper, mercury, silver, and gold will not displacehydrogen from acids.
Table 4.2 Activity Series of Metals
You can use the activity series to help you predict the products of the
reaction of a metal and a metal-containing compound. For example, consider the following incomplete equation.
Fe
(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→
You can see from the activity series that iron is above copper. This means
that iron is more reactive than copper. This reaction will proceed.
Fe(s)+CuSO 4(aq)→FeSO 4(aq)+Cu(s)
The copper metal produced is less reactive than iron metal. What about
the following incomplete reaction between silver and calcium chloride?
Ag(s)+CaCl 2(aq)→
Silver is below calcium in the activity series, meaning that it is less
reactive. There would be no reaction between these two substances.Predict whether the substances in the following Practice Problem will react.Most ReactiveDisplaces hydrogen

Cu(NO 3)2(aq)+2Ag (s)
Silver metal is more stable
than copper metal. In otherwords, silver is below copperin the activity series.PROBLEM TIP
Most metals that we use
in everyday life are actuallyalloys. An alloy is a solid solution of one metal (or non-metal) in another metal. Forexample, steel is an alloy ofiron. Steel has many uses, fromconstruction to the automobileindustry. If the iron were notalloyed with other elements, it would not have the physicaland chemical propertiesrequired, such as hardnessand corrosion resistance.FACTCHEM
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 131Single Displacement Reactions Involving Halogens
Non-metals, typically halogens, can also take part in single displacement
reactions. For example, molecular chlorine can replace bromine from KBr,an ionic compound, producing bromine and potassium chloride.
Cl
2(g)+2KBr (aq)→2KCl (aq)+Br2(/lscript)
The activity series for halogens directly mirrors the position of
halogens in the periodic table. It can be shown simply in the followingway. Fluorine is the most reactive, and iodine is the least reactive.
F>Cl>Br>I
In the same way as you used the activity series for metals, you can use theactivity series for halogens to predict whether substances will undergo asingle displacement reaction. For example, ﬂuorine is above chlorine in
the activity series. So, given the reactants ﬂuorine and sodium chloride,
you can predict that the following reaction will occur:
F
2(g)+2NaCl (aq)→2NaF (aq)+Cl2(aq)
On the other hand, iodine is below bromine in the activity series. So,
given the reactants iodine and calcium bromide, you can predict that noreaction will occur.
I
2(aq)+CaBr 2(aq)→NR
Try the following problems to practise using the metal and halogen
activity series to predict whether reactions will occur.

132 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingDouble Displacement Reactions
A double displacement reaction involves the exchange of cations between
two ionic compounds, usually in aqueous (water) solution. A double displacement reaction is also known as a double replacement reaction. A general equation for a double displacement reaction is:
AB+CD→CB+AD
In this equation, A and C are cations and B and D are anions.
Consider the following situation. You have two unlabelled beakers.
One contains distilled water, and the other contains salt water. The twosamples look virtually identical. How can you quickly determine which is the salt water without tasting them? (You should never taste anything in a chemistry laboratory.)
A common test for the presence of chloride ions in water is the
addition of a few drops of silver nitrate solution. The formation of a white solid indicates the presence of chloride ions, as you can see inFigure 4.14.
A double displacement reaction has occurred. That is, the cations
in the reactants have essentially changed places. This switch is modelled in Figure 4.15.
Sodium chloride and silver nitrate form ions in solution. When silver ions
and chloride ions come into contact, they form a solid.
Since silver chloride is virtually insoluble in water, it forms a solid
compound, or precipitate.
Double displacement reactions tend to occur in aqueous solution. Not
all ionic compounds, however, will react with one another in this way.You can tell that a double displacement reaction has taken place in thefollowing cases:
•a solid (precipitate) forms
•a gas is produced
•some double displacement reactions also form a molecular compound,
such as water. It is hard to tell when water is formed, because often thereaction takes place in water.
Double Displacement Reactions that Form a Precipitate
A precipitate is a solid that separates from a solution as the result of a
chemical reaction. You will learn more about precipitates in Chapter 9.Many double displacement reactions involve the formation of a precipitate .
Examine the double displacement reaction that occurs when aqueous
solutions of barium chloride and potassium sulfate are mixed. A whiteprecipitate is immediately formed. The equation for the reaction is
BaCl
2(aq)+K2SO4(aq)→BaSO 4(s)+2KCl (aq)Figure 4.15NaCl (aq)+AgNO 3(aq)→AgCl (s)+NaNO 3(aq)When a few drops
of silver nitrate, AgNO 3, are
added to a sample of salt water,
NaCl (aq), a white precipitate of
silver chloride, AgCl, is formed.Figure 4.14
Chapter 4  Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance • MHR 133You should think about two questions when analyzing a double
displacement reaction.
1.How do we determine the products?
2.Which of the products —if any —will precipitate out of solution?
Barium chloride solution contains Ba2+ions and Cl−ions. Potassium
sulfate solution contains K+and SO42−ions. When they are mixed, the
Ba2+ions come in contact with SO42−ions. Because barium sulfate is
insoluble, the product comes out of solution as a solid. The K+ions and
Cl−ions also come into contact with each other, but potassium chloride is
soluble, so these ions stay in solution.
How do you know that the precipitate is BaSO 4and notKCl? More
generally, how can you predict whether a precipitate will be formed in adouble displacement reaction? In this chapter, you will be given informa-tion on solubility as you need it. You will learn more about how to predict whether a compound is soluble or not in Chapter 9. Barium sulfate, BaSO
4is not soluble in water, while potassium chloride, KCl,
is. Therefore, a reaction will take place and barium sulfate will be the precipitate.
In summary, to determine the products and their physical states in a
double displacement reaction, you must ﬁrst “deconstruct ” the reactants.
Then switch the cations, and “reconstruct ” the products using proper
chemical formulas. You should then balance the chemical equation. Youwill be given information to determine which of the products, if any, willform a precipitate. Finally, you can write the physical state —(s) or (aq) —
of each product and balance the equation.
Given the following reactants, how would you predict the products
of the reaction and their state? Note that many hydroxide compounds,including magnesium hydroxide, are insoluble. Potassium cations formsoluble substances with all anions.

Examine ﬁgure 4.16 to see how to separate the compounds into ions, Mg2+

Double Displacement Reactions That Produce a Gas
In certain cases, you know that a double displacement reaction has
occurred because a gas is produced. The gas is formed when one of theproducts of the double displacement reaction decomposes to give waterand a gas.
Consider the reaction of aqueous sodium carbonate (washing soda)
and hydrochloric acid, shown in Figure 4.17. Hydrochloric acid is sold atthe hardware store under the common name “muriatic acid. ” If you carry
out this reaction, you immediately see the formation of carbon dioxidegas. The ﬁrst reaction that takes place is a double displacement reaction.
Determine the products in the following way. Separate the reactions intoions, and switch the anions. Write chemical formulas for the productsand balance the equation.
Na
2CO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+
But this isn ’t all that is happening! The carbonic acid, H2CO3, is unstable
and subsequently decomposes to carbon dioxide and water.
→H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)
Overall, we can write this two-step reaction as follows:
Na2CO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)
Another double displacement reaction results in the formation of
gaseous ammonia, NH 3. Ammonia, a pungent-smelling gas, is an impor-
tant industrial chemical. It is used as a fertilizer and, when dissolved inwater, as a household cleaner. Ammonium hydroxide is formed in thereaction below
NH
4Cl(aq)+NaOH (aq)→ +NaCl (aq)
The ammonium hydroxide, NH 4OH, immediately decomposes to give
ammonia and water, according to the equation
→NH 3(g)+H2O(/lscript)
Combining these equations gives
NH 4Cl(aq)+NaOH (aq)→NaCl (aq)+NH 3(g)+H2O(/lscript)
This example illustrates the formation of a gas by an initial double
displacement reaction, followed by the decomposition of one of the products to a gas and water.NH 4OH (aq)NH 4OH (aq)H2CO3(aq)H2CO3(aq)

reaction. Write “NR” if you predict that no reaction will occur. Note
that K+, Na+, and Li+ions form soluble compounds with all anions.
All nitrate compounds are soluble. Sulfate compounds with Ca2+,
Sr2+, Ba2+, Ra2+, and Pb2+are insoluble, but most other sulfate
compounds are soluble. Lead(II) iodide is insoluble.

Neutralization reactions are a special type of double displacement reaction
that produces water. Neutralization involves the reaction of an acid with a base to form water and an ionic compound. You will learn more aboutneutralization reactions in Chapter 10. For example, the neutralization ofhydrogen nitrate (nitric acid) with sodium hydroxide (a base) is a doubledisplacement reaction.
HNO
3(aq)+NaOH (aq)→NaNO 3(aq)+H2O(/lscript)
Often neutralization reactions produce no precipitate or gas. In Chapter 10,
you will learn how chemists recognize when neutralization reactions take place.
You have learned about a variety of double displacement reactions.
In Investigation 4-B, you will make predictions about whether double displacement reactions will take place. Then you will make observationsto test your predictions.
In Investigation 4-C, you will perform reactions that involve copper
compounds to reinforce what you have learned about the different typesof reactions. You will identify the series of reactions that begin by reactingcopper and ﬁnish by producing copper.  To non-chemists, the term
“salt” refers solely to sodiumchloride. To chemists, “salt” isa generic term that describesan ionic compound with ananion that is not OH

H+. Sodium chloride, NaCl, and
potassium ﬂuoride, KF, are two examples.FACTCHEM

Displacement Reactions
A double displacement reaction involves
the exchange of cations between two ionic compounds, usually in aqueous solution. It canbe represented with the general equation
AB+CD→AD+CB
Most often, double displacement reactions result
in the formation of a precipitate. However, somedouble displacement reactions result in the formation of an unstable compound which then decomposes to water and a gas.
The reaction of an acid and a base —a
neutralization reaction —is also a type of double
displacement reaction. It results in the formationof a salt and water.

How can you tell if a double displacement reaction has occurred? How can you predict theproducts of a double displacement reaction?
Prediction
For each reaction in Tables A and B, write a balanced chemical equation. Use the followingguidelines to predict precipitate formation inTable A.•Hydrogen, ammonium, and Group I ions form
soluble compounds with all negative ions.
•Chloride ions form compounds that are not
very soluble when they bond to silver, lead(II),mercury(I), and copper(I) positive ions.
•All compounds that are formed from a nitrate

•With the exception of the ions in the ﬁrst
bulleted point, as well as strontium, barium,radium, and thallium positive ions, hydroxideions form compounds that do not dissolve.
•Iodide ions that are combined with silver,
lead(II), mercury(I), and copper(I) are not very soluble.

You have seen some chemical reactions that involve the formation and
decomposition of different compounds. These reactions involve therearrangement of atoms due to the breaking and formation of chemicalbonds. Chemical bonds involve the interactions between the electrons ofvarious atoms. There is another class of reactions, however, that are notchemical . These reactions involve changes that occur within the nucleus
of atoms. These reactions are called nuclear reactions .
We know that nuclear weapons are capable of mass destruction, yet
radiation therapy, shown in Figure 4.18, is a proven cancer ﬁghter. Smoke
detectors, required by law in all homes, rely on the radioactive decay ofamericium-241. The human body itself is radioactive, due to the presenceof radioactive isotopes including carbon-14, phosphorus-32, and potassi-um-40. Most people view radioactivity and nuclear reactions with a mixture of fascination, awe, and fear. Since radioactivity is all around us,it is important to understand what it is, how it arises, and how we candeal with it safely.
Types of Radioactive Decay and Balancing Nuclear Equations
There are three main types of radioactive decay: alpha particle emission,beta particle emission, and the emission of gamma radiation. When anunstable isotope undergoes radioactive decay, it produces one or more dif-ferent isotopes. We represent radioactive decay using a nuclear equation.
Two rules for balancing nuclear equations are given below.
Alpha Decay
Alpha ( α) particle emission , or alpha decay, involves the loss of one alpha
particle. An α particle is a helium nucleus, 4
2He, composed of two protons
and two neutrons. Since it has no electrons, an alpha particle carries acharge of +2.
One example of alpha particle emission is the decay of radium. This
decay is shown in the following equation:
226
88Ra→222
86Rn+4
2He
Notice that the sum of the mass numbers on the right ( 222+4) equals
the mass on the left (226). As well, the atomic numbers balance(88=86+2). Thus, this nuclear equation is balanced.Rules for Balancing Nuclear Equations
1.The sum of the mass numbers (written as superscripts) on each
side of the equation must balance.
2.The sum of the atomic numbers (written as subscripts) on eachside of the equation must balance.Simple Nuclear Reactions

The total of the atomic masses on the right side is (248+4)=252.
The total of the atomic numbers on the right is (97+2)=99. Therefore,
a=252and b=99. From the periodic table, you see that element number
99 is Es, einsteinium. The missing atom is

0
0γ, or simply γ.
For example, cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope that is found in nuclearfall-out. It decays with the emission of a beta particle and gamma radiation, according to the equation
137
55Cs→137
56Ba+0
−1e+0
0γ
How is gamma radiation produced in a radioactive decay? When a
radioactive nucleus emits an alpha or beta particle, the nucleus is oftenleft in an unstable, high-energy state. The “relaxation ” of the nucleus to
a more stable state is accompanied by the emission of gamma radiation.
Nuclear Fission and Fusion
All cases of radioactive decay involve the atom ’s nucleus. Since these
processes do not involve the atom ’s electrons, they occur regardless of the
chemical environment of the nucleus. For example, radioactive hydrogen-3, or tritium, will decay by βparticle emission whether it is contained in
a water molecule or hydrogen gas, or in a complex protein. Canadians in Chemistry
Harriet Brooks
It was the Nobel that just missed being Canadian.
In 1907, Ernest Rutherford left Montr éal’s McGill
University for a position in England. The followingyear, he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry forhis investigations of the chemistry of radioactivesubstances. Most of the work, however, had beendone in Montr éal. Moreover, one young Canadian
woman had played an important role in putting iton the right track. Harriet Brooks is nearly forgotten today, even
though she helped to show that elements couldbe transformed. For over a century, chemists hadrejected the dream of the ancient alchemists whothought that they might turn lead into gold with thehelp of the philosopher's stone. They believed thatelements were forever ﬁxed and unchangeable.
Then Harriet Brooks arrived on the scene.
When she joined Rutherford ’s team, she was
asked to measure the atomic mass of the isotopesthat make up the mysterious vapour given off byradium. She determined that its atomic mass wasbetween 40 and 100, whereas radium was knownto have an atomic mass of over 140. Surely thiswas not just a gaseous form of radium. Somehowradium was turning into another element!
It turned out that Brooks ’ result was a mis-
take. Radon —as the mystery gas is now known —
has almost the same atomic mass as radium.Brooks ’ result was a fruitful mistake, however.
Her experiment led to a basic understanding ofradioactivity and isotopes.
Why did Rutherford win a Nobel Prize for
Chemistry? Both he and Brooks worked as physicists. By proving that elements transformed,Rutherford, Brooks, and their co-workers revolu-tionized traditional chemistry.
146 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingA summary of alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma emission
Many chemical reactions, once begun, can be stopped. For example,
a combustion reaction, such as a ﬁre, can be extinguished before it burns
itself out. Nuclear decay processes, on the other hand, cannot be stopped.
The principles of balancing nuclear equations apply to all nuclear
reactions. Nuclear ﬁssion occurs when a highly unstable isotope splits
into smaller particles. Nuclear ﬁssion usually has to be induced in a
particle accelerator. Here, an atom can absorb a stream of high-energy particles such as neutrons,
1
0n. This will cause the atom to split into
smaller fragments.
For example, when uranium-235 absorbs a high energy neutron, 1
0n, it
breaks up, or undergoes ﬁssion as follows:
235
92U+1
0n→87
35Br++ 31
0n
How would you identify the missing particle? Notice that three neutrons,
1
0n, have a mass number of 3 and a total atomic number of 0. The total
atomic mass on the left side is (235+1)=236. On the right we have
(87+3(1))=90, and so (236−90)=146remains. The missing particle
must have a mass number of 146.
The total atomic number on the left is 92. The total atomic number
on the right, not including the missing particle, is 35. This means that
(92−35)=57is the atomic number of the missing particle. From the
periodic table, atomic number 57 corresponds to La, lanthanum. The balanced nuclear equation is

Check your answer by noting that the total mass number and the total
atomic number are the same on both sides. Figure 4.20

Nuclear reactors have complex cooling systems that absorb the
heat given off by the ﬁssion reaction. The absorbed heat is used to
produce steam to drive a generator, thus producing electrical energy.Cooling the steam for re-use requires a large amount of cool water,which is usually obtained from a nearby river or lake. A large amountof hot water is then released into the river or lake. Do you think this isa form of pollution? What kinds of problems might warm water cause?
Alpha or beta particle emission from a radioactive nucleus is
often, but not always, accompanied by gamma rays. Why does the presence of gamma rays notaffect how a nuclear equation of this type
is balanced?
Write a balanced nuclear equation to describe each of the
following statements. Classify the reactions.

UNIT 1 Project
152 MHR • Unit 1  Matter and Chemical BondingDeveloping a
Chemistry NewsletterBackground
Many of the chemicals in your school laboratory are
hazardous. Some are corrosive, some are ﬂammable,and some are poisonous. Many exhibit these proper-ties when they are combined. You can work safelywith these chemicals, as long as you treat them withcare and respect, observe proper safety precautions,and follow the directions that are given by yourteacher and this textbook.
Did you know that many of the chemical products
in your home are hazardous, too? For example, com-mon household bleach, when used as directed, is safefor disinfecting and whitening clothing. Hazard labelson bleaching products, however, warn against mixingbleach with acids, household ammonia, or productsthat contain these chemicals. Bleach, when combinedwith acids, produces toxic chlorine gas. The productsof combining bleach with ammonia are explosive.
Most homes contain numerous chemical products,
ranging from cleaners and disinfectants, to fertilizersand fuels. All potentially hazardous products have awarning on their containers or on paper inserts intheir packaging. Many, but not all, have a list of thechemicals they contain. Some hazardous productsadvise users only to keep them away from childrenand pets.
How much do you know about the safe use of
chemical products? Would you know what to do if anaccidental spill occurred? Would the members of yourfamily, or people in your community, know what to do?
Challenge
Design, produce, and distribute a newsletter to inform your community about the safe use of commonchemical products. Include the potential hazards ofthese products to living things and the environment.Also include emergency procedures to follow if anaccident occurred.
Materials
Select a medium for your newsletter, such as a traditional paper newsletter or an electronic versionfor the Internet. For a traditional newsletter, you will need to decide on methods of production and distribution. For an electronic version, you will needto use computer hardware and software.
Unit 1 Project • MHR 153Design Criteria
As a class, develop a rubic listing criteria for
assessing the newsletters. For example, one criterion may involve a newsletter’s effectiveness inaltering the behaviour of its readers. You may wantto develop different criteria for traditional and elec-tronic newsletters. Your newsletter must be factual, easy to read for awide variety of audiences, and educational.
Action Plan
The following items must be part of your newsletter:
• examples of household chemical products and
their uses
• hazards associated with each chemical product• suggestions to encourage safe and responsible use• environmental considerations for the disposal of
the chemical products
• alternative products (if any), and hazards
(if any) associated with these alternatives
• an interview with a professional who
researches, develops, or works with household chemical products

Arecipe for chocolate chip mufﬁns tells you exactly what ingredients
you will need. One recipe might call for ﬂour, butter, eggs, milk, vinegar,baking soda, sugar, and chocolate chips. It also tells you how much ofeach ingredient you will need, using convenient units of measurement.Which of the ingredients do you measure by counting? Which do youmeasure by volume or by mass? The recipe does not tell you exactly howmany chocolate chips or grains of sugar you will need. It would take fartoo long to count individual chocolate chips or grains of sugar. Instead, theamounts are given in millilitres or grams—the units of volume or mass.
In some ways, chemistry is similar to baking. To carry out a reaction
successfully—in chemistry or in baking—you need to know how much of each reactant you will need. When you bake something with vinegarand baking soda, for example, the baking soda reacts with acetic acid inthe vinegar to produce carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas helpsthe batter rise. The chemical equation for this reaction is
NaHCO
3(s)+CH3COOH (aq)→NaCH 3COO (aq)+H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)
According to the balanced equation, one molecule of baking soda
reacts with one molecule of acetic acid to form a salt, water, and carbondioxide. If you wanted to carry out the reaction, how would you know theamount of baking soda and vinegar to use? Their molecules are much toosmall and numerous to be counted like eggs.
In this chapter, you will learn how chemists count atoms by organiz-
ing large numbers of them into convenient, measurable groups. You willlearn how these groups relate the number of atoms in a substance to itsmass. Using your calculator and the periodic table, you will learn how to convert between the mass of a substance and the number of atoms it contains.5.1 Isotopes and Average

Specific Expectations  Isotopes and
Average Atomic Mass
How does the mass of a substance relate to the number of atoms in
the substance? To answer this question, you need to understand how therelative masses of individual atoms relate to the masses of substances thatyou can measure on a balance.
The head of a pin, like the one shown in Figure 5.1, is made primarily
of iron. It has a mass of about 8×10
−3g, yet it contains about 8×1019
atoms. Even if you could measure the mass of a single atom on a balance,
the mass would be so tiny (about 1×10−22gfor an iron atom) that it
would be impractical to use in everyday situations. Therefore, you need toconsider atoms in bulk, not individually.
How do you relate the mass of individual atoms to the mass of a large,
easily measurable number of atoms? In the next two sections, you willﬁnd out.
The head of a typical pin contains about 80 quintillion atoms.
Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses
In Chapter 2, you learned that the mass of an atom is expressed in atomic mass units. Atomic mass units are a relative measure, deﬁned bythe mass of carbon-12. According to this deﬁnition, one atom of carbon-12is assigned a mass of 12 u. Stated another way, 1u=
1
12of the mass of
one atom of carbon-12.
The masses of all other atoms are deﬁned by their relationship to
carbon-12. For example, oxygen-16 has a mass that is 133% of the mass of carbon-12. Hence the mass of an atom of oxygen-16 is
133
100×12.000 u =16.0 u .Figure 5.1
Chapter 5  Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole • MHR 163Usually, not all the atoms in an element have the same mass. As you
learned in Chapter 2, atoms of the same element that contain differentnumbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up oftwo or more isotopes. Chemists need to account for the presence of iso-topes when ﬁnding the relationship between the mass of a large numberof atoms and the mass of a single atom. To understand why this is impor-tant, consider the following analogy.
Imagine that you have the task of ﬁnding the total mass of 10 000
spoons. If you know the mass of a dessertspoon, can you assume that itsmass represents the average mass of all the spoons? What if the 10 000spoons include soupspoons, dessertspoons, and tablespoons? If you usethe mass of a dessertspoon to calculate the total mass of all the spoons,you may obtain a reasonable estimate. Your answer will not be accurate,however, because each type of spoon has a different mass. You cannot calculate an accurate average mass for all the spoons based on knowingthe mass of only one type. How can you improve the accuracy of youranswer without determining the mass of all the spoons?
Think about ﬁnding the average mass of a group of objects that have
different masses. How is this similar to ﬁnding the average mass of an element that iscomposed of different isotopes?
Isotopic Abundance
Chemists face a situation similar to the one described above. Because all
the atoms in a given element do not have the same number of neutrons,they do not all have the same mass. For example, magnesium has threenaturally occurring isotopes. It is made up of 79% magnesium-24, 10% magnesium-25, and 11% magnesium-26. Whether the magnesium is found in a supplement tablet (like the ones on the right) or in seawateras Mg(OH)
2, it is always made up of these three isotopes in the same
proportion. The relative amount in which each isotope is present in anelement is called the isotopic abundance . It can be expressed as a percent
or as a decimal fraction. When chemists consider the mass of a samplecontaining billions of atoms, they must take the isotopic abundance into account.Figure 5.2
Mg-24 Mg-25 Mg-26
Magnesium plays a variety of
roles in the body. It is involvedin energy production, nervefunction, and muscle relax-ation, to name just a few. The magnesium in thesetablets, like all naturally occurring magnesium, is made up of three isotopes.
FACTCHEM
164 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesAverage Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table
The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses
of all the element’s isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of eachisotope within the element. The average atomic mass is the mass that isgiven for each element in the periodic table.
It is important to interpret averages carefully. For example, in 1996,
the average size of a Canadian family was 3.1. Of course, no one familyactually has 3.1 people. In the same way, while the average atomic massof carbon is 12.01 u, no one atom of carbon has a mass of 12.01 u.
Examine Figure 5.3. Since the atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12,
why does the periodic table show a value of 12.01 u, instead of exactly 12 u? Carbon is made up of several isotopes, not just carbon-12. Naturallyoccurring carbon contains carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. If allthese isotopes were present in equal amounts, you could simply ﬁnd the average of the masses of the isotopes. This average mass would beabout 13 u, since the masses of carbon-13 and carbon-14 are about 13 uand 14 u respectively.
The isotopes, though, are not present in equal amounts. Carbon-12
comprises 98.9% of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for 1.1%.Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount—about 1×10
−10%. It makes
sense that the average mass of all the isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u—veryclose to 12—since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.
The atomic mass that is given in the periodic table represents the average
mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element. It takes into account theirisotopic abundances.
Thus chemists need to know an element’s isotopic abundance and the
mass of each isotope to calculate the average atomic mass. How dochemists determine the isotopic abundance associated with each element?How do they ﬁnd the mass of each isotope? They use a mass
spectrometer , a powerful instrument that generates a magnetic ﬁeld to
obtain data about the mass and abundance of atoms and molecules. Youwill learn more about the mass spectrometer in Tools & Techniques onpage 166. You can use the data obtained with a mass spectrometer to calculate the average atomic mass given in the periodic table.Figure 5.3

Chapter 5  Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole • MHR 165Working with Weighted Averages
If you obtain the isotopic abundance of an element from mass spectrome-
ter data or a table, you can calculate the average atomic mass of the ele-ment. You do this by calculating the weighted average of each isotope’s
mass. A weighted average takes into account not only the values associat-ed with a set of data, but also the abundance or importance of each value.
Normally, when you calculate the average of a set of data, you ﬁnd the
equally weighted average. You add the given values and divide the totalby the number of values in the set. Each value in the average is givenequal weight. For example, imagine that you have three objects: A, B, andC. A has a mass of 1.0 kg, B has a mass of 2.0 kg, and C has a mass of 3.0kg. Their average mass is
Mass of (A + B + C)
Number of items=1.0 kg+2.0 kg+3.0 kg
3
=2.0 kg
What if you have a set containing two of A, one of B, and three of C?
Their average mass becomes
2(1.0 kg) +2.0 kg+3(3.0 kg)
6=2.2 kg
This is a weighted average.
Another way to calculate the same weighted average is to consider
the relative abundance of each object. There are six objects in total. A ispresent as
2
6(33%) of the total, B is present as 1
6(17%) of the total, and C
is present as 3
6(50%) of the total. Thus their average mass can be calculat-
ed in the following way:
(0.33)(1.0 kg) +(0.17)(2.0 kg) +(0.50)(3.0 kg) =2.2 kg
Calculating Average Atomic Mass
You can use a similar method to calculate average atomic mass. If you
know the atomic mass of each isotope that makes up an element, as wellas the isotopic abundance of each isotope, you can calculate the averageatomic mass of the element.
For example, lithium exists as two isotopes: lithium-7 and lithium-6.
As you can see in Figure 5.4, lithium-7 has a mass of 7.015 u and makesup 92.58% of lithium. Lithium-6 has a mass of 6.015 u and makes up the remaining 7.42%. To calculate the average atomic mass of lithium,multiply the mass of each isotope by its abundance.

(7.015 u) +/parenleftBig7.42

Looking at the periodic table conﬁrms that the aver-
age atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 u. The upcomingSample Problem gives another example of how to calculate average atomic mass.

The Mass Spectrometer
Many chemists depend on instruments known
as mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometers candetect trace pollutants in the atmosphere, provideinformation about the composition of large mole-cules, and help to determine the age of Earth ’s
oldest rocks.
As well, mass spectrometers can ﬁnd the
relative abundance of each isotope in an element.In 1912, J.J. Thompson ﬁrst detected neon-20
and neon-22 in a sample of neon gas by using amagnetic ﬁeld to separate the isotopes.
Today ’s mass spectrometers also use a mag-
netic ﬁeld to separate the isotopes of an element.
Since a magnetic ﬁeld can only affect the path of
a charged particle, the atoms must ﬁrst be
charged, or “ionized. ” The magnetic ﬁeld then
deﬂects ions with the same charge, but different
masses, onto separate paths. Imagine rolling atennis ball at a right angle to the air current froma fan. The air current de ﬂects the path of the ball.
The same air current de ﬂects a Ping-Pong ™ ball
more than a tennis ball. Similarly, a magneticﬁeld de ﬂects isotopes of smaller mass more than
isotopes of larger mass. In a mass spectrometer, elements that are not
gases are vaporized by heating. Next, the gasatoms are ionized. In electron impact ionization,the gas atoms are bombarded with a stream ofelectrons from a heated ﬁlament. These electrons
collide with the gas atoms, causing each atom tolose an electron and become a positive ion.
The ions are focussed and accelerated by elec-
tric ﬁelds, toward a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic
ﬁeld de ﬂects them and forces them to take a
curved path. Lighter ions curve more than heavierions. Therefore ions from different isotopes arriveat different destinations. Since ions have a charge,a detector can be used to register the current ateach destination. The current is proportional tothe number of ions that arrive at the destination.An isotope that has a larger relative abundancegenerates a larger current. From the currents atthe different destinations, chemists can deducethe proportion of each isotope in the element.

168 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesThe mass of a Canadian penny has decreased
several times over the years. Therefore you canuse pennies to represent different “isotopes ” of a
ﬁctitious element, centium . That is, each “atom ”
of centium reacts the same way —it is still worth
1¢—but the various isotopes have different
characteristic masses.
Safety Precautions
Procedure
1.Obtain a bag of pennies from your teacher.
Since the mass of a penny decreased in 1982and 1997, your bag will contain pennies datedanywhere from 1982 to the present date. 2.Sort your pennies into groups of pre-1997 “isotopes ” and post-1997 “isotopes ” of
centium .
3.Count the number of pennies in each group.
4.Find the mass of ten pennies from each group.
Divide the total mass by 10 to get the mass ofeach centium “isotope. ”
5.Use the data you have just gathered to calcu-
late the mass of the pennies, using a weightedaverage. This represents the “average atomic
mass ” of centium .
Analysis
1.In step 4, you used the average mass of
ten pennies to represent the mass of one “isotope ” of centium .

not just ﬁnd the mass of one penny from
each group?
(b)If you were able to ﬁnd the mass of real
isotopes for this experiment, would youneed to do step 4? Explain.
2.Compare your “average atomic mass ” for
centium with the “average atomic mass ”
obtained by other groups.
(a)Are all the masses the same? Explain anydifferences.
(b)What if you were able to use real isotopesof an element, such as copper, for thisexperiment? Would you expect results to beconsistent throughout the class? Explain.

What Is Given?
Atomic mass of 10
5B=10.01 u
Atomic mass of 11
5B=11.01 u
From the periodic table, the average atomic mass of boron
is B=10.81 u .
Plan Your Strategy
Express the abundance of each isotope as a decimal rather than a
percent. The total abundance of both isotopes is therefore 1. Let theabundance of boron-10 be x. Let the abundance of boron-11 be 1−x.
Set up an equation, and solve for x.
Act on Your Strategy
Average atomic mass =x(atomic mass B-10) +(1−x)(atomic mass B-11)
10.81=x(10.01)+(1−x)(11.01)
10.81=10.01 x+11.01−11.01 x
11.01 x−10.01 x=11.01−10.81
x=0.2000
The abundance of boron-10 is 0.2000.
The abundance of boron-11 is 1−x, or 1−0.2000=0.8000 .
The abundance of 10
5Bis therefore 20.00%. The abundance
of 11
5Bis 80.00%.
Check Your Solution
The fact that boron-11 comprises 80% of naturally occurring boron
makes sense, because the average atomic mass of boron is 10.81 u.This is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.Sample Problem

Specific Expectations  In section 5.1, you learned how to use isotopic abundances and isotopic
masses to ﬁnd the average atomic mass of an element. You can use the
average atomic mass, found in the periodic table, to describe the averagemass of an atom in a large sample.
Why is relating average atomic mass to the mass of large samples
important? In a laboratory, as in everyday life, we deal with macroscopic samples. These samples contain incredibly large numbers of atoms ormolecules. Can you imagine a cookie recipe calling for six septillion molecules of baking soda? What if copper wire in a hardware store werepriced by the atom instead of by the metre, as in Figure 5.5? What if wepaid our water bill according to the number of water molecules that weused? The numbers involved would be ridiculously inconvenient. In thissection, you will learn how chemists group large numbers of atoms intoamounts that are easily measurable.
Grouping for Convenience
In a chemistry lab, as well as in other contexts, it is important to be ableto measure amounts accurately and conveniently. When you purchaseheadache tablets from a drugstore, you are con ﬁdent that each tablet
contains the correct amount of the active ingredient. Years of testing anddevelopment have determined the optimum amount of the active ingredi-ent that you should ingest. If there is too little of the active ingredient, thetablet may not be effective. If there is too much, the tablet may be harm-ful. When the tablets are manufactured, the active ingredient needs to beweighed in bulk. When the tablets are tested, however, to ensure that theycontain the right amount of the active ingredient, chemists need to knowhow many molecules of the substance are present. How do chemistsgroup particles so that they know how many are present in a given massof substance?
On its own, the mass of a chemical is not very useful to a chemist.
The chemical reactions that take place depend on the number of atomspresent, not on their masses. Since atoms are far too small and numerousto count, you need a way to relate the numbers of atoms to masses thatcan be measured.
Copper wire is often
priced by the metre because themetre is a convenient unit. Whatunit do chemists use to work withlarge numbers of atoms?Figure 5.5
172 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesWhen many items in a large set need to be counted, it is often useful
to work with groups of items rather than individual items. When you hearthe word “dozen, ” you think of the number 12. It does not matter what
the items are. A dozen refers to the quantity 12 whether the items are eggsor pencils or baseballs. Table 5.1 lists some common quantities that weuse to deal with everyday items.
Table 5.1 Some Common Quantities
You do not buy eggs one at a time. You purchase them in units of a dozen.
Similarly, your school does not order photocopy paper by the sheet. Thepaper is purchased in bundles of 500 sheets, called a ream. It would beimpractical to sell sheets of paper individually.
The De ﬁnition of the Mole
Convenient, or easily measurable, amounts of elements contain huge num-
bers of atoms. Therefore chemists use a quantity that is much larger than adozen or a ream to group atoms and molecules together. This quantity isthe mole (symbol mol).
•One mole (1 mol) of a substance contains 6.022 141 99 ×10
23particles
of the substance. This value is called the Avogadro constant . Its symbol
is NA.
•The mole is de ﬁned as the amount of substance that contains as many
elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or formula units) as exactly 12 gof carbon-12.

Chapter 5  Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole • MHR 173For example, one mole of carbon contains 6.02×1023atoms of C. One
mole of sodium chloride contains 6.02×1023formula units of NaCl.
One mole of hydro ﬂuoric acid contains 6.02×1023molecules of HF.
The Avogadro constant is an experimentally determined quantity.
Chemists continually devise more accurate methods to determine howmany atoms are in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. This means that the acceptedvalue has changed slightly over the years since it was ﬁrst de ﬁned.
The Chemist ’s Dozen
The mole is literally the chemist ’s dozen. Just as egg farmers and grocers
use the dozen (a unit of 12) to count eggs, chemists use the mole (a muchlarger number) to count atoms, molecules, or formula units. When farmersthink of two dozen eggs, they are also thinking of 24 eggs.
(2 dozen) ×/parenleftBig12 eggs

=24 eggs
Chemists work in a similar way. As you have learned above, 1 mol
has 6.02×1023particles. Thus 2 mol of aluminum atoms contain
12.0×1023atoms of Al.
2 mol×(6.02×1023atoms
mol)=1.20×1024atoms of Al
How Big Is the Avogadro Constant?
The Avogadro constant is a huge number. Its magnitude becomes easier
to visualize if you imagine it in terms of ordinary items. For example,suppose that you created a stack of 6.02×10
23loonies, as in Figure 5.7.
To determine the height of the stack, you could determine the height ofone loonie and multiply by 6.02×10

be this huge to group single atoms into convenient amounts. What does 1 mol of a substance look like? Figure 5.8 shows some samples of elements.Each sample contains 6.02×10

different mass. You will learn why in section 5.3. Examine the followingSample Problem to see how to work with the Avogadro constant.

What Is Given?
Each round trip is 2×5046 km or 10 092 km. A pea has a diameter

Specific Expectations  Molar Mass
In section 5.2, you explored the relationship between the number of atoms
or particles and the number of moles in a sample. Now you are ready torelate the number of moles to the mass, in grams. Then you will be able todetermine the number of atoms, molecules, or formula units in a sampleby ﬁnding the mass of the sample.
Mass and the Mole
You would never express the mass of a lump of gold, like the one in
Figure 5.11, in atomic mass units. You would express its mass in grams.How does the mole relate the number of atoms to measurable quantities of a substance? The de ﬁnition of the mole pertains to relative atomic
mass, as you learned in section 5.1. One atom of carbon-12 has a mass ofexactly 12 u. Also, by de ﬁnition, one mole of carbon-12 atoms ( 6.02×10
23
carbon-12 atoms) has a mass of exactly 12 g.
The Avogadro constant is the factor that converts the relative mass of
individual atoms or molecules, expressed in atomic mass units, to molequantities, expressed in grams.
How can you use this relationship to relate mass and moles? The
periodic table tells us the average mass of a single atom in atomic massunits (u). For example, zinc has an average atomic mass of 65.39 u. One
mole of an element has a mass expressed in grams numerically equivalentto the element’s average atomic mass expressed in atomic mass units . One
mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g. This relationship allowschemists to use a balance to count atoms. You can use the periodic tableto determine the mass of one mole of an element.
What is Molar Mass?
The mass of one mole of any element, expressed in grams, is numericallyequivalent to the average atomic mass of the element, expressed in atomicmass units. The mass of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass
(symbol M). Molar mass is expressed in g/mol. For example, the average
atomic mass of gold, as given in the periodic table, is 196.97 u. Thus themass of one mole of gold atoms, gold ’s molar mass, is 196.97 g. Table 5.2
gives some additional examples of molar masses.

Chapter 5  Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole • MHR 181Finding the Molar Mass of Compounds
While you can ﬁnd the molar mass of an element just by looking at the
periodic table, you need to do some calculations to ﬁnd the molar mass
of a compound. For example, 1 mol of beryllium oxide, BeO, contains 1 mol of beryllium and 1 mol of oxygen. To ﬁnd the molar mass of BeO,
add the mass of each element that it contains.
M
BeO=9.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol
=25.01 g/mol
Examine the following Sample Problem to learn how to determine the
molar mass of a compound. Following Investigation 5-A on the next page,there are some Practice Problems for you to try.
Problem
What is the mass of one mole of calcium phosphate, Ca3(PO 4)2?
What Is Required?
You need to ﬁnd the molar mass of calcium phosphate.
What Is Given?
You know the formula of calcium phosphate. You also know, from
the periodic table, the average atomic mass of each atom that makesup calcium phosphate.
Plan Your Strategy
Find the total mass of each element to determine the molar mass of calcium phosphate. Find the mass of 3 mol of calcium, the massof 2 mol of phosphorus, and the mass of 8 mol of oxygen. Then addthese masses together.
Act on Your Strategy
MCa×3=(40.08 g/mol) ×3=120.24 g/mol
MP×2=(30.97 g/mol) ×2=61.94 g/mol
MO×8=(16.00 g/mol) ×8=128.00 g/mol
MCa3(PO 4)2=120.24 g/mol +61.94 g/mol +128.00 g/mol
=310.18 g/mol
Therefore the molar mass of calcium phosphate is 310.18 g/mol .

Using round numbers for a quick check, you get
(40×3)+(30×2)+(15×8)=300
This estimate is close to the answer of 310.18 g/mol .Sample Problem

Converting from Mass to Moles
In the previous Sample Problem, you saw how to convert moles to mass.
Often, however, chemists know the mass of a substance but are moreinterested in knowing the number of moles. Suppose that a reaction produces 223 g of iron and 204 g of aluminum oxide. The masses of the substances do not tell you very much about the reaction. You know,however, that 223 g of iron is 4 mol of iron. You also know that 204 g ofaluminum oxide is 2 mol of aluminum oxide. You may conclude that the reaction produces twice as many moles of iron as it does moles of aluminum oxide. You can perform the reaction many times to test yourconclusion. If your conclusion is correct, the mole relationship betweenthe products will hold. To calculate the number of moles in a sample, ﬁnd

Chemical Amounts in Vitamin Supplements
Vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) help
to regulate your metabolism. They are thebuilding blocks of blood and bone, and theymaintain muscles and nerves. In Canada, astandard called Recommended Nutrient Intake
(RNI) outlines the amounts of micronutrients
that people should ingest each day. Eating abalanced diet is the best way to achieve yourRNI. Sometimes, however, you may need totake multivitamin supplements when you areunable to attain your RNI through diet alone.
The label on a bottle of supplements lists
all the vitamins and minerals the supplementscontain. It also lists the form and source ofeach vitamin and mineral, and the amount of each. The form of a mineral is especiallyimportant to know because it affects the quantity your body can use. For example, asupplement may claim to contain 650 mg ofcalcium carbonate, CaCO
3, per tablet. This
does not mean that there is 650 mg of calcium.The amount of actual calcium, or elemental
calcium , in calcium carbonate is only 260 mg.
Calcium carbonate has more elemental calciumthan the same amount of calcium gluconate,which only has 58 mg for every 650 mg of thecompound. Calcium gluconate may be easierfor your body to absorb, however.
Quality Control
Multivitamin manufacturers employ chemists,or analysts, to ensure that the products theymake have the right balance of micronutrients.Manufacturers have departments devoted to quality control (QC). QC chemists analyze
all the raw materials in the supplements, usingstandardized tests. Most manufacturers usetests approved by a “standardization body, ”
such as the US Pharmacopoeia. Such standard-ization bodies have developed testing guide-lines to help manufacturers ensure that theirproducts contain what the labels claim, withinstrict limits.
To test for quality, QC chemists prepare
samples of the raw materials from which theywill make the supplements. They label the
samples according to the “lot” of materials
from which the samples were taken. They pow-der and weigh the samples. Then they extractthe vitamins. At the same time, they preparestandard solutions containing a known amountof each vitamin.
Next the chemists compare the samples to
the standards by subjecting both to the sametests. One test that is used is high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC ). HPLC produces
a spectrum, or “ﬁngerprint, ” that identi ﬁes
each compound. Analysts compare the spectrum that is produced by the samples tothe spectrum that is produced by the standard.
Analysts test tablets and capsules for
dissolution and disintegration properties. Theanalyst may use solutions that simulate thecontents of the human stomach or intestinesfor these tests. Only when the analysts are surethat the tablets pass all the necessary require-ments are the tablets shipped to retail stores.
Making Connections
1.Why might consuming more of the dailyRNI of a vitamin or mineral be harmful?

would a 16-year-old female have to take tomeet her daily RNI?
An analyst tests whether tablets will
sufﬁciently dissolve within a given time limit.

Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 197Chemical Proportions
in Compounds
How do chemists use what they know about molar masses? In Chapter 5,
you learned how to use the periodic table and the mole to relate the massof a compound to the number of particles in the compound. Chemists canuse their understanding of molar mass to ﬁnd out important informationabout compounds.
Sometimes chemists analyze a compound that is found in nature to
learn how to produce it more cheaply in a laboratory. For example, con-sider the ﬂavour used in vanilla ice cream, which may come from naturalor artiﬁcial vanilla extract. Natural vanilla extract is made from vanillaseed pods, shown on the left. The seed pods must be harvested andprocessed before being sold as vanilla extract. The scent and ﬂavour ofsynthetic vanilla come from a compound called vanillin, which can beproduced chemically in bulk. Therefore its production is much cheaper.Similarly, many medicinal chemicals that are found in nature can be produced more cheaply and efﬁciently in a laboratory.
Suppose that you want to synthesize a compound such as vanillin
in a laboratory. You must ﬁrst determine the elements in the compound.Then you need to know the proportion of each element that is present.This information, along with your understanding of molar mass, will helpyou determine the chemical formula of the compound. Once you knowthe chemical formula, you are on your way to ﬁnding out how to producethe compound.
In this chapter, you will learn about the relationships between chemi-
cal formulas, molar masses, and the masses of elements in compounds.6.1 Percentage Composition

Specific Expectations  Percentage Composition
When you calculate and use the molar mass of a compound, such as
water, you are making an important assumption. You are assuming thatevery sample of water contains hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of twohydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom. Thus you are also assuming that themasses of hydrogen and oxygen in pure water always exist in a ratio of 2 g:16 g. This may seem obvious to you, because you know that themolecular formula of water is always H
2O, regardless of whether it comes
from any of the sources shown in Figure 6.1. When scientists ﬁrst discov-ered that compounds contained elements in ﬁxed mass proportions, theydid not have the periodic table. In fact, the discovery of ﬁxed mass pro-portions was an important step toward the development of atomic theory.
The Law of Deﬁnite Proportions
In the late eighteenth century, Joseph Louis Proust, a French chemist, analyzed many samples of copper(II) carbonate, CuCO
3. He found
that the samples contained the same proportion of copper, carbon, andoxygen, regardless of the source of the copper(II) carbonate. This discov-ery led Proust to propose the law of deﬁnite proportions : the elements
in a chemical compound are always present in the same proportions by mass .
If a bicycle factory has 1000
wheels and 400 frames, howmany bicycles can be made?How many wheels does eachbicycle have? Is the number of wheels per bicycle affectedby any extra wheels that thefactory may have in stock?Relate these questions to thelaw of deﬁnite proportions.
Suppose that you
distil pure water from each ofthese sources to purify it. Are the distilled water samples thesame or different? What is themolar mass of the distilled waterfrom each source?Figure 6.1
Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 199The mass of an element in a compound, expressed as a percent of the total
mass of the compound, is the element’s mass percent. The mass percent
of hydrogen in water from any of the sources shown in Figure 6.1 is11.2%. Similarly, the mass percent of oxygen in water is always 88.8%.Whether the water sample is distilled from a lake, an ice ﬂoe, or a drink-ing fountain, the hydrogen and oxygen in pure water are always presentin these proportions.
Different Compounds from the Same Elements
The law of deﬁnite proportions does not imply that elements in com-pounds are always present in the same relative amounts. It is possible tohave different compounds made up of different amounts of the same ele-ments. For example, water, H
2O, and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, are both
made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Yet, as you can see in Figure 6.2, eachcompound has unique properties. Each compound has a different masspercent of oxygen and hydrogen. You may recognize hydrogen peroxide as a household chemical. It is an oxidizing agent that is used to bleachhair and treat minor cuts. It is also sold as an alternative to chlorine bleach.
Figure 6.3 shows a molecule of benzene, C
6H6. Benzene contains
7.76% hydrogen and 92.2% carbon by mass. Octane, C8H18, is a major
component of the fuel used for automobiles. It contains 84.1% carbon and 15.9% hydrogen.
Water contains hydrogen and oxygen, but it does not decompose in the
presence of manganese dioxide. Hydrogen peroxide is also composed of hydrogen and oxygen. It is fairly unstable and decomposes vigorously in the presence of manganese(IV) oxide.
Similarly, carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2, are both
made up of carbon and oxygen. Yet each compound is unique, with itsown physical and chemical properties. Carbon dioxide is a product of cellular respiration and the complete combustion of fossil fuels. Carbonmonoxide is a deadly gas formed when insufﬁcient oxygen is present during the combustion of carbon-containing compounds. Carbon monoxide always contains 42.88% carbon by mass. Carbon dioxidealways contains 27.29% carbon by mass.Figure 6.2
Benzene C6H6, is
made up of six carbon atoms andsix hydrogen atoms. Why doesbenzene not contain 50% of eachelement by mass? Figure 6.3Chemical formulas such as COand CO
2reﬂect an important
law called the law of multiple
proportions . This law applies
when two elements (such ascarbon and oxygen) combineto form two or more differentcompounds. In these cases,the masses of the element(such as O
2in CO and CO2)
that combine with a ﬁxedamount of the second elementare in ratios of small wholenumbers. For example, twomoles of carbon can combinewith one mole of oxygen toform carbon monoxide, or withtwo moles of oxygen to formcarbon dioxide. The ratio of thetwo different amounts of oxygen that combine with theﬁxed amount of carbon is 1:2.FACTCHEM
200 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesPercentage Composition
Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide contain the same elements but have
different proportions of these elements. In other words, they are composeddifferently. Chemists express the composition of compounds in variousways. One way is to describe how many moles of each element make up amole of a compound. For example, one mole of carbon dioxide containsone mole of carbon and two moles of oxygen. Another way is to describethe percent mass of each element in a compound.
The percentage composition of a compound refers to the relative mass
of each element in the compound. In other words, percentage compositionis a statement of the values for mass percent of every element in the com-pound. For example, the compound vanillin, C
8H8O3, has a percentage
composition of 63.1% carbon, 5.3% hydrogen, and 31.6% oxygen, asshown in Figure 6.4.
A compound’s percentage composition is an important piece of
information. For example, percentage composition can be determinedexperimentally, and then used to help identify the compound.

percentage composition. This skill is useful for interpreting experimentaldata when the chemical formula is unknown. Often, however, the percentage composition is calculated from a known chemical formula.This is useful when you are interested in extracting a certain elementfrom a compound. For example, many metals, such as iron and mercury,exist in mineral form. Mercury is most often found in nature asmercury(II) sulﬁde, HgS. Knowing the percentage composition of HgShelps a metallurgist predict the mass of mercury that can be extractedfrom a sample of HgS.
When determining the percentage composition by mass of a
homogeneous sample, the size of the sample does not matter. Accordingto the law of deﬁnite proportions, there is a ﬁxed proportion of each element in the compound, no matter how much of the compound youhave. This means that you can choose a convenient sample size when calculating percentage composition from a formula.
If you assume that you have one mole of a compound, you can use the
molar mass of the compound, with its chemical formula, to calculate itspercentage composition. For example, suppose that you want to ﬁnd theA company manufactures gift boxes that contain
two pillows and one gold brick. The gold brickhas a mass of 20 kg. Each pillow has a mass of 1.0 kg.
Procedure
1.You are a quality control specialist at the giftbox factory. You need to know the followinginformation:
(a)What is the percent of pillows, in terms ofthe number of items, in the gift box?
(b)What is the percent of pillows, by mass, inthe gift box?
(c)What is the percent of gold, by mass, in thegift box?
2.You have a truckload of gift boxes to inspect.You now need to know this information:
(a)What is the percent of pillows, in terms ofthe number of items, in the truckload of giftboxes?
(b)What is the percent of pillows, by mass, inthe truckload of gift boxes?
(c)What is the percent of gold, by mass, in thetruckload of gift boxes?Analysis
1.The truckload of gift boxes, each containing 2 light pillows and 1 heavy gold brick, can beused to represent a pure substance, water,containing 2 mol of a “light ” element, such as
hydrogen, and 1 mol of a “heavy ” element,
such as oxygen.
(a)What is the percent of hydrogen, in termsof the number of atoms, in 1 mol of water?
(b)What is the mass percent of hydrogen in 1 mol of water?
(c)What is the mass percent of oxygen in 1 mol of water?
2.Would the mass percent of hydrogen or oxygen in question 1 change if you had 25 molof water? Explain.
3.Why do you think chemists use mass percentrather than percent by number of atoms?

Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 203percentage composition of HgS. You can assume that you have one mole
of HgS and ﬁnd the mass percents of mercury and sulfur in one mole ofthe compound.
Mass percent of Hg in HgS=Mass of Hg in 1 mol of HgS
Mass of 1 mol of HgS×100%
=200.6 g
228.68 g×100%
=87.7%
Mercury(II) sulﬁde is 87.7% mercury by mass. Since there are only two
elements in HgS, you can subtract the mass percent of mercury from 100 percent to ﬁnd the mass percent of sulfur.
Mass percent of S in HgS=100%−87.7%=12.3%
Therefore, the percentage composition of mercury(II) sulﬁde is
87.7% mercury and 12.3% sulfur.
Sometimes there are more than two elements in a compound, or
more than one atom of each element. This makes determining percentagecomposition more complex than in the example above. Work through the Sample Problem below to learn how to calculate the percentage composition of a compound from its molecular formula.Before AD1500, many
alchemists thought that matter was composed of two “elements”: mercury and sulfur. To impress their patrons,they performed an experimentwith mercury sulﬁde, alsocalled cinnabar, HgS. Theyheated the red cinnabar, whichdrove off the sulfur and left theshiny liquid mercury. On furtherheating, the mercury reactedto form a red compound again.Alchemists wrongly thoughtthat the mercury had beenconverted back to cinnabar.What Hg(II) compound do youthink was really formed whenthe mercury was heated in theair?

In this section, you learned that you can calculate percentage composition
using a chemical formula. Often, however, chemists do not know thechemical formula of the compound they are analyzing, as in Figure 6.5.Through experiment, they can determine the masses of the elements thatmake up the compound. Then they can use the masses to calculate thepercentage composition. (You will learn about one example of this kind of experimental technique in section 6.4.) From the percentage composition,chemists can work backward to determine the formula of the unknowncompound.

As part of his atomic theory, John Dalton stated that atoms combine with
one another in simple whole number ratios to form compounds. Forexample, the molecular formula of benzene, C
6H6, indicates that one
molecule of benzene contains 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms. Theempirical formula (also known as the simplest formula) of a compound
shows the lowest whole number ratio of the elements in the compound.Themolecular formula (also known as the actual formula) describes the
number of atoms of each element that make up a molecule or formulaunit. Benzene, with a molecular formula of C
6H6, has an empirical
formula of CH. Table 6.1 shows the molecular formulas of several compounds, along with their empirical formulas.
Table 6.1 Comparing Molecular Formulas and Empirical Formulas
It is possible for different compounds to have the same empirical formula,
as you can see in Figure 6.6. For example, benzene and acetylene bothhave the empirical formula CH. Each, however, is a unique compound.Benzene, C
6H6, is a clear liquid with a molar mass of 78 g/mol and a boil-
ing point of 80 ˚C. Acetylene, C2H2, has a molar mass of 26 g/mol. It is a
highly ﬂammable gas, commonly used in a welder’s torch. There is, infact, no existing compound with the molecular formula CH. The empiricalformula of a compound shows the lowest wholenumber ratio of the atoms in the compound. Itdoes not express the composition of a molecule.

You will use the percentage composition of a compound, alongwith the concept of the mole, to calculate the empirical formula of thecompound.

The fact that 2.01 was rounded

age composition is often determined by experiment, soit is unlikely to be exact.PROBLEM TIP
210 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesOften only one step is needed to determine the number of moles in an
empirical formula. This is not always the case, however. Since you mustdivide by the lowest number of moles, initially one of your ratio termswill always be 1. If your other terms are quite close to whole numbers, as in the last Sample Problem, you can round them to the closest wholenumbers. If your other terms are not close to whole numbers, you willneed to do some additional steps. This is because empirical formulas do not always contain the subscript 1. For example, Fe
2O3contains the
subscripts 2 and 3.
Decimals such as 0.95 to 0.99 can be rounded up to the nearest
whole number. Decimals such as 0.01 to 0.05 can be rounded down to thenearest whole number. Other decimals require additional manipulation.What if you have the empirical formula C
1.5H3O1? To convert all sub-
scripts to whole numbers, multiply each subscript by 2. This gives youthe empirical formula C
3H6O2. Thus, a ratio that involves a decimal
ending in 0.5 must be doubled. What if a decimal ends in 0.45 to 0.55?Round the decimal so that it ends in .5, and then double the ratio.

Determining the Empirical Formula by Experiment
In practice, you can determine a compound ’s empirical formula by analyz-
ing its percentage composition. There are several different ways to do this.One way is to use a synthesis reaction in which a sample of an elementwith a known mass reacts with another element to form a compound.Since you know the mass of one of the elements and you can measure the mass of the compound produced, you can calculate the percentagecomposition.
For example, copper reacts with the oxygen in air to form the
green compound copper oxide. Many buildings in Canada, such as theParliament buildings in Ottawa, have green roofs that contain some copper(II) oxide. (See Figure 6.7.) Imagine you have a 5.0 g sample of copper shavings. You allow the copper shavings to react completely withoxygen. If the resulting compound has a mass of 6.3 g, you know that thecompound contains 5.0 g copper and 1.3 g oxygen. Although you can usethe periodic table to predict that the formula for copper(II) oxide is CuO,the masses help you con ﬁrm your prediction. Try converting the masses
given above into an empirical formula.
In Investigation 6-A, you will use a synthesis reaction to determine
the empirical formula of magnesium oxide by experiment.
Although this green
roof may contain some copper(II)oxide, it is mostly composed of basic copper sulfates and carbonates that form when thecopper reacts with acid precipitation.Figure 6.7Notice that Table 6.2 suggests

Determining the identity of an unknown compound is important in all
kinds of research. It can even be used to solve crimes. Forensic scientists
specialize in analyzing evidence for criminal and legal cases. To under-stand why forensic scientists might need to ﬁnd out the molecular
formula of a compound, consider the following example.
Suppose that a suspect in a theft investigation is a researcher in a biol-
ogy laboratory. The suspect frequently works with formaldehyde, CH
2O.
Police of ﬁcers ﬁnd traces of a substance at the crime scene, and send sam-
ples to the Centre for Forensic Science. The forensic analysts ﬁnd that the
substance contains a compound that has an empirical formula of CH2O.
Will this evidence help to convict the suspect? Not necessarily.
As you can see from Table 6.3, there are many compounds that have
the empirical formula CH2O. The substance might be formaldehyde, but it
could also be lactic acid (found in milk) or acetic acid (found in vinegar).Neither lactic acid nor acetic acid connect the theft to the suspect. Furtherinformation is required to prove that the substance is formaldehyde.Analyzing the physical properties of the substance would help to discoverwhether it is formaldehyde. Another important piece of information is themolar mass of the substance. Continue reading to ﬁnd out why.

Ben Johnson, Steve Vezina, Eric Lamaze —all
of these athletes tested positive for performance-enhancing substances that are banned by theInternational Olympic Committee (IOC). Who conducts the tests for these substances? Meet Dr. Christiane Ayotte, head of Canada ’s Doping
Control Laboratory since 1991.
The Doping Control Lab
What happens to a urine sample after it arrives atthe doping control lab? Technicians and scientistsmust be careful to ensure careful handling of thesample. Portions of the sample are taken for sixdifferent analytical procedures. More than 150substances are banned by the IOC. These sub-stances are grouped according to their physicaland chemical properties. There are two mainsteps for analyzing a sample:
1.puriﬁcation, which involves steps such as
ﬁltration and extraction using solvents, and
2.analysis by either gas chromatography, mass
spectrometry, or high-performance liquid chromatography. Chromatography refers tocertain methods by which chemists separatemixtures into pure substances.For most substances, just their presence in a
urine sample means a positive result. Other substances must be present in an amount higherthan a certain threshold. According to Dr. Ayotte,a male athlete would have to consume “10 very
strong French coffees within 15 min ” to go over
the 12 mg/L limit for caffeine. Ephedrines andpseudoephedrines, two decongestants that arefound in cough remedies and that act as stimu-lants, have a cut-off level. This allows athletes to take them up to one or two days before a competition.
Challenges
Dr. Ayotte and her team face many challenges.They look for reliable tests for natural substances,develop new analytical techniques, and deter-mine the normal levels of banned substances for male and female athletes. Dr. Ayotte mustdefend her tests in hearings and with the press,especially when high-pro ﬁle athletes get positive
results. Her dreams include an independent international doping control agency and betterdrug-risk education for athletes.
For Dr. Ayotte, integrity and a logical mind
are essential aspects of being a good scientist.

Thus, the molar mass of a compound is a whole number multiple of the
“molar mass ” of the empirical formula.
Chemists can use a mass spectrometer to determine the molar mass of a
compound. They can use the molar mass, along with the “molar mass ” of a
known empirical formula, to determine the compound ’s molecular formula.
For example, the empirical formula CH has a “molar mass ” of 13 g/mol. We
know, however, that acetylene, C2H2, and benzene, C6H6, both have the
empirical formula CH. Suppose it is determined, through mass spectrometry,
Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 217that a sample has a molar mass of 78 g/mol. We know that the compound
is C6H6, since 6×13 g=78 g, as shown in Table 6.4.

You need to ﬁnd the molecular formula of ribose.
What Is Given?
You know the empirical formula and the molar mass of ribose.
Plan Your Strategy
Divide the molar mass of ribose by the “molar mass ” of the empirical
formula. The answer you get is the factor by which you multiply theempirical formula.
Act on Your Strategy
The “molar mass ” of the empirical formula CH2O, determined using
the periodic table, is
12 g/mol +2(1) g/mol +16 g/mol =30 g/mol
The molar mass of ribose is 150 g/mol .
150 g/mol
30 g/mol=5

Therefore, the molecular formula of ribose is C5H10O5.
Check Your Solution
Work backward by calculating the molar mass of C5H10O5.
(5×12.01 g/mol) +(10×1.01 g/mol) +(5×16.00 g/mol) =150 g/mol
The calculated molar mass matches the molar mass that is given in

Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 219You have learned how to calculate the percentage composition of a
compound using its formula. Often, however, the formula of a compoundis not known. Chemists must determine the percentage composition and molar mass of an unknown compound through experimentation.Then they use this information to determine the molecular formula of the compound. Determining the molecular formula is an important step inunderstanding the properties of the compound and developing a way tosynthesize it in a laboratory.
In Investigation 6-A, you reacted a known mass of magnesium with
oxygen and found the mass of the product. Then you determined the per-centage composition and empirical formula of magnesium oxide. This isjust one method for determining percentage composition. It is suitable for analyzing simple compounds that react in predictable ways. Chemistshave developed other methods for analyzing different types of compounds, as you will learn in this section.
The Carbon-Hydrogen Combustion Analyzer
A large number of important chemicals are composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer is a
useful instrument for analyzing these chemicals. It allows chemists todetermine the percentage composition of compounds that are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The applications of this instrumentinclude forensic science, food chemistry, pharmaceuticals and academicresearch —anywhere that an unknown compound needs to be analyzed.
The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer works because we know
that compounds containing carbon and hydrogen will burn in a stream ofpure oxygen, O
2, to yield only carbon dioxide and water. If we can ﬁnd
the mass of the carbon dioxide and water separately, we can determinethe mass percent of carbon and hydrogen in the compound.
Examine Figure 6.8 to see how a carbon-hydrogen combustion analyz-
er works. A sample, made up of only carbon and hydrogen, is placed in afurnace. The sample is heated and simultaneously reacted with a stream
sample of compound containing
C, H, and other elements

combustion, all the carbon in the sample is contained in the carbon dioxide. All thehydrogen in the sample is contained in the water.Figure 6.8
220 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical Quantitiesof oxygen. Eventually the sample is completely combusted to yield only
water vapour and carbon dioxide.
The water vapour is collected by passing it through a tube that con-
tains magnesium perchlorate, Mg(ClO 4)2. The magnesium perchlorate
absorbs all of the water. The mass of the tube is determined before andafter the reaction. The difference is the mass of the water that is producedin the reaction. We know that all the hydrogen in the sample is convertedto water. Therefore, we can use the percentage composition of hydrogenin water to determine the mass of the hydrogen in the sample.
The carbon dioxide is captured in a second tube, which contains
sodium hydroxide, NaOH. The mass of this tube is also measured beforeand after the reaction. The increase in the mass of the tube corresponds to the mass of the carbon dioxide that is produced. We know that all thecarbon in the sample reacts to form carbon dioxide. Therefore, we can usethe percentage composition of carbon in carbon dioxide to determine themass of the carbon in the sample.
The carbon-hydrogen combustion analyzer can also be used to ﬁnd
the empirical formula of a compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, and one other element, such as oxygen. The difference between the massof the sample and the mass of the hydrogen and carbon produced is themass of the third element.
Examine the following Sample Problem to learn how to determine the
empirical formula of a compound based on carbon-hydrogen combustiondata.

Accident or Arson?
All chemists who try to identify unknown
compounds are like detectives. Forensicchemists, however, actually work with investi-gators. They use their chemical knowledge tohelp explain evidence. Forensic chemists areespecially helpful in an arson investigation.
Investigating Arson
One of the main jobs of the investigator in apossible arson case is to locate and sampleresidual traces of accelerants. Accelerants areﬂammable substances that are used to quickly
ignite and spread a ﬁre. They include com-
pounds called hydrocarbons, which containhydrogen and carbon. Examples of hydrocar-bons include petrol, kerosene and diesel.
Portable instruments called sniffers can be
used to determine the best places to collectsamples. These sniffers, however, are not ableto determine the type of hydrocarbon present.As well, they can be set off by vapours fromburnt plastics. Deciding whether or not a sub-stance is an accelerant is best done by achemist in a laboratory, using a techniquecalled gas chromatography (GC). In the Forensic Laboratory
In the laboratory, the sample residue must beconcentrated on charcoal or another material.Then the sample is ready for GC analysis. GC is used to separate and detect trace amounts ofvolatile hydrocarbons and separate them froma mixture. Most accelerants are complex mixtures. They have many components, in different but speci ﬁc ratios.
GC involves taking the concentrated
residue and passing it through a gas column.As the sample residue moves through the col-umn, the different components separate basedon their boiling points. The compound withthe lowest boiling point emerges from the column and onto a detector ﬁrst. The other
components follow as they reach their boilingpoints. It is possible to identify each compo-nent of a mixture based on the time that itemerges from the column. A detector recordsthis information on a chromatogram. Eachcomponent is represented by a peak on agraph. The overall pattern of peaks is alwaysthe same for a speci ﬁc type of accelerant.
Therefore, accelerants are identi ﬁed by their
components and the relative proportions oftheir components.
Only trace amounts of an accelerant need
to be collected because current analytical toolsare extremely sensitive. If an accelerant is usedto start a ﬁre, it is highly likely that there will
be trace amounts left over after the ﬁre. The
presence of an accelerant at a ﬁre scene strongly
suggests that the ﬁre was started intentionally.

Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 223Hydrated Ionic Compounds
You have learned how to ﬁnd the molecular formula of a compound that
contains only hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. When chemists use thismethod, they usually have no mass percent data for the compound whenthey begin. In some cases, however, chemists know most of the molecularformula of a compound, but one signi ﬁcant piece of information is
missing.
For example, many ionic compounds crystallize from a water solution
with water molecules incorporated into their crystal structure, forming ahydrate . Hydrates have a speci ﬁc number of water molecules chemically
bonded to each formula unit. A chemist may know the formula of theionic part of the hydrate but not how many water molecules are presentfor each formula unit.
Epsom salts, for example, consist of crystals of magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate, MgSO
4·7H2O. Every formula unit of magnesium sulfate has
seven molecules of water weakly bonded to it. A raised dot in a chemicalformula, in front of one or more water molecules, denotes a hydrated compound. Note that the dot does not include multiplication, but rather aweak bond between an ionic compound and one or more water molecules.Some other examples of hydrates are shown in Table 6.4.
Compounds that have no water molecules incorporated into them
are called anhydrous to distinguish them from their hydrated forms. For
example, a chemist might refer to CaSO
4as anhydrous calcium sulfate.
This is because it is often found in hydrated form as calcium sulfate dihydrate, shown in Figure 6.9.
Table 6.4 Selected Hydrates
The molar mass of a hydrated compound must include the mass of any
water molecules that are in the compound. For example, the molar massof magnesium sulfate heptahydrate includes the mass of 7 mol of water.It is very important to know whether a compound exists as a hydrate. Forexample, if a chemical reaction calls for 0.25 mol of copper(II) chloride,you need to know whether you are dealing with anhydrous copper(II)chloride or with copper(II) chloride dihydrate, shown in Figure 6.10. Themass of 0.25 mol of CuCl
2is 33.61 g . The mass of 0.25 mol of CuCl 2·2H2O
is 38.11 g.

Chapter 6  Chemical Proportions in Compounds • MHR 225Determining the Molecular Formula of a Hydrate
As you have just discovered, calculations involving hydrates usually
involve comparing the anhydrous form of the ionic compound to thehydrated form. Many chemicals are available in hydrated form. Usuallychemists are only interested in how much of the ionic part of the hydratethey are working with. This is because, in most reactions involvinghydrates, the water portion of the compound does not take part in thereaction. Only the ionic portion does.
How do chemists determine how many water molecules are bonded to
each ionic formula unit in a hydrate? One method is to heat the com-pound in order to convert it to its anhydrous form. The bonds that jointhe water molecules to the ionic compound are very weak compared withthe strong ionic bonds within the ionic compound. Heating a hydrate usu-ally removes the water molecules, leaving the anhydrous compoundbehind. In Investigation 6-B, you will heat a hydrate to determine its formula.Moles of H

228 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesSection Wrap-up
In section 6.4, you learned several practical methods for determining
empirical and molecular formulas of compounds. You may have noticedthat these methods work because compounds react in predictable ways.For example, you learned that a compound containing carbon and hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. Fromthe mass of the products, you can determine the amount of carbon andhydrogen in the reactant. You also learned that a hydrate decomposeswhen it is heated to form water and an anhydrous compound. Again, themass of one of the products of this reaction helps you identify the reactant.In Chapter 7, you will learn more about how to use the information fromchemical reactions in order to do quantitative calculations.
Many compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen also contain
nitrogen. Can you ﬁnd the nitrogen content by carbon-hydrogen
analysis, if the nitrogen does not interfere with the combustion reaction? If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.

Aspacecraft, such as the space shuttle on the left, requires a huge
amount of fuel to supply the thrust needed to launch it into orbit.Engineers work very hard to minimize the launch mass of a spacecraftbecause each kilogram requires additional fuel. As well, each kilogramcosts thousands of dollars to launch.
In 1969, the Apollo 11 space mission was the ﬁrst to land astronauts
on the Moon. The engineers on the project faced a challenge when decid-ing on a fuel for the lunar module. The lunar module took the astronautsfrom the Moon, back to the command module that was orbiting the Moon.The engineers chose a fuel consisting of hydrazine, N
2H4, and dinitrogen
tetroxide, N2O4. These compounds, when mixed, reacted instantaneously
and produced the energy needed to launch the lunar module from the Moon.
How do engineers know how much of each reactant they need for
a chemical reaction? In this chapter, you will use the concept of the mole to calculate the amounts of reactants that are needed to producegiven amounts of products. You will learn how to predict the amounts of products that will be produced in a chemical reaction. You will alsolearn how to apply this knowledge to any chemical reaction for whichyou know the balanced chemical equation.

Specific Expectations  Balanced chemical equations are essential for making calculations related
to chemical reactions. To understand why, consider the following analogy.
Imagine that you are making salads. You need one head of lettuce, two
cucumbers, and ﬁve radishes for each salad. Figure 7.1 shows how youcan express this as an equation.
A salad analogy showing how equations can be multiplied
Now imagine that you are making two salads. How much of each ingredient do you need? You need twice the amount that you used to make one salad, as shown in Figure 7.1.
How many salads can you make if you have three heads of lettuce,
six cucumbers, and 15 radishes? According to the salad equation, you canmake three salads.
You can get the same kind of information from a balanced chemical
equation. In Chapter 4, you learned how to classify chemical reactionsand balance the chemical equations that describe them. In Chapters 5 and6, you learned how chemists relate the number of particles in a substanceto the amount of the substance in moles and grams. In this section, youwill use your knowledge to interpret the information in a chemical equa-tion, in terms of particles, moles, and mass. Try the following Express Labto explore the molar relationships between products and reactants.Figure 7.1Stoichiometry

You can use your understanding of the relationship between moles
and number of particles to see how chemical equations communicateinformation about how many moles of products and reactants areinvolved in a reaction.
Particle Relationships in a Balanced Chemical Equation
As you learned in Chapter 4, the coefﬁcients in front of compounds andelements in chemical equations tell you how many atoms and moleculesparticipate in a reaction. A chemical equation can tell you much more,however. Consider, for example, the equation that describes the produc-tion of ammonia. Ammonia is an important industrial chemical. Severalof its uses are shown in Figure 7.2 on the following page.
236 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesAmmonia can be prepared industrially from its elements, using a process
called the Haber Process. The Haber Process is based on the balancedchemical equation below.
N
2(g)+3H2(g)→2NH 3(g)
This equation tells you that one molecule of nitrogen gas reacts with
three molecules of hydrogen gas to form two molecules of ammonia gas.
As you can see in Figure 7.3, there is the same number of each type
of atom on both sides of the equation.
You can use a ratio to express the numbers of atoms in the equation,
as follows:
1 molecule N2:3molecules H2:2molecules NH 3
What happens if you multiply the ratio by 2? You get
2 molecules N2:6molecules H2:4molecules NH 3
This means that two molecules of nitrogen gas react with six molecules of
hydrogen gas to produce four molecules of ammonia gas. Multiplying theoriginal ratio by one dozen gives the following relationship:1 dozen molecules N
2:3dozen molecules H2:2dozen molecules NH 3
Suppose that you want to produce 20 molecules of ammonia. How
many molecules of nitrogen do you need? You know that you need onemolecule of nitrogen for every two molecules of ammonia produced. Inother words, the number of molecules of nitrogen that you need is onehalf the number of molecules of ammonia that you want to produce.
20 molecules NH
3×1 molecule N 2
2 molecules NH 3=10 molecules N 2

Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 237Mole Relationships in Chemical Equations
Until now, you have assumed that the coefﬁcients in a chemical equation
represent particles. They can, however, also represent moles. Consider thefollowing ratio to ﬁnd out why.
1 molecule N
2:3molecules H2:2molecules NH 3
You can multiply the above ratio by the Avogadro constant to obtain
1×NAmolecules N2:3×NAmolecules H2:2×NAmolecules NH 3
This is the same as
1 mol N 2: 3 mol H 2: 2 mol NH 3
So the chemical equation N2(g)+3H2(g)→2NH 3(g)also means that
1 mol of nitrogen molecules reacts with 3 mol of hydrogen molecules toform 2 mol of ammonia molecules. The relationships between moles in abalanced chemical equation are called mole ratios . For example, the mole
ratio of nitrogen to hydrogen in the equation above is 1 mol N
2:3 mol H2.
The mole ratio of hydrogen to ammonia is 3 mol H2:2 mol NH 3. 1.Consider the following reaction.

ulate ratios involving molecules. For example, suppose that you want toknow how many moles of ammonia are produced by 2.8 mol of hydrogen.You know that you can obtain 2 mol of ammonia for every 3 mol ofhydrogen. Therefore, you multiply the number of moles of hydrogen bythe mole ratio of ammonia to hydrogen.

Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 239Different Ratios of Reactants
The relative amounts of reactants are important. Different mole ratios of
the same reactants can produce different products. For example, carboncan combine with oxygen in two different ratios, forming either carbonmonoxide or carbon dioxide. In the following reaction, the mole ratio ofcarbon to oxygen is 2 mol C:1 mol O
2.
2C(s)+O2(g)→2CO (g)
In the next reaction, the mole ratio of carbon to oxygen is
1 mol C:1 mol O2.
C(s)+O2(g)→CO2(g)
Thus, carbon dioxide forms if carbon and oxygen are present in a mole
ratio of about 1 mol C:1 mol O2. Carbon dioxide is a product of cellular
respiration in animals and humans, and it is a starting material for photo-synthesis. It is also one of the products of the complete combustion of ahydrocarbon fuel.
If there is a relative shortage of oxygen, however, and the mole ratio
of carbon to oxygen is closer to 2 mol C:1 mol O, carbon monoxide forms.Carbon monoxide is colourless, tasteless, and odourless. It is a highly poisonous gas, that is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in Canada and the United States every year. Carbon monoxide can escapefrom any fuel-burning appliance: furnace, water heater, ﬁreplace, woodstove, or space heater. If you have one of these appliances in your home,make sure that it has a good supply of oxygen to avoid the formation ofcarbon monoxide.
There are many reactions in which different mole ratios of the reactants
result in different products. The following Sample Problem will help youunderstand how to work with these reactions.In many areas, it is mandatory
for every home to have a car-bon monoxide detector, like theone shown below. If you do nothave a carbon monoxidedetector in your home, you canbuy one at a hardware storefor a modest price. It could endup saving your life.

Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 241Mass Relationships in Chemical Equations
As you have learned, the coefﬁcients in a balanced chemical equation rep-
resent moles as well as particles. Therefore, you can use the molar massesof reactants and products to determine the mass ratios for a reaction. Forexample, consider the equation for the formation of ammonia:
N
2(g)+3H2(g)→2NH 3(g)
You can ﬁnd the mass of each substance using the equation m=M×n
as follows:
1 mol N 2×28.0 g/mol N2=28.0 g N2
3 mol H 2×2.02 g/mol H2=6.1 g H2
2 mol NH 3×17.0 g/mol NH3=34.1 g NH3
In Table 7.1, you can see how particles, moles, and mass are related in a
chemical equation. Notice that the mass of the product is equal to thetotal mass of the reactants. This conﬁrms the law of conservation of mass.

Stoichiometric Mass Calculations
You now know what a balanced chemical equation tells you in terms
of number of particles, number of moles, and mass of products and reactants. How do you use this information? Because reactants and products are related by a ﬁxed ratio, if you know the number of moles
of one substance, the balanced equation tells you the number of moles of all the other substances. In Chapters 5 and 6, you learned how to convert between particles, moles, and mass. Therefore, if you know the
amount of one substance in a chemical reaction (in particles, moles, ormass), you can calculate the amount of any other substance in the reaction (in particles, moles, or mass), using the information in the balanced chemical equation.
You can see that a balanced chemical equation is a powerful tool. It
allows chemists to predict the amount of products that will result from areaction involving a known amount of reactants. As well, chemists canuse a balanced equation to calculate the amount of reactants they willneed to produce a desired amount of products. They can also use it to predict the amount of one reactant they will need to react completely with another reactant.Refer back to Chapter 5.
Calculate the molar mass of N

242 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesStoichiometry is the study of the relative quantities of reactants and
products in chemical reactions. Stoichiometric calculations are used for many purposes. One purpose is determining how much of a reactant isneeded to carry out a reaction. This kind of knowledge is useful for anychemical reaction, and it can even be a matter of life or death.
In a spacecraft, for example, carbon dioxide is produced as the astro-
nauts breathe. To maintain a low level of carbon dioxide, air in the cabinis passed continuously through canisters of lithium hydroxide granules.The carbon dioxide reacts with the lithium hydroxide in the followingway:
CO
2(g)+2LiOH (s)→Li2CO3(s)+H2O(g)
The canisters are changed periodically as the lithium hydroxide reacts.
Engineers must calculate the amount of lithium hydroxide needed toensure that the carbon dioxide level is safe. As you learned earlier, everykilogram counts in space travel. Therefore, a spacecraft cannot carry muchmore than the minimum amount.
A spacecraft is a closed system. All chemical reactions must be taken into
account when engineers design systems to keep the air breathable.
To determine how much lithium hydroxide is needed, engineers need to
ask and answer two important questions:•How much carbon dioxide is produced per astronaut each day?
•How much lithium hydroxide is needed per kilogram of carbon
dioxide?
Engineers can answer the ﬁrst question by experimenting. To answer the
second question, they need to do stoichiometric calculations. Examine thefollowing Sample Problems to see how these calculations would be done.Figure 7.4
The word “stoichiometry” is

Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 251A balanced chemical equation shows the mole ratios of the reactants
and products. To emphasize this, the coef ﬁcients of equations are some-
times called stoichiometric coefﬁcients . Reactants are said to be present
in stoichiometric amounts when they are present in a mole ratio that
corresponds exactly to the mole ratio predicted by the balanced chemicalequation. This means that when a reaction is complete, there are no reactants left. In practice, however, there often arereactants left.
In the previous section, you looked at an “equation ” for making a
salad. You looked at situations in which you had the right amounts ofingredients to make one or more salads, with no leftover ingredients.
1 head of lettuce +2 cucumbers +5 radishes →1 salad
What if you have two heads of lettuce, 12 cucumbers, and 25 radishes,
as in Figure 7.5? How many salads can you make? Because each saladrequires two heads of lettuce, you can make only two salads. Here theamount of lettuce limits the number of salads you can make. Some of theother two ingredients are left over.
Which ingredient limits how many salads can be made?
Chemical reactions often work in the same way. For example, consider
the ﬁrst step in extracting zinc from zinc oxide:
ZnO (s)+C(s)→Zn(s)+CO(g)
If you were carrying out this reaction in a laboratory, you could obtain
samples of zinc oxide and carbon in a 1:1 mole ratio. In an industrial setting, however, it is impractical to spend time and money ensuring thatzinc oxide and carbon are present in stoichiometric amounts. It is alsounnecessary. In an industrial setting, engineers add more carbon, in theform of charcoal, than is necessary for the reaction. All the zinc oxidereacts, but there is carbon left over.Figure 7.5
excess ingredients
The Limiting Reactant
252 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesHaving one or more reactants in excess is very common.
Another example is seen in gasoline-powered vehicles. Theiroperation depends on the reaction between fuel and oxygen.Normally, the fuel-injection system regulates how much airenters the combustion chamber, and oxygen is the limitingreactant. When the fuel is very low, however, fuel becomesthe limiting reactant and the reaction cannot proceed, as inFigure 7.6.
In nature, reactions almost never have reactants in
stoichiometric amounts. Think about respiration, representedby the following chemical equation:
C
6H12O6(s)+6O2(g)→6CO 2(g)+6H2O(/lscript)
When an animal carries out respiration, there is an unlimit-
ed amount of oxygen in the air. The amount of glucose,
however, depends on how much food the animal has eaten.All the gasoline in this car ’s tank has
reacted. Thus, even though there is still oxygenavailable in the air, the combustion reaction cannotproceed.Figure 7.6

Determining the Limiting Reactant
The reactant that is completely used up in a chemical reaction is called
the limiting reactant . In other words, the limiting reactant determines
how much product is produced. When the limiting reactant is used up,the reaction stops. In real-life situations, there is almost always a limitingreactant.
A reactant that remains after a reaction is over is called the excess
reactant . Once the limiting reactant is used, no more product can be
made, regardless of how much of the excess reactants may be present.
Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 253When you are given amounts of two or more reactants to solve a
stoichiometric problem, you ﬁrst need to identify the limiting reactant.
One way to do this is to ﬁnd out how much product would be produced
by each reactant if the other reactant were present in excess. The reactantthat produces the least amount of product is the limiting reactant.Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to use this approach toidentify the limiting reactant.

You need to determine whether lithium nitride or water is the limiting reactant.
What Is Given?

Product: ammonia, NH 3

3 mol H 2O×(0.322 mol H 2O)

The water would produce less ammonia than the lithium nitride.
Therefore, the limiting reactant is water. Notice that there is morewater than lithium nitride, in terms of mass and moles. Water is thelimiting reactant, however, because 3 mol of water are needed toreact with 1 mol of lithium nitride.
Check Your Solution
According to the balanced chemical equation, the ratio of lithiumnitride to water is 1/3. The ratio of lithium nitride to water, based on the mole amounts calculated, is 0.14:0.32. Divide this ratio by0.14 to get 1.0:2.3. For each mole of lithium nitride, there are only2.3 mol water. However, 3 mol are required by stoichiometry.Therefore, water is the limiting reactant.

256 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesThe Limiting Reactant in Stoichiometric Problems
You are now ready to use what you know about ﬁnding the limiting reac-
tant to predict the amount of product that is expected in a reaction. Thistype of prediction is a routine part of a chemist ’s job, both in academic
research and industry. To produce a compound, for example, chemistsneed to know how much product they can expect from a given reaction.In analytical chemistry, chemists often analyze an impure substance byallowing it to react in a known reaction. They predict the expected massof the product(s) and compare it with the actual mass of the product(s)obtained. Then they can determine the purity of the compound.
Since chemical reactions usually occur with one or more of the
reactants in excess, you often need to determine the limiting reactantbefore you carry out stoichiometric calculations. You can incorporate this step into the process you have been using to solve stoichiometricproblems, as shown in Figure 7.7.

Section Wrap-up
You now know how to identify a limiting reactant. This allows you to
predict the amount of product that will be formed in a reaction. Often,however, your prediction will not accurately re ﬂect reality. When a
chemical reactions occurs —whether in a laboratory, in nature, or in
industry —the amount of product that is formed is often different from
the amount that was predicted by stoichiometric calculations. You willlearn why this happens, and how chemists deal with it, in section 7.3.
Why do you not need to consider reactants that are present in
excess amounts when carrying out stoichiometric calculations? Use an everyday analogy to explain the idea of excess quantity.

Actual yield is a measured
quantity. Theoretical yield is acalculated quantity.FACTCHEMWhen you write an examination, the highest grade that you can earn
is usually 100%. Most people, however, do not regularly earn a grade of100%. A percentage on an examination is calculated using the followingequation:
Percentage grade =Marks earned
Maximum possible marks×100%
Similarly, a batter does not succeed at every swing. A batter ’s success rate
is expressed as a decimal fraction. The decimal can be converted to a per-cent by multiplying by 100%, as shown in Figure 7.8. In this section, youwill learn about a percentage that chemists use to predict and express the“success ” of reactions.
A baseball player ’s batting average is calculated as hits/attempts. For
example, a player with 6 hits for 21 times at bat has a batting average of 6/21 =0.286 .
This represents a success rate of 28.6%.
Theoretical Yield and Actual Yield
Chemists use stoichiometry to predict the amount of product that can
be expected from a chemical reaction. The amount of product that is predicted by stoichiometry is called the theoretical yield . This predicted
yield, however, is not always the same as the amount of product that isactually obtained from a chemical reaction. The amount of product that is obtained in an experiment is called the actual yield .
Why Actual Yield and Theoretical Yield Are Often Different
The actual yield of chemical reactions is usually less than the theoretical
yield. This is caused by a variety of factors. For example, sometimes lessthan perfect collection techniques contribute to a lower than expectedyield.
A reduced yield may also be caused by a competing reaction : a
reaction that occurs at the same time as the principal reaction andinvolves its reactants and/or products. For example, phosphorus reactswith chlorine to form phosphorus trichloride. Some of the phosphorustrichloride, however, can then react with chlorine to form phosphorus pentachloride.Figure 7.8
Percentage Yield
Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 261Here are the chemical equations for these competing reactions:
2P(s)+3Cl 2(g)→2PCl 3(/lscript)
PCl 3(/lscript)+Cl2(g)→PCl 5(s)
Therefore, not all the phosphorus is converted to phosphorus
trichloride. So the actual yield of phosphorus trichloride is less than the theoretical yield.
Experimental design and technique may affect the actual yield, as
well. For example, suppose that you need to obtain a product by ﬁltration.
Some of the product may remain in solution and therefore not be caughton the ﬁlter paper.
Another common cause of reduced yield is impure reactants. The
theoretical yield is calculated based on the assumption that reactants arepure. You will learn about the effects of impure reactants on page 265.
Calculating Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of a chemical reaction compares the mass of product
obtained by experiment (the actual yield) with the mass of product determined by stoichiometric calculations (the theoretical yield). It is calculated as follows:
Percentage yield =

to produce ammonia. You assumed that all the nitrogen and hydrogenreacted. Under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, this is areasonable assumption. When ammonia is produced industrially, how-ever, temperature and pressure are manipulated to maximize the speed of production.

264 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesApplications of Percentage Yield
The percentage yield of chemical reactions is extremely important in
industrial chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. For example, thesynthesis of certain drugs involves many sequential chemical reactions.Often each reaction has a low percentage yield. This results in a tiny overall yield. Research chemists, who generally work with small quanti-ties of reactants, may be satis ﬁed with a poor yield. Chemical engineers,
on the other hand, work with very large quantities. They may use hun-dreds or even thousands of kilograms of reactants! A difference of 1% in the yield of a reaction can translate into thousands of dollars.
The work of a chemist in a laboratory can be likened to making
spaghetti for a family. The work of a chemical engineer, by contrast, is likemaking spaghetti for 10 000 people! Learn more about chemical engineersin Careers in Chemistry on the next page. Then perform an investigationto determine the percentage yield of a reaction on page 266.34.The following reaction proceeds with a 70% yield.

Chapter 7  Quantities in Chemical Reactions • MHR 265Percentage Purity
Often impure reactants are the cause of a percentage yield of less than
100%. Impurities cause the mass data to be incorrect. For example, sup-pose that you have 1.00 g of sodium chloride and you want to carry out areaction with it. You think that the sodium chloride may have absorbedsome water, so you do not know exactly how much pure sodium chlorideyou have. If you calculate a theoretical yield for your reaction based on1.00 g of sodium chloride, your actual yield will be less. There is not 1.00 g of sodium chloride in the sample.Careers in Chemistry
Chemical Engineer
Chemical engineers are sometimes described
as “universal engineers ” because of their unique
knowledge of math, physics, engineering, andchemistry. This broad knowledge allows them to work in a variety of areas, from designing paint factories to developing better tasting, morenutritious foods. Canadian chemical engineersare helping to lead the world in making cheap,long-lasting, and high-quality CDs and DVDs. In addition to designing and operating commer-cial plants, chemical engineers can be found in university labs, government agencies, and consulting ﬁrms.
Producing More for Less
Once chemists have developed a product in a lab-
oratory, it is up to chemical engineers to design a process to make the product in commercialquantities as ef ﬁciently as possible. “Scaling up ”
production is not just a matter of using largerbeakers. Chemical engineers break down thechemical process into a series of smaller “unit
operations ” or processes and techniques.
They use physics, chemistry, and complex mathematical models. For example, making liquid
pharmaceutical products (such as syrups, solu-tions, and suspensions) on a large scale involvesadding speci ﬁc amounts of raw materials to large
mixing tanks. Then the raw materials are heatedto a set temperature and mixed at a set speed for a given amount of time. The ﬁnal product is
ﬁltered and stored in holding tanks. Chemical
engineers ensure that each process produces the maximum amount of product.
Becoming a Chemical Engineer
To become a chemical engineer, you need a bachelor ’s degree in chemical engineering. Most
provinces also require a Professional Engineer (P . Eng.) designation. Professional engineers must have at least four years of experience andmust pass an examination. As well, they mustcommit to continuing their education to keep upwith current developments. Chemical engineersmust be able to work well with people and tocommunicate well.
Make Career Connections
1.Discuss engineering studies and careers withworking engineers, professors, and engineer-ing students. Look for summer internship programs and job shadowing opportunities.Browse the Internet. Contact your provincialengineering association, engineering societies,and universities for more information.
2.Participate in National Engineering Week inCanada in March of each year. This is whenpostsecondary institutions, companies, sciencecentres, and other organizations hold specialevents, including engineering contests andworkshops.

268 MHR • Unit 2  Chemical QuantitiesIn the mining industry, metals are usually
recovered in the form of an ore. An ore is a naturally occurring rock that contains a high
concentration of one or more metals. Whether an ore can beproﬁtably mined depends on several factors: the cost of
mining and re ﬁning the ore, the price of the extracted metal,
and the cost of any legal and environmental issues related toland use. The inaccurate chemical analysis of an ore samplecan cost investors millions of dollars if the ore deposit doesnot yield what was expected.
The percentage purity of a sample describes what
proportion, by mass, of the sample is composed of a speci ﬁc
compound or element. For example, suppose that a sampleof gold has a percentage purity of 98%. This means thatevery 100 g of the sample contains 98 g of gold and 2 g ofimpurities.
You can apply your knowledge of stoichiometry and
percentage yield to solve problems related to percentagepurity.

2O3, and sulfur dioxide, SO2.

by experiment relates to the theoretical yield predicted by stoichiometry.You have learned about many factors that affect actual yield, including thenature of the reaction, experimental design and execution, and the purityof the reactants.

Using Stoichiometry
Background
Analytical chemists are employed in industrial
research, academic research, and forensic sci-ence. Their job usually involves two differenttypes of work: qualitative analysis and quantita-
tive analysis . A qualitative analysis determines
which substances are present. A quantitativeanalysis determines how much of a specific substance is present.
Many other chemists also need to use the
principles of analytical chemistry. An environ-mental chemist, for example, tests water or soilfor the presence and amounts of impurities. Inthis investigation, you will design a procedure to analyze a sample of contaminated sand.
This analyst is collecting run-off water for testing.
Pre-Lab Focus
A shipment of sand has become contaminatedwith barium chloride, BaCl
2, and sodium
chloride, NaCl. As an analytical chemist, yourjob is to design a procedure to determine the percent by mass of each substance in the sand.You will need to use the following double
displacement reaction. This reaction produces a precipitate of barium sulfate.
BaCl
2(aq)+Na2SO4(aq)→BaSO 4(s)+2NaCl (aq)
To design your procedure, carefully consider
the physical and chemical properties of the twosubstances in the mixture.
Question
How can you determine the percent by mass of barium chloride and the percent by mass ofsodium chloride in the sand?
Hypothesis

Keeping ﬁsh as pets seems like a
simple and straightforward task. Youstart off with a suitable ﬁsh tank,some water, and some ﬁsh. Onceyou have added a few water-plantsfor decoration, all you have to do isfeed the ﬁsh daily. It sounds simple.
In fact, providing a safe, life-
sustaining environment for ﬁshinvolves a variety of complex, interdependent factors. Many ofthese are directly related to chem-istry. For example, the presence ofammonia, NH
3, is one of the most
common causes of death in poorlymaintained ﬁsh tanks. Ammonia isproduced when uneaten ﬁsh fooddecays. This compound dissolvesreadily in water. It is toxic to ﬁsh in even minute concentrations.
Chlorine is another chemical
that can harm ﬁsh when it is dissolved in the tank water.Unfortunately, almost all tap wateris treated with chlorine. Other factorsthat affect the quality of water forﬁsh include its acidity (pH), itshardness, and its temperature. Forexample, warm water contains toolittle dissolved oxygen. This willcause the ﬁsh to suffocate.
Water quality is essential to
every living thing. In this unit, youwill ﬁnd out more about water qual-ity. You will learn to identify impor-tant solutions in your life, and howto calculate their concentrations.You will also investigate what canhappen when acids and bases inter-act with water and with each other.Solutions

Your environment is made up of many important solutions, or
homogeneous mixtures. The air you breathe and the liquids you drink aresolutions. So are many of the metallic objects that you use every day. Thequality of a solution, such as tap water, depends on the substances thatare dissolved in it. “Clean” water may contain small amounts of dissolvedsubstances, such as iron and chlorine. “Dirty” water may have dangerouschemicals dissolved in it.
The difference between clean water and undrinkable water often
depends on concentration: the amount of a dissolved substance in a particular quantity of a solution. For example, tap water contains a lowconcentration of ﬂuoride to help keep your teeth healthy. Water with ahigh concentration of ﬂuoride, however, could be harmful to your health.
Water is a good solvent for many substances. You may have noticed,
however, that grease-stained clothing cannot be cleaned by water alone.Grease is one substance that does not dissolve in water. Why doesn’t itdissolve? In this chapter, you will ﬁnd out why. You will learn how solutions form. You will explore factors that affect a substance’s ability to dissolve. You will ﬁnd out more about the concentration of solutions,and you will have a chance to prepare your own solutions as well.

Specific Expectations  As stated in the chapter opener, a solution is a homogeneous mixture. It
is uniform throughout. If you analyze any two samples of a solution, youwill ﬁnd that they contain the same substances in the same relativeamounts. The simplest solutions contain two substances. Most commonsolutions contain many substances.
A solvent is any substance that has other substances dissolved in it.
In a solution, the substance that is present in the largest amount (whetherby volume, mass, or number of moles) is usually referred to as the solvent.The other substances that are present in the solution are called the solutes .
Pure substances (such as pure water, H
2O) have ﬁxed composition.
You cannot change the ratio of hydrogen, H, to oxygen, O, in water without producing an entirely new substance. Solutions, on the otherhand, have variable composition . This means that different ratios of
solvent to solute are possible. For example, you can make a weak or astrong solution of sugar and water, depending on how much sugar youadd. Figure 8.1 shows a strong solution of tea and water on the left, and aweak solution of tea and water on the right. The ratio of solvent to solutein the strong solution is different from the ratio of solvent to solute in theweak solution.
How can a solution have variable composition yet be uniform throughout?
When a solute dissolves in a solvent, no chemical reaction occurs.
Therefore, the solute and solvent can be separated using physical properties, such as boiling point or melting point. For example, water and ethanol have different boiling points. Using this property, a solutionof water and ethanol can be separated by the process of distillation. Referback to Chapter 1, section 1.2. What physical properties, besides boilingpoint, can be used to separate the components of solutions and other mixtures?Figure 8.1

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 285Can you identify the components of some of these solutions?
A solution can be a gas, a liquid, or a solid. Figure 8.2 shows some
examples of solutions. Various combinations of solute and solvent statesare possible. For example, a gas can be dissolved in a liquid, or a solidcan be dissolved in another solid. Solid, liquid, and gaseous solutions are all around you. Steel is a solid solution of carbon in iron. Juice is a liquid solution of sugar and ﬂavouring dissolved in water. Air is anexample of a gaseous solution. The four main components of dry air arenitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%), and carbon dioxide (0.03%).Table 8.1 lists some other common solutions.

286 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityYou are probably most familiar with liquid solutions, especially
aqueous solutions. An aqueous solution is a solution in which water is
the solvent. Because aqueous solutions are so important, you will focuson them in the next two sections of this chapter and again in Chapter 9.
Some liquids, such as water and ethanol, dissolve readily in each
other in any proportion. That is, any amount of water dissolves in anyamount of ethanol. Similarly, any amount of ethanol dissolves in anyamount of water. Liquids such as these are said to be miscible with
each other. Miscible liquids can be combined in any proportions. Thus,either ethanol or water can be considered to be the solvent. Liquids thatdo not readily dissolve in each other, such as oil and water, are said to be immiscible .
As you know from Chapter 4, solid solutions of metals are called
alloys . Adding even small quantities of another element to a metal
changes the properties of the metal. Technological advances throughouthistory have been linked closely to the discovery of new alloys. For example, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze contains only about 10% tin, but it is much stronger than copper and more resistant tocorrosion. Also, bronze can be melted in an ordinary ﬁre so that castings
can be made, as shown in Figure 8.3.
Solubility and Saturation
The ability of a solvent to dissolve a solute depends on the forces ofattraction between the particles. There is always some attraction betweensolvent and solute particles, so some solute always dissolves. The solubility of a solute is the amount of solute that dissolves in a given
quantity of solvent, at a certain temperature. For example, the solubility of sodium chloride in water at 20 ˚C is 36 g per 100 mL of water.
A saturated solution is formed when no more
solute will dissolve in a solution, and excess solute ispresent. For example, 100 mL of a saturated solution of table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water at 20 ˚C
contains 36 g of sodium chloride. The solution is saturated with respect to sodium chloride. If more sodium chloride is added to the solution, it will notdissolve. The solution may still be able to dissolveother solutes, however.
An unsaturated solution is a solution that is not
yet saturated. Therefore, it can dissolve more solute.For example, a solution that contains 20 g of sodiumchloride dissolved in 100 mL of water at 20 ˚C is unsat-
urated. This solution has the potential to dissolveanother 16 g of salt, as Figure 8.4 demonstrates.An alloy that is made of a
metal dissolved in mercury iscalled an amalgam . A tradition-
al dental amalgam, used to ﬁllcavities in teeth, contains 50%mercury. Due to concern overthe use of mercury, which istoxic, dentists now use othermaterials, such as ceramicmaterials, to ﬁll dental cavities.FACTCHEM

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 287Suppose that a solute is described as soluble in a particular solvent.
This generally means that its solubility is greater than 1 g per 100 mL ofsolvent. If a solute is described as insoluble , its solubility is less than 0.1 g
per 100 mL of solvent. Substances with solubility between these limits arecalled sparingly soluble , or slightly soluble . Solubility is a relative term,
however. Even substances such as oil and water dissolve in each other tosome extent, although in very tiny amounts.
The general terms that are used to describe solubility for solids and
liquids do not apply to gases in the same way. For example, oxygen isdescribed as soluble in water. Oxygen from the air dissolves in the waterof lakes and rivers. The solubility of oxygen in fresh water at 20 ˚C is only
9 mg/L, or 0.0009 g/100 mL. This small amount of oxygen is enough toensure the survival of aquatic plants and animals. A solid solute with thesame solubility, however, would be described as insoluble in water.
Identifying Suitable Solvents
Water is a good solvent for many compounds, but it is a poor solvent forothers. If you have grease on your hands after adjusting a bicycle chain,you cannot use water to dissolve the grease and clean your hands. Youneed to use a detergent, such as soap, to help dissolve the grease in thewater. You can also use another solvent to dissolve the grease. How canyou ﬁnd a suitable solvent?

Specific Expectations  As you learned in section 8.1, the solubility of a solute is the amount of
solute that dissolves in a given volume of solvent at a certain temperature.Solubility is determined by the intermolecular attractions between solventand solute particles. You will learn more about solubility and the factorsthat affect it later in this section. First, however, you will look at animportant property of a solution: the rate of dissolving , or how quickly a
solute dissolves in a solvent.
The rate of dissolving depends on several factors, including tempera-
ture, agitation, and particle size. You have probably used these factorsyourself when making solutions like the fruit juice shown in Figure 8.5.
Fruit juice is soluble in water. The concentrated juice in this photograph,
however, will take a long time to dissolve. Why?
Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving
You may have observed that a solute, such as sugar, dissolves faster in
hot water than in cold water. In fact, for most solid solutes, the rate of
dissolving is greater at higher temperatures . At higher temperatures, the
solvent molecules have greater kinetic energy. Thus, they collide with theundissolved solid molecules more frequently. This increases their rate ofdissolving.
Suppose that you are dissolving a spoonful of sugar in a cup of hot
coffee. How can you make the sugar dissolve even faster? You can stir the coffee. Agitating a mixture by stirring or by shaking the container
increases the rate of dissolving . Agitation brings fresh solvent into contact
with undissolved solid.
Finally, you may have noticed that a large lump of solid sugar
dissolves more slowly than an equal mass of powdered sugar. Decreasing
the size of the particles increases the rate of dissolving . When you break
up a large mass into many smaller masses, you increase the surface areathat is in contact with the solvent. This allows the solid to dissolve faster.Figure 8.6 shows one way to increase the rate of dissolving. Figure 8.5
Factors That Affect Rate of
Dissolving and Solubility
Chemists often grind
solids into powders using a mortarand pestle. This increases the rateof dissolving.Figure 8.6
Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 291Solubility and Particle Attractions
By now, you are probably very familiar with the process of dissolving.
You already know what it looks like when a solid dissolves in a liquid.Why, however, does something dissolve? What is happening at the molecular level?
The reasons why a solute may or may not dissolve in a solvent are
related to the forces of attraction between the solute and solvent particles.These forces include the attractions between two solute particles, theattractions between two solvent particles, and the attractions between asolute particle and a solvent particle. When the forces of attractionbetween different particles in a mixture are stronger than the forces of
attraction between likeparticles in the mixture, a solution forms. The
strength of each attraction in ﬂuences the solubility, or the amount of a
solute that dissolves in a solvent.
To make this easier to understand, consider the following three steps
in the process of dissolving a solid in a liquid.
The solid is more likely to dissolve in the liquid if the energy change in
step 3 is greater than the sum of the energy changes in steps 1 and 2. (You will learn more about energy and dissolving in Unit 5.)
Polar and Non-Polar Substances
In the Thought Lab in section 8.1, you observed that solid iodine is insoluble in water. Only a weak attraction exists between the non-polariodine molecules and the polar water molecules. On the other hand, theintermolecular forces between the water molecules are very strong. As aresult, the water molecules remain attracted to each other rather thanattracting the iodine molecules.
You also observed that iodine is soluble in kerosene. Both iodine
and kerosene are non-polar substances. The attraction that iodine andkerosene molecules have for each other is greater than the attractionbetween the iodine molecules in the solid and the attraction between thekerosene molecules in the liquid.
The Concept Organizer shown on the next page summarizes the
behaviour of polar and non-polar substances in solutions. You will learnmore about polar and non-polar substances later in this section.The Process of Dissolving at the Molecular Level
Step 1 The forces between the particles in the solid must be broken.
This step always requires energy. In an ionic solid, the forcesthat are holding the ions together must be broken. In a molecu-lar solid, the forces between the molecules must be broken.
Step 2 Some of the intermolecular forces between the particles in theliquid must be broken. This step also requires energy.
Step 3 There is an attraction between the particles of the solid and theparticles of the liquid. This step always gives off energy.Calculate the surface area

292 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilitySolubility and Intermolecular Forces
You have learned that solubility depends on the forces between particles.
Thus, polar substances dissolve in polar solvents, and non-polar substances dissolve in non-polar solvents. What are these forces that actbetween particles?
In Chapter 3, section 3.3, you learned that a water molecule is polar.
It has a relatively large negative charge on the oxygen atom, and positivecharges on both hydrogen atoms. Molecules such as water, which havecharges separated into positive and negative regions, are said to have apermanent dipole. A dipole consists of two opposite charges that are sepa-
rated by a short distance. Figure 8.7 shows the dipole of a water molecule.
Dipole-Dipole Attractions
The attraction between the opposite charges on two different polar mole-
cules is called a dipole-dipole attraction . Dipole-dipole attractions are
intermolecular. This means that they act between molecules. Usually they
are only about 1% as strong as an ionic or covalent bond. In water, thereis a special dipole-dipole attraction called hydrogen bonding . It occurs
between the oxygen atom on one molecule and the hydrogen atoms on anearby molecule. Hydrogen bonding is much stronger than an ordinarydipole-dipole attraction. It is much weaker, however, than the covalentbond between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule. Figure 8.8 illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 293Ion-Dipole Attractions
Ionic crystals consist of repeating patterns of oppositely charged ions, as
shown in Figure 8.9. What happens when an ionic compound comes incontact with water? The negative end of the dipole on some water mole-cules attracts the cations on the surface of the ionic crystal. At the sametime, the positive end of the water dipole attracts the anions. These attrac-tions are known as ion-dipole attractions : attractive forces between an ion
and a polar molecule. If ion-dipole attractions can replace the ionic bondsbetween the cations and anions in an ionic compound, the compoundwill dissolve. Generally an ionic compound will dissolve in a polar
solvent . For example, table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is an ionic
compound. It dissolves well in water, which is a polar solvent.
When ions are present in an aqueous solution, each ion is hydrated .
This means that it is surrounded by water molecules. Hydrated ions canmove through a solution and conduct electricity. A solute that forms anaqueous solution with the ability to conduct electricity is called an electrolyte . Figure 8.10 shows hydrated sodium chloride ions, which
are electrolytes.
An Exception: Insoluble Ionic Compounds
Although most ionic compounds are soluble in water, some are not very
soluble at all. The attraction between ions is dif ﬁcult to break. As a result,
compounds with very strong ionic bonds, such as silver chloride, tend tobe less soluble in water than compounds with weak ionic bonds, such assodium chloride.
Predicting Solubility
You can predict the solubility of a binary compound, such as mercury(II)sulﬁde, HgS, by comparing the electronegativity of each element in the
compound. If there is a large difference in the two electronegativities, thebond between the elements is polar or even ionic. This type of compoundprobably dissolves in water. If there is only a small difference in the twoelectronegativities, the bond is not polar or ionic. This type of compoundprobably does not dissolve in water. For example, the electronegativity ofmercury is 1.9. The electronegativity of sulfur is 2.5. The difference inthese two electronegativities is small, only 0.6. Therefore, you can predictthat mercury(II) sul ﬁde is insoluble in water. In Chapter 9, you will learn
another way to predict the solubility of ionic compounds in water.

294 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityThe Solubility of Covalent Compounds
Many covalent compounds do not have negative and positive charges to
attract water molecules. Thus they are not soluble in water. There aresome exceptions, however. Methanol (a component of windshield washerﬂuid), ethanol (the “alcohol ” in alcoholic beverages), and sugars (such as
sucrose) are examples of covalent compounds that are extremely solublein water. These compounds dissolve because their molecules containpolar bonds, which are able to form hydrogen bonds with water.
For example, sucrose molecules have a number of sites that can
form a hydrogen bond with water to replace the attraction between thesucrose molecules. (See Figure 8.11.) The sucrose molecules separate andbecome hydrated, just like dissolved ions. The molecules remain neutral,however. As a result, sucrose and other soluble covalent compounds donot conduct electricity when dissolved in water. They are non-electrolytes .
Insoluble Covalent Compounds
The covalent compounds that are found in oil and grease are insoluble
in water. They have no ions or highly polar bonds, so they cannot formhydrogen bonds with water molecules. Non-polar compounds tend to besoluble in non-polar solvents, such as benzene or kerosene. The forcesbetween the solute molecules are replaced by the forces between thesolute and solvent molecules.
In general, ionic solutes and polar covalent solutes both dissolve in
polar solvents. Non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents . The
phrase like dissolves like summarizes these observations. It means that
solutes and solvents that have similar properties form solutions.
If a compound has both polar and non-polar components, it may
dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents. For example, acetic acid,
CH
3COOH , is a liquid that forms hydrogen bonds with water. It is fully
miscible with water. Acetic acid also dissolves in non-polar solvents, such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, because the CH

is non-polar.CH

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 295Factors That Affect Solubility
You have taken a close look at the attractive forces between solute and
solvent particles. Now that you understand why solutes dissolve, it istime to examine the three factors that affect solubility: molecule size, temperature, and pressure. Notice that these three factors are similar tothe factors that affect the rate of dissolving. Be careful not to confuse them.
Molecule Size and Solubility
Small molecules are often more soluble than larger molecules. Methanol,
CH
3OH, and ethanol, CH3CH2OH, are both completely miscible with
water. These compounds have OH groups that form hydrogen bonds withwater. Larger molecules with the same OH group but more carbon atoms,such as pentanol, CH
3CH2CH2CH2CH2OH, are far less soluble. All three
compounds form hydrogen bonds with water, but the larger pentanol is less polar overall, making it less soluble. Table 8.2 compares ﬁve
molecules by size and solubility.
Table 8.2 Solubility and Molecule Size
Temperature and Solubility
At the beginning of this section, you learned that temperature affects
the rate of dissolving. Temperature also affects solubility. You may havenoticed that solubility data always include temperature. The solubility of a solute in water, for example, is usually given as the number of gramsof solute that dissolve in 100 mL of water at a speci ﬁc temperature. (See
Table 8.2 for two examples.) Specifying temperature is essential, since thesolubility of a substance is very different at different temperatures.
When a solid dissolves in a liquid, energy is needed to break the
strong bonds between particles in the solid. At higher temperatures, moreenergy is present. Thus, the solubility of most solids increases with tem-
perature . For example, caffeine ’s solubility in water is only 2.2 g/100 mL
at 25 ˚C. At 100 ˚C, however, caffeine ’s solubility increases to 40 g/100 mL.
The bonds between particles in a liquid are not as strong as the bonds
between particles in a solid. When a liquid dissolves in a liquid, addition-al energy is not needed. Thus, the solubility of most liquids is not greatly
affected by temperature .
Gas particles move quickly and have a great deal of kinetic energy.
When a gas dissolves in a liquid, it loses some of this energy. At highertemperatures, the dissolved gas gains energy again. As a result, the gascomes out of solution and is less soluble. Thus, the solubility of gases
decreases with higher temperatures .
In the next investigation, you will observe and graph the effect
of temperature on the solubility of a solid dissolved in a liquid solvent,water. As you have learned, most solid solutes become more soluble athigher temperatures. By determining the solubility of a solute at varioustemperatures, you can make a graph of solubility against temperature. Thecurve of best ﬁt, drawn through the points, is called the solubility curve .
You can use a solubility curve to determine the solubility of a solute atany temperature in the range shown on the graph.Name of compound

In this Express Lab, you will have a chance to
see how a change in temperature affects the dissolved gas in a solution. You will be looking at the pH of soda water. A low pH (1 –6) indicates
that the solution is acidic. You will learn moreabout pH in Chapter 10.
Safety Precautions
•If using a hot plate, avoid touching it when it
is hot.
•If using a Bunsen burner, check that there are
no ﬂammable solvents nearby.
Procedure
1.Open a can of cool soda water. (Listen for the
sound of excess carbon dioxide escaping.)Pour about 50 mL into each of two 100 mLbeakers. Note the rate at which bubbles form.Record your observations.
2.Add a few drops of universal indicator to bothbeakers. Record the colour of the solutions.Then estimate the pH. 3.Measure and record the mass of each beaker.Measure and record the temperature of thesoda water.

298 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityHeat Pollution: A Solubility Problem
For most solids, and almost all ionic substances, solubility increases as
the temperature of the solution increases. Gases, on the other hand,always become lesssoluble as the temperature increases. This is why a
refrigerated soft drink tastes ﬁzzier than the same drink at room tempera-
ture. The warmer drink contains less dissolved carbon dioxide than thecooler drink.
This property of gases makes heat pollution a serious problem. Many
industries and power plants use water to cool down overheated machin-ery. The resulting hot water is then returned to local rivers or lakes. Figure 8.12 shows steam rising from a “heat-polluted ” river. Adding
warm water into a river or lake does not seem like actual pollution. Theheat from the water, however, increases the temperature of the body ofwater. As the temperature increases, the dissolved oxygen in the waterdecreases. Fish and other aquatic wildlife and plants may not haveenough oxygen to breathe.
The natural heating of water in rivers and lakes can pose problems,
too. Fish in warmer lakes and rivers are particularly vulnerable in thesummer. When the water warms up even further, the amount of dissolvedoxygen decreases.
This image shows
the result of heat pollution.Warmer water contains less dissolved oxygen.Figure 8.12
Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 299Pressure and Solubility
The ﬁnal factor that affects solubility is pressure. Changes in pressure
have hardly any effect on solid and liquid solutions. Such changes doaffect the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent, however. The solubility ofthe gas is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the liquid.For example, the solubility of oxygen in lake water depends on the airpressure above the lake.
When you open a carbonated drink, you can observe the effect of pres-
sure on solubility. Figure 8.13 shows this effect. Inside a soft drink bottle,the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas is very high: about 400 kPa. Whenyou open the bottle, you hear the sound of escaping gas as the pressure isreduced. Carbon dioxide gas escapes quickly from the bottle, since thepressure of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is much lower: onlyabout 0.03 kPa. The solubility of the carbon dioxide in the liquid softdrink decreases greatly. Bubbles begin to rise in the liquid as gas comesout of solution and escapes. It takes a while for all the gas to leave thesolution, so you have time to enjoy the taste of the soft drink before itgoes “ﬂat.”
Figure 8.14 illustrates another example of dissolved gases and
pressure. As a scuba diver goes deeper underwater, the water pressureincreases. The solubility of nitrogen gas, which is present in the lungs,also increases. Nitrogen gas dissolves in the diver ’s blood. As the diver
returns to the surface, the pressure acting on the diver decreases. Thenitrogen gas in the blood comes out of solution. If the diver surfaces tooquickly, the effect is similar to opening a soft drink bottle. Bubbles ofnitrogen gas form in the blood. This leads to a painful and sometimes fatal condition known as “the bends. ” You will learn more about gases
and deep-sea diving in Chapter 11.
Scuba divers must heed the effects of decreasing water pressure on
dissolved nitrogen gas in their blood. They must surface slowly to avoid “the bends. ”Figure 8.14
Do you crack your knuckles?
The sound you hear is another example of the effectof pressure on solubility. Jointscontain ﬂuid. When a joint is
suddenly pulled or stretched,the cavity that holds the ﬂuid
gets larger. This causes thepressure to decrease. A bubble of gas forms, makingthe sound you hear. You cannotrepeatedly crack your knucklesbecause it takes some time forthe gas to re-dissolve. FACTCHEM

when the pressure of the carbondioxide gas in a soft drink bottleis released? The solubility of thegas in the soft drink solutiondecreases.Figure 8.13
Solvents and Coffee: What ’s the Connection?
The story of coffee starts with the coffee berry.
First the pulp of the berry is removed. Thisleaves two beans, each containing 1% to 2%caffeine. The beans are soaked in water andnatural enzymes to remove the outer parch-ment husk and to start a slight fermentationprocess. Once the beans have been fermented,they are dried and roasted. Then the coffee isready for grinding. Grinding increases the sur-face area of the coffee. Thus, ﬁner grinds make
it easier to dissolve the coffee in hot water.
Decaffeinated coffee satis ﬁes people who
like the smell and taste of coffee but cannot tolerate the caffeine. How is caffeine removedfrom coffee?
All the methods of extracting caffeine take
place before the beans are roasted. Caffeine andthe other organic compounds that give coffeeits taste are mainly non-polar. (Caffeine doescontain some polar bonds, however, whichallows it to dissolve in hot water.) Non-polarsolvents, such as benzene and trichloroethene,were once used to dissolve and remove caffeine from the beans. These chemicals arenow considered to be too hazardous. Todaymost coffee manufacturers use water or carbondioxide as solvents.In the common Swiss Water Process,
coffee beans are soaked in hot water. This dissolves the caffeine and the ﬂavouring
compounds from the beans. The liquid ispassed through activated carbon ﬁlters. The
ﬁlters retain the caffeine, but let the ﬂavouring
compounds pass through. The ﬁltered liquid,
now caffeine-free, is sprayed back onto thebeans. The beans reabsorb the ﬂavouring
compounds. Now they are ready for roasting.
Carbon dioxide gas is a normal component
of air. In the carbon dioxide decaffeinationprocess, the gas is raised to a temperature of atleast 32 ˚C. Then it is compressed to a pressure
of about 7400 kPa. At this pressure, it resem-bles a liquid but can ﬂow like a gas. The
carbon dioxide penetrates the coffee beans and dissolves the caffeine. When the pressurereturns to normal, the carbon dioxide reverts to a gaseous state. The caffeine is left behind.
What happens to the caffeine that is
removed by decaffeination? Caffeine is so valuable that it is worth more than the cost oftaking it out of the beans. It is extensively usedin the pharmaceutical industry, and for colasand other soft drinks.
Making Connections
1.As you have read, water is a polar liquidand the soluble fractions of the coffeegrounds are non-polar. Explain, in chemicalterms, how caffeine and the coffee ﬂavour
and aroma are transferred to hot coffee.

3.In chemical terms, explain why ﬁne grinds

Specific Expectations
Phenol is a hazardous liquid, especially when it is at room temperature.
It is a volatile chemical. Inhaling phenol adversely affects the central nervous system, and can lead to a coma. Inhalation is not the only danger.Coma and death have been known to occur within 10 min after phenol hascontacted the skin. Also, as little as 1 g of phenol can be fatal if swallowed.
Would you expect to ﬁnd such a hazardous chemical in over-the-
counter medications? Check your medicine cabinet at home. You may ﬁnd phenol listed as an ingredient in throat sprays and in lotions to
relieve itching. You may also ﬁnd it used as an antiseptic or disinfectant.
Is phenol a hazard or a bene ﬁcial ingredient in many medicines? This
depends entirely on concentration : the amount of solute per quantity of
solvent. At high concentrations, phenol can kill. At low concentrations, it is a safe component of certain medicines.
Modern analytical tests allow chemists to detect and measure almost
any chemical at extremely low concentrations. In this section, you willlearn about various ways that chemists use to express the concentration of a solution. As well, you will ﬁnd the concentration of a solution by
experiment.
Concentration as a Mass/Volume Percent
Recall that the solubility of a compound at a certain temperature is oftenexpressed as the mass of the solute per 100 mL of solvent. For example,you know that the solubility of sodium chloride is 36 g/100 mL of water atroom temperature. The ﬁnal volume of the sodium chloride solution may
or may not be 100 mL. It is the volume of the solvent that is important.
Chemists often express the concentration of an unsaturated solution
as the mass of solute dissolved per volume of the solution . This is differ-
ent from solubility. It is usually expressed as a percent relationship. Amass/volume percent gives the mass of solute dissolved in a volume of
solution, expressed as a percent. The mass/volume percent is also referredto as the percent (m/v) .The Concentration of Solutions

Concentration as a Mass/Mass Percent
The concentration of a solution that contains a solid solute dissolved in
a liquid solvent can also be expressed as a mass of solute dissolved in amass of solution. This is usually expressed as a percent relationship. A mass/mass percent gives the mass of a solute divided by the mass of
solution, expressed as a percent. The mass/mass percent is also referred toas the percent (m/m) , or the mass percent . It is often inaccurately referred
to as a weight (w/w) percent, as well. Look at your tube of toothpaste, athome. The percent of sodium ﬂuoride in the toothpaste is usually given as
a w/w percent. This can be confusing, since weight ( w) is not the same as
mass ( m). In fact, this concentration should be expressed as a mass/mass
percent.
For example, 100 g of seawater contains 0.129 g of magnesium ion
(along with many other substances). The concentration of Mg
2+in
seawater is 0.129 (m/m). Notice that the number of grams of solute
per 100 g of solution is numerically equal to the mass/mass percent .

The concentration of a very small quantity of a substance in the human
body, or in the environment, can be expressed in parts per million (ppm)
and parts per billion (ppb) . Both parts per million and parts per billion
are usually mass/mass relationships. They describe the amount of solutethat is present in a solution. Notice that parts per million does not refer to the number of particles, but to the mass of the solute compared with
the mass of the solution.

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 313Molar Concentration
The most useful unit of concentration in chemistry is molar concentra-
tion. Molar concentration is the number of moles of solute in 1 L of
solution. Notice that the volume of the solution in litres is used, rather
than the volume of the solvent in millilitres . Molar concentration is also
known as molarity .
This formula can be shortened to give
C=n
V
Molar concentration is particularly useful to chemists because it is related
to the number of particles in a solution. None of the other measures ofconcentration are related to the number of particles. If you are given themolar concentration and the volume of a solution, you can calculate theamount of dissolved solute in moles. This allows you to solve problemsinvolving quantities in chemical reactions, such as the ones on the following pages.Molar concentration (in mol/L) =Amount of solute (in mol)

Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 319
What do the effectiveness of a medicine, the safety of a chemical reaction,
and the cost of an industrial process have in common? They all dependon solutions that are made carefully with known concentrations. A solution with a known concentration is called a standard solution . There
are two ways to prepare an aqueous solution with a known concentration.You can make a solution by dissolving a measured mass of pure solute in a certain volume of solution. Alternatively, you can dilute a solution ofknown concentration.
Using a Volumetric Flask
A volumetric ﬂask is a pear-shaped glass container with a ﬂat bottom and
a long neck. Volumetric ﬂasks like the ones shown in Figure 8.19 are used
to make up standard solutions. They are available in a variety of sizes.Each size can measure a ﬁxed volume of solution to ±0.1 mL at a particu-
lar temperature, usually 20 ˚C. When using a volumetric ﬂask, you must
ﬁrst measure the mass of the pure solute. Then you transfer the solute to
the ﬂask using a funnel, as shown in Figure 8.20. At this point, you add
the solvent (usually water) to dissolve the solute, as in Figure 8.21. Youcontinue adding the solvent until the bottom of the meniscus appears totouch the line that is etched around the neck of the ﬂask. See Figure 8.22.
This is the volume of the solution, within ±0.1 mL. If you were perform-ing an experiment in which signi ﬁcant digits and errors were important,
you would record the volume of a solution in a 500 mL volumetric ﬂask
as 500.0 mL ±0.1 mL. Before using a volumetric ﬂask, you need to rinse
it several times with a small quantity of distilled water and discard thewashings. Standard solutions are never stored in volumetric ﬂasks . Instead,
they are transferred to another bottle that has a secure stopper or cap.Preparing Solutions
These volumetric
ﬂasks, from left to right, contain
solutions of chromium(III) salts,iron(III) salts, and cobalt(II) salts.Figure 8.19
Transfer a
known mass of solid soluteinto the volumetric ﬂask.
Alternatively, dissolve thesolid in a small volume ofsolvent. Then add the liquidto the ﬂask.Add distilled
water until the ﬂask is about
half full. Swirl the mixturearound in order to dissolvethe solute completely. Rinsethe beaker that containedthe solute with solvent. Addthe rinsing to the ﬂask.
Figure 8.21 Figure 8.20 Add the rest of
the water slowly. When theﬂask is almost full, add the
water drop by drop until thebottom of the meniscus restsat the etched line.Figure 8.22
320 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityDiluting a Solution
You can make a less concentrated solution of a known solution by adding
a measured amount of additional solvent to the standard solution. Thenumber of molecules, or moles, of solute that is present remains the samebefore and after the dilution. (See Figure 8.23.)
To reinforce these ideas, read through the Sample Problem below.
Then try the Practice Problems that follow.
Problem
For a class experiment, your teacher must make 2.0 L of 0.10 mol/L
sulfuric acid. This acid is usually sold as an 18 mol/L concentratedsolution. How much of the concentrated solution should be used tomake a new solution with the correct concentration?
What Is Required?
You need to ﬁnd the volume of concentrated solution to be diluted.
What Is Given?
Initial concentration =18 mol/L
Concentration of diluted solution =0.10 mol/L
Volume of diluted solution =2.0 L
Plan Your Strategy
Note: Amount of solute (mol) after dilution =Amount of solute

Step 2 Calculate the volume of the concentrated solution that will
provide the necessary amount of solute.Sample Problem
Diluting a Standard Solution
Continued ...When a solution is
diluted, the volume increases.However, the amount of soluteremains the same.Figure 8.23
Chapter 8  Solutions and Their Concentrations • MHR 321Act on Your Strategy
Step 1 Calculate the amount of solute that is needed for the ﬁnal
dilute solution.
Molar concentration (in mol/L) =Amount of solute (in mol)
Volume of solution (in L)
∴Amount of solute =Molar concentration ×Volume of solution
For the ﬁnal dilute solution,
Amount of solute =0.10 mol/L ×2.0 L
=0.20 mol
Step 2 Calculate the volume of the original concentrated solution
that is needed.
Rearrange and use the molar concentration equation.
Substitute in the amount of solute you calculated in step 1.
Volume of solution (in L) =Amount of solute (in mol)
Molar concentration (in mol/L)
=0.20 mol
18 mol/L
=0.011 L
Therefore, 0.011 L, or 11 mL, of the concentrated 18 mol/L solution
should be used to make 2.0 L of 0.10 mol/L sulfuric acid.
Check Your Solution
The units are correct. The ﬁnal solution must be much less
concentrated. Thus, it is reasonable that only a small volume of concentrated solution is needed.

324 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityDiluting Concentrated Acids
The acids that you use in your investigations are bought as concentrated
standard solutions. Sulfuric acid is usually bought as an 18 mol/L solu-tion. Hydrochloric acid is usually bought as a 12 mol/L solution. Theseacids are far too dangerous for you to use at these concentrations. Yourteacher dilutes concentrated acids, following a procedure that minimizesthe hazards involved.
Concentrated acids should be diluted in a fume hood because
breathing in the fumes causes acid to form in air passages and lungs.Rubber gloves must be used to protect the hands. A lab coat is needed to protect clothing. Even small splashes of a concentrated acid will formholes in fabric. Safety goggles, or even a full-face shield, are essential.
Mixing a strong, concentrated acid with water is a very exothermic
process. A concentrated acid is denser than water. Therefore, when it ispoured into water, it sinks into the solution and mixes with the solution.The heat that is generated is spread throughout the solution. This is the only safe way to mix an acid and water. If you added water to a concentrated acid, the water would ﬂoat on top of the solution. The heat
generated at the acid-water layer could easily boil the solution and splat-ter highly corrosive liquid. The sudden heat generated at the acid-waterboundary could crack the glassware and lead to a very dangerous spill.Figure 8.24 illustrates safety precautions needed to dilute a strong acid.

Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 329Aqueous Solutions
In 1966, a Russian scientist who was lecturing in England stunned the
scientiﬁc community with the report of a new discovery. He said that acolleague had isolated a new form of liquid water. Dubbed “polywater,”this substance was prepared in a laboratory by heating and then condens-ing H
2O(g)in very narrow glass capillary tubes. Over the next seven years,
scientists around the world conducted studies and published over 500papers about polywater’s properties. For example, its boiling point, density, and viscosity were greater than those of ordinary water. Its freezing point was lower.
Then the popular media took an interest. They turned a simmering
scientiﬁc curiosity into a boiling concern. Polywater apparently had apowerful capacity for hydrogen bonding. What if it escaped from a laboratory? There were dire predictions that polywater would “take over”Earth’s water resources. The imagined consequences for life on Earth were grim.
Eventually further studies revealed that polywater was simply a
concentrated solution of silicon (silicic acid) and several ionic com-pounds in ordinary water. The glass tubing was the source of thesesolutes. They had leached into the water.
The polywater event occurred because scientists overlooked, for
awhile, water’s remarkable power as a solvent. In this chapter, you willlearn how to predict which compounds are soluble in water. As well, you will consider how chemical reactions in aqueous (water) solutions are useful in industry and in protecting the quality of our water supplies.9.1 Making Predictions About

Specific Expectations  In Chapter 8, you examined factors that affect the solubility of a com-
pound. As well, you learned that the terms “soluble” and “insoluble” arerelative, because no substance is completely insoluble in water. “Soluble”generally means that more than about 1 g of solute will dissolve in 100mL of water at room temperature. “Insoluble” means that the solubility isless than 0.1 g per 100 mL. While many ionic compounds are soluble inwater, many others are not. Cooks, chemists, farmers, pharmacists, and gardeners need to know which compounds are soluble and which areinsoluble. (See Figure 9.1.)
Factors That Affect the Solubility of Ionic Substances
Nearly all alkali metal compounds are soluble in water. Sulﬁde and phosphate compounds are usually insoluble. How, then, do you accountfor the fact that sodium sulﬁde and potassium phosphate are soluble,while iron sulﬁde and calcium phosphate are insoluble? Why do someions form soluble compounds, while other ions form insoluble compounds?
The Effect of Ion Charge on Solubility
Compounds of ions with small charges tend to be soluble. Compounds of
ions with large charges tend to be insoluble. Why? Increasing the charge
increases the force that holds the ionstogether. For example, phosphates (com-pounds of PO
43−) tend to be insoluble. On
the other hand, the salts of alkali metals are soluble. Alkali metal cations have a single positive charge, so the force thatholds the ions together is less.
Making Predictions
About Solubility
Because the terms “soluble”
and “insoluble” are relative,some textbooks give differentdeﬁnitions and units of con-centration to describe them.Here are a few examples:FACTCHEMPlant food may
come in the form of a liquid or a powder. Gardeners dissolve the plant food in water, and theneither spray or water the plantwith the resulting solution.Figure 9.1

Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 331The Effect of Ion Size on Solubility
When an atom gives up or gains an electron, the size of the ion that results
is different from the size of the original atom. In Figure 9.2A, for example,you can see that the sodium ion is smaller than the sodium atom. In general, the ions of metals tend to be smaller than their corresponding neutral atoms. For the ions of non-metals, the reverse is true. The ions ofnon-metals tend to be larger than their corresponding neutral atoms.
Small ions bond more closely together than large ions. Thus, the bond
between small ions is stronger than the bond between large ions with the same charge. As a result, compounds with small ions tend to be lesssoluble than compounds with large ions. Consider the ions of elementsfrom Group 17 (VIIA), for example. Recall, from Chapters 2 and 3, that thesize of the ions increases as you go down a family in the periodic table.(See Figure 9.2B.) Therefore, you would expect that ﬂuoride compounds
are less soluble than chloride, bromide, and iodide compounds. Thistends to be the case.
Making Predictions About Solubility
Sulﬁdes (compounds of S
2−) and oxides (compounds of O2−) are in ﬂuenced
by both ion size and ion charge. These compounds tend to be insolublebecause their ions have a double charge andare relatively small. Even so, a
few sul ﬁdes and oxides are soluble, as you will discover in Investigation 1-A.
Many interrelated factors affect the solubility of substances in water.
This makes it challenging to predict which ionic substances will dissolvein water. By performing experiments, chemists have developed guidelinesto help them make predictions about solubility. In Investigation 9-A, you will perform your own experiments to develop quidelines about the solubility of ionic compounds in water.

that may result when two aqueous solutionschemically react. The appearance of a precipi-
tate indicates that an insoluble compound ispresent. Then you will compile your data with
the data from other groups to develop someguidelines about the solubility of several ioniccompounds.

Read the entire Procedure. Predict which combination of anions and cations will likely be soluble and which combination will likely be insoluble. Justify your prediction by brie ﬂy
explaining your reasoning.
Materials

Na+, Zn2+
labelled dropper bottles of aqueous solutions that
contain the following anions:
CH3COO−, Br−, CO32−, Cl−, OH−, PO43−,
SO42−, S2−Safety Precautions
•Do not contaminate the dropper bottles. The
tip of a dropper should not make contact witheither the plate or another solution. Put the capback on the bottle immediately after use.
•Dispose of solutions as directed by your
teacher.
•Make sure that you are working in a well-
ventilated area.
•If you accidentally spill any of the solutions on
your skin, wash the area immediately withplenty of cool water.
Procedure
1.Your teacher will give you a set of nine solutions to test. Each solution includes oneof ﬁve cations or four anions. Design a table
to record the results of all the possible combinations of cations with anions in your set of solutions.
2.Decide how to use the well plate or spot plateto test systematically all the combinations ofcations with anions in your set. If your platedoes not have enough wells, you will need to clean the plate before you can test all thepossible combinations. To clean the plate, ﬁrst
discard solutions into the container providedby your teacher. Then rinse the plate with distilled water, and clean the wells using acotton swab.
3.To test each combination of anion and cation,add one or two drops into your well plate orspot plate. Then stir the mixture using atoothpick. Rinse the toothpick with runningwater before each stirring. Make sure that youkeep track of the combinations of ions in eachwell or spot.
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 333Why is it necessary to clean the well or spot plate as
described in step 2?
4.Examine each mixture for evidence of a
precipitate. Place the plate on a sheet of white or black paper. (Use whichever colourof paper helps you see a precipitate best.) Anycloudy appearance in the mixture is evidenceof a precipitate. Many precipitates are white.
•If you can see that a precipitate has formed,
enter “I” in your table. This indicates that
the combination of ions produces an insoluble substance.
•If you cannot see a precipitate, enter “S”
to indicate that the ion you are testing is soluble.
5.Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each cation solution.
6.Discard the solutions and precipitates into thecontainer provided by your teacher. Rinse theplate with water, and clean the wells using acotton swab.
7.If time permits, your teacher may give you asecond set of solutions to test.
8.Add your observations to the class data table.Use your completed copy of the class datatable to answer the questions below.

1.Identify any cations that
(a)always appear to form soluble compounds
(b)always appear to form insoluble compounds2.Identify any anions that

(b)always appear to form insoluble compounds
3.Based on your observations, which sulfatesare insoluble?
4.Based on your observations, which phosphates are soluble?
5.Explain why each reagent solution you testedmust contain both cations and anions.
6.Your teacher prepared the cation solutionsusing compounds that contain the nitrate ion.For example, the solution marked Ca

prepared by dissolving Ca(NO 3)2in water.
Why were nitrates used to make these solutions?
Conclusions
7.Which group in the periodic table most likely forms cations with salts that are usually soluble?
8.Which group in the periodic table most likely forms anions with salts that are usually soluble?
9.Your answers to questions 7 and 8 represent a preliminary set of guidelines for predictingthe solubility of the compounds you tested.Many reference books refer to guidelines likethese as “solubility rules. ” Why might “solu-
bility guidelines ” be a better term to use for
describing solubility patterns?
Application
10.Predict another combination of an anion and a cation (not used in this investigation)that you would expect to be soluble. Predictanother combination that you would expect to be insoluble. Share your predictions, andyour reasons, with the class. Account for anyagreement or disagreement.
334 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilitySoluble or Insoluble: General Solubility Guidelines
As you have seen, nearly all salts that contain the ammonium ion or an
alkali metal are soluble. This observed pattern does not tell you how solu-ble these salts are, however. As well, it does not tell you whether ammo-nium chloride is more or less soluble than sodium chloride. Chemists relyon published data for this information. (See Figure 9.3.)
Many factors affect solubility. Thus, predicting solubility is neither
straightforward nor simple. Nevertheless, the general solubility guidelines
in Table 9.1 are a useful summary of ionic-compound interactions withwater. To use Table 9.1, remember that a higher guideline number alwaystakes precedence over a lower guideline number. For example, bariumchloride, BaCl
2, is a white crystalline powder. The barium ion, Ba2+, is
listed in guideline 4 as insoluble. The chloride ion, Cl−, is listed in
guideline 3 as soluble. The higher guideline number takes precedence.Thus, you would predict that barium chloride is soluble.
You will be referring to the general solubility guidelines often in this
chapter and in Chapter 10. They will help you identify salts that are solu-ble and insoluble in aqueous solutions. Always keep in mind, however,that water is a powerful solvent. Even an “insoluble ” salt may dissolve
enough to present a serious hazard if it is highly poisonous.

In Chapter 8, you focussed mainly on physical changes that involve
solutions. In the ﬁrst section of this chapter, you observed that mixing
aqueous solutions of ionic compounds may result in either a physicalchange (dissolving) or a chemical change (a reaction that forms a precipi-tate). Chemical changes that involve aqueous solutions, especially ionicreactions, are common. They occur in the environment, in your body, and in the bodies of other organisms. In the next section, you will lookmore closely at reactions that involve aqueous solutions. As well, you willlearn how to represent these reactions using a special kind of chemicalequation, called an ionic equation.1.Decide whether each of the following salts is soluble or insoluble indistilled water.

Name a chemi-cal that can be used to precipitate a silver compound with the silvernitrate solution, but will produce no precipitate with the calciumnitrate solution. State the reason for your choice.

•silver, Ag+
•sulfate, SO42−.
Unfortunately the labels have not been attached to the bottles. You
decide to number the bottles 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then you mix the solutionsin pairs. Three combinations give white precipitates: bottles 1 and 2, 1and 4, and 2 and 3. Which ion does each bottle contain?C 6C 5MC4K/U 3K/U 2K/U 1Section Review

Every single sulfate
Is soluble it’s said, Except barium and calcium And strontium and lead.
Most every chloride’s soluble,
That’s what we’ve always read,Save silver, mercurous mercury,And (slightly) chloride of lead.
When asked about the nitrates,
The answer’s always clear;They each and all are soluble,That’s all we want to hear.
Metallic bases won’t dissolve,
That is, all but three;Potassium, sodium, and ammonium Dissolve quite readily.
But then you must remember,
You must surely not forget,Calcium and barium Dissolve a little bit.
Carbonates are insoluble,
It’s lucky that it’s so, Or all our marble buildingsWould melt away like snow.LanguageLINK
When you mix two aqueous ionic compounds together, there are two
possible outcomes. Either the compounds will remain in solution withoutreacting, or one aqueous ionic compound will chemically react with theother. How can you predict which outcome will occur? Figure 9.4 showswhat happens when an aqueous solution of lead(II) nitrate is added to anaqueous solution of potassium iodide. As you can see, a yellow solid —a
precipitate —is forming. This is a double displacement reaction. Recall,
from Chapter 4, that a double displacement reaction is a chemical reactionthat involves the exchange of ions to form two new compounds. It has thegeneral equation
WX+YZ→WZ+YX
In a double displacement reaction, the cations exchange anions. In the
reaction shown in Figure 9.4, for example, the lead cation is exchangedwith the iodide anion.
You can usually recognize a double displacement reaction by
observing one of these possible results:
•the formation of a precipitate (so that ions are removed from solution
as an insoluble solid)
•the formation of a gas (so that ions are removed from solution in the
form of a gaseous product)
•the formation of water (so that H
+and OH−ions are removed from
solution as water)
In this section, you will examine each of these results. At the same time,
you will learn how to represent a double displacement reaction using aspecial kind of chemical equation: an ionic equation.

Double displacement reactions
are also called metathesis
reactions . The word “meta-
thesis” (pronounced with thestress on the second syllable:meh-TATH-e-sis) means “interchange.” In chemistry, a metathesis reaction occurswhen ions or atoms areexchanged between differentcompounds. Chemists are not the only people who usethis word. Use a dictionary or encyclopedia to ﬁnd non-chemistry examples ofmetathesis.LanguageLINK
Lead(II) nitrate
and potassium iodide are clear,colourless aqueous solutions.Mixing them causes a doubledisplacement reaction. An insoluble yellow precipitate(lead(II) iodide) and a soluble salt (potassium nitrate) are produced.Figure 9.4
338 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityDouble Displacement Reactions That Produce a Precipitate
A double displacement reaction that results in the formation of an insolu-
ble substance is often called a precipitation reaction . Figure 9.4 is a clear
example of a precipitation reaction. What if you did not have this photo-graph, however, and you were unable to do an experiment? Could youhave predicted that mixing Pb(NO
3)(aq)and 2KI (aq)would result in an
insoluble compound? Yes. When you are given (on paper) a pair of solu-tions to be mixed together, start by thinking about the exchange of ionsthat may occur. Then use the general solubility guidelines (Table 9.1) topredict which compounds, if any, are insoluble.
For example, consider lead(II) nitrate, Pb(NO
3)2, and potassium
iodide, KI. Lead(II) nitrate contains Pb2+cations and NO 3−anions.
Potassium iodide contains K+cations and I−anions. Exchanging positive
ions results in lead(II) iodide, PbI 2, and potassium nitrate, KNO 3. From
the solubility guidelines, you know that all potassium salts and nitratesare soluble. Thus, potassium nitrate is soluble. The Pb
2+ion is listed in
guideline 2 as an insoluble cation. The I−ion is listed in guideline 3 as
a soluble anion. Remember that a higher guideline number takes prece-dence over a lower guideline number. Thus, you can predict that lead(II)iodide is insoluble. It will form a precipitate when the solutions aremixed. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is
Pb(NO
3)2(aq)+2KI (aq)→2KNO 3(aq)+PbI 2(s)
Problem
Which of the following pairs of aqueous solutions produce a precipi-
tate when mixed together? Write the balanced chemical equation ifyou predict a precipitate. Write “NR” if you predict that no reaction
takes place.
(a)potassium carbonate and copper(II) sulfate
(b)ammonium chloride and zinc sulfate
What Is Required?
You need to predict whether or not each pair of aqueous solutionsforms an insoluble product (a precipitate). If it does, you need towrite a balanced chemical equation.
What Is Given?
You know the names of the compounds in each solution.

Start by identifying the ions in each pair of compounds. Thenexchange the positive ions in the two compounds. Compare theresulting compounds against the solubility guidelines, and makeyour prediction.Sample Problem

(a)Potassium carbonate contains K+and CO32−ions. Copper(II) sul-
fate contains Cu2+and SO42−ions. Exchanging positive ions results
in potassium sulfate, K2SO4, and copper(II) carbonate, CuCO 3.
All potassium salts are soluble, so these ions remain dissolved
in solution.
The copper(II) ion is listed in guideline 5 as a soluble cation. The
carbonate anion is listed in guideline 2 as insoluble. Becauseguideline 2 is higher, copper(II) carbonate should be insoluble. Soyou can predict that a precipitate forms. The balanced chemicalequation for this reaction is
K
2CO3(aq)+CuSO 4(aq)→K2SO4(aq)+CuCO 3(s)
(b)Ammonium chloride contains NH 4+and Cl−ions. Zinc sulfate
consists of Zn2+and SO42−ions. Exchanging positive ions results
in ammonium sulfate, (NH 4)2SO4, and zinc chloride, ZnCl 2.
Since all ammonium salts are soluble, the ammonium sulfate
stays dissolved in solution.
Zinc chloride consists of a guideline 5 soluble cation and a guide-
line 3 soluble anion. Because guideline 3 is higher, zinc chlorideshould be soluble. Thus, you can predict that no precipitate forms.

possible, obtain samples of these solutions from your teacher, andmix them together.

340 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityDouble Displacement Reactions That Produce a Gas
Double displacement reactions are responsible for producing a number
of gases. (See Figure 9.5.) These gases include •hydrogen
•hydrogen sul ﬁde (a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs)
•sulfur dioxide (a reactant in forming acid rain)
•carbon dioxide
•ammonia
A Reaction that Produces Hydrogen Gas
The alkali metals form bonds with hydrogen to produce compounds
called hydrides. Hydrides react readily with water to produce hydrogengas. Examine the following equation for the reaction of lithium hydride,LiH, with water. If you have dif ﬁculty visualizing the ion exchange that
takes place, rewrite the equation for yourself using HOH instead of H
2O.
LiH (s)+H2O(/lscript)→LiOH (aq)+H2(g)
A Reaction that Produces Hydrogen Sulﬁde Gas
Sulﬁdes react with certain acids, such as hydrochloric acid, to produce
hydrogen sul ﬁde gas.
K2S(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2KCl (aq)+H2S(g)
A Reaction that Produces Sulfur Dioxide Gas
Some reactions produce a compound that, afterward, decomposes into
a gas and water. Sodium sul ﬁte is used in photography as a preservative.
It reacts with hydrochloric acid to form sulfurous acid. The sulfurous acidthen breaks down into sulfur dioxide gas and water. The net reaction isthe sum of both changes. If the same compound appears on both sides ofan equation (as sulfurous acid, H
2SO3, does here), it can be eliminated.
This is just like eliminating terms from an equation in mathematics.
Na2SO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+H2SO3(aq)
H2SO3(aq)→SO2(g)+H2O(/lscript)
Therefore, the net reaction is
Na2SO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+SO2(g)+H2O(/lscript)
A Reaction that Produces Carbon Dioxide Gas
The reaction of a carbonate with an acid produces carbonic acid. Carbonic
acid decomposes rapidly into carbon dioxide and water.
Na2CO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+H2CO3(aq)
H2CO3(aq)→CO2(g)+H2O(/lscript)
The net reaction is
Na2CO3(aq)+2HCl (aq)→2NaCl (aq)+CO2(g)+H2O(/lscript)
A Reaction that Produces Ammonia Gas
Ammonia gas is very soluble in water. You can detect it easily, however,
by its sharp, pungent smell. Ammonia gas can be prepared by the reactionof an ammonium salt with a base.
NH
4Cl(aq)+NaOH (aq)→NaCl (aq)+NH 3(aq)+H2O(/lscript)You can easily
identify limestone and marble bytheir reaction with hydrochloricacid. The gas that is produced by this double displacement reaction is carbon dioxide.Figure 9.5
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 341Double Displacement Reactions That Produce Water
The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base is a very
important double displacement reaction. In a neutralization reaction,water results when an H
+ion from the acid bonds with an OH−ion
from the base.
H2SO4(aq)+2NaOH (aq)→Na2SO4(aq)+2H2O(/lscript)
Most metal oxides are bases. Therefore, a metal oxide will react with an
acid in a neutralization reaction to form a salt and water.
2HNO 3(aq)+MgO (s)→Mg(NO 3)2(aq)+H2O(/lscript)
Non-metal oxides are acidic. Therefore, a non-metal oxide will react
with a base. This type of reaction is used in the space shuttle. Cabin air is circulated through canisters of lithium hydroxide (a base) to remove the carbon dioxide before it can reach dangerous levels.
2LiOH
(s)+CO2(g)→Li2CO3(aq)+H2O(/lscript)
Representing Aqueous Ionic Reactions with Net Ionic Equations
Mixing a solution that contains silver ions with a solution that contains
chloride ions produces a white precipitate of silver chloride. There musthave been other ions present in each solution, as well. You know thisbecause it is impossible to have a solution of just a cation or just an anion.Perhaps the solution that contained silver ions was prepared using silvernitrate or silver acetate. Similarly, the solution that contained chlorideions might have been prepared by dissolving NaCl in water, or perhaps
NH
4Clor another soluble chloride. Any solution that contains Ag+(aq)
will react with any other solution that contains Cl−(aq)to form a
precipitate of AgCl (s). The other ions in the solutions are not important
to the net result. These ions are like passive onlookers. They are calledspectator ions .
The reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride can be
represented by the following chemical equation:
AgNO
3(aq)+NaCl (aq)→NaNO 3(aq)+AgCl (s)
This equation does not show the change that occurs, however. It shows
the reactants and products as intact compounds. In reality, soluble ioniccompounds dissociate into their respective ions in solution. So chemistsoften use a total ionic equation to show the dissociated ions of the soluble
ionic compounds.
Ag
+(aq)+NO 3−(aq)+Na+(aq)+Cl−(aq)→Na+(aq)+NO 3−(aq)+AgCl (s)
Notice that the precipitate, AgCl, is still written as an ionic formula. This
makes sense because precipitates are insoluble, so they do not dissociateinto ions. Also notice that the spectator ions appear on both sides of theequation. Here is the total ionic equation again, with slashes through thespectator ions.
Ag
+(aq)+NO 3−(aq)+Na+(aq)+Cl−(aq)→Na+(aq)+NO 3−(aq)+AgCl (s)
If you eliminate the spectator ions, the equation becomes
Ag+(aq)+Cl−(aq)→AgCl (s)
342 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityAn ionic equation that is written this way, without the spectator ions, is
called a net ionic equation . Before you try writing your own net ionic
equations, examine the guidelines in Table 9.2 below.
Table 9.2 Guidelines for Writing a Net Ionic Equation
1.Include only ions and compounds that have reacted. Do not include
spectator ions.
2.Write the soluble ionic compounds as ions. For example, write
NH 4+(aq)and Cl−(aq), instead of NH 4Cl(aq).
3.Write insoluble ionic compounds as formulas, not ions. For example,
zinc sul ﬁde is insoluble, so you write it as ZnS (s), not Zn2+and S2−.
4.Since covalent compounds do not produce ions in aqueous solution,
write their molecular formulas. Water is a common example,because it dissociates only very slightly into ions. When a reactioninvolves a gas, always include the gas in the net ionic equation.
5.Write strong acids (discussed in the next chapter) in their ionicform. There are six strong acids:
•hydrochloric acid (write as H
+(aq)and Cl−(aq), not HCl (aq))
•hydrobromic acid (write as H+(aq)and Br−(aq))
•hydroiodic acid (write as H+(aq)and l−(aq))
•sulfuric acid (write as H+(aq)and SO4(aq))
•nitric acid (write as H+(aq)and NO 3−(aq))
•perchloric acid (write as H+(aq)and CIO 4−(aq))
All other acids are weak and form few ions. Therefore, write them
in their molecular form.
6.Finally, check that the net ionic equation is balanced for charges aswell as for atoms.

Step 1 Start by writing the chemical formulas of the given
compounds.
Step 2 Then write the complete chemical equation for the reaction,using your experience in predicting the formation of a precipitate.
Step 3 Once you have the chemical equation, you can replace thechemical formulas of the soluble ionic compounds with theirdissociated ions.
Step 4 This will give you the total ionic equation. Next you can identify the spectator ions (the ions that appear on both sidesof the equation).
Step 5 Finally, by rewriting the total ionic equation without the
spectator ions, you will have the net ionic equation.
Act on Your Strategy
Steps 1 and 2 The chemical equation for the reaction is
Na2S(aq)+FeSO 4(aq)→Na2SO4(aq)+FeS (s)
Step 3 The total ionic equation is
2Na+(aq)+S2−(aq)+Fe2+(aq)+SO42−(aq)→2Na+(aq)+SO42−(aq)+FeS (s)
Step 4 Therefore, the spectator ions are Na+(aq)and SO42−(aq).
Step 5 The net ionic equation is
Fe2+(aq)+S2−(aq)→FeS (s)

344 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityIdentifying Ions in Aqueous Solution
Suppose that you have a sample of water. You want to know what, if any,
ions are dissolved in it. Today technological devices, such as the massspectrometer, make this investigative work fairly simple. Before suchdevices, however, chemists relied on wet chemical techniques :
experimental tests, such as submitting a sample to a series of double displacement reactions. Chemists still use wet chemical techniques. With each reaction, insoluble compounds precipitate out of the solution.(See Figure 9.6.) This enables the chemist to determine, eventually, theidentity of one or several ions in the solution. This ion-identi ﬁcation
process is an example of qualitative analysis .
Chemists use a range of techniques for qualitative analysis. For exam-
ple, the colour of an aqueous solution can help to identify one of the ionsthat it contains. Examine Table 9.3. However, the intensity of ion colourvaries with its concentration in the solution. Also keep in mind that manyions are colourless in aqueous solution. For example, the cations of ele-ments from Groups 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA), as well as aluminum, zinc, andmost anions, are colourless. So there are limits to the inferences you canmake if you rely on solution colour alone.
Another qualitative analysis technique is a ﬂame test. A dissolved
ionic compound is placed in a ﬂame. Table 9.4 lists the ﬂame colours
associated with several ions. Notice that all the ions are metallic. Theﬂame test is only useful for identifying metallic ions in aqueous solution.
Qualitative analysis challenges a chemist ’s creative imagination and
chemical understanding. Discover this for yourself in Investigation 9-B.

Water, as you know, is the most abundant substance on Earth ’s surface.
Unfortunately there is more than enough water in some places, but notenough in others. As well, because water is used and re-used, and becauseit is such a powerful solvent, it is easily polluted.
Canada, with less than 1% of the world ’s population, has 22% of its
fresh water. So, in most regions of our country, the quality of water is
usually of greater concern than the quantity available. In this section, youwill examine factors that affect water quality. You will also study some ofthe reactions that make polluted water safe and ﬁt to drink.
Acceptable Concentrations of Substances in Drinking Water
The federal government assesses the health risks of speci ﬁc substances
in drinking water. Guidelines for acceptable concentrations of each sub-stance are then established in partnership with provincial and territorialgovernments. See Table 9.5. These governments require water suppliers to meet the guidelines. Corrective action may be taken when guidelinesare violated.

358 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityDrinking water guidelines
exist for microscopic organ-isms, such as bacteria andprotozoans, as well as forchemicals. These guidelineswere compromised in the townof Walkerton, Ontario, in 2000.Seven people died and about2000 people became ill as aresult of exposure to E. coli
bacteria that were present inthe town’s water supply. Themaximum acceptable concen-tration for E. coli bacteria is
zero organisms detectable in100 mL of drinking water. Toachieve this target, chlorine iscommonly used to kill E. coli
and other organisms in drink-ing water. Despite receivingtwo warnings from the Ministryof the Environment, the town’swater manager chose not toincrease the concentration ofchlorine in the water supply.As a result of this incident, theOntario government draftedlegislation to enforce strictadherence to water qualityquidelines.FACTCHEM Sources That Compromise Water Quality
Pure water does not exist in nature. All water naturally contains dissolved
substances or ions. For example, rainwater is naturally acidic. This isbecause water droplets dissolve atmospheric gases, such as carbon diox-ide, to form carbonic acid, H
2CO3. As water ﬁlters through soil and rock,
it tends to dissolve (leach) certain ions and compounds, such as Ca2+(aq),
Mg2+(aq), Fe2+(aq), Fe3+(aq), and SO42−(aq). In general, these substances pose
little or no threat to plants, animals, or you. In contrast, many of the substances listed in Table 9.5 may pose a threat. They result mainly fromhuman activities, such as manufacturing, food and materials processing,farming, and garbage disposal. The sources of these substances can beclassi ﬁed in the following three broad categories.
•Point Sources : A manufacturing or processing plant that discharges
untreated or insuf ﬁciently treated waste water into a river or lake is a
point source of pollution. Point sources include wrecked tankers thatleak oil and factories that discharge metallic ions, organic compounds,acids, and bases. Water itself can be a point source of thermal pollution,when thermal power plants discharge warm water into a lake from theircooling towers. Point sources can spread pollution over huge areas.
•Diffuse Sources : Pollution that comes from a wide range of sources,
not from a single source, is said to come from a diffuse source. (SeeFigure 9.7.) A heavy downpour can cause run-off from farm ﬁelds to
enter rivers and lakes. This run-off often carries undesirable pollutants,including fecal matter, pesticides, and fertilizer compounds, such asnitrates and phosphates.
•Indirect Sources : Air, water, and soil can become polluted from a
variety of indirect sources. Motor vehicles and factory smokestacksrelease gases that can indirectly cause many different types of pollution.The acidic gases that are produced (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides)dissolve and contribute to the formation of acid rain. The concentra-tions of ions in ground water are affected by how acidic the water is.For example, aluminum compounds are commonly found in soil. Acidicwater increases the leaching of aluminum ions into rivers and lakes.
Landﬁll leachate
is rainwater that has percolatedthrough land ﬁll wastes. It dis-
solves numerous compounds,many of them toxic. Modern land ﬁlls have containment and
treatment procedures to preventthis diffuse source of pollutionfrom contaminating ground water.Figure 9.7
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 359Treating Water for Your Home
If you live on a farm or in a remote area, you probably obtain your water
directly from a well on your property. If you live in an urban community,you probably obtain your water through a municipal or regional waterauthority. Before the water is made available to you, it is processed at awater treatment plant to remove pollutants. Lake, river, or reservoir water
enters the treatment plant, where a number of physical and chemicalprocesses take place. Figure 9.8 summarizes these processes.

The following processes take place at a water treatment plant. These
processes must ensure that the water meets all the allowable concentrations.Figure 9.8A coarse screen made of metal bars ﬁlters large particles and trash such as bottles and cans.
Chlorine is added to kill bacteria and viruses. It also helps to remove dissolved hydrogen sul ﬁde:
H2S(aq)+4Cl 2(aq)+4H2O(l)→8Cl−(aq)+SO 42−(aq)+10H+(aq)
A process called ﬂocculation removes suspended particles such as clay and microorganisms. Lime (CaO)
and aluminum sulfate ( Al2(SO 4)3) are added. They react together to form aluminum hydroxide:
3CaO (s)+3H2O(l)+Al2(SO 4)3(s)→2Al(OH) 3(s)+3Ca2+(aq)+3SO 42−(aq)
Aluminum hydroxide is a sticky gel that traps the ﬁnely suspended particles. Lime is a basic oxide, so it
decreases the acidity of the water, and it precipitates some calcium carbonate. The aluminum hydroxidewith its trapped particles settles to the bottom of the tank.
The water is passed through a bed of graded gravel and sand in a ﬁltering tank.
Water is often saturated with oxygen by spraying it into the air, which helps to remove volatile organic
compounds and improves the taste and odour.
The water receives a second treatment with chlorine to kill bacteria. Ammonia is added to make the
chlorine last longer in the piping. Some municipalities add compounds such as sodium ﬂuoride. 654321
360 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityHard Water and Soft Water
The water that ﬂows through your faucet has been treated to remove,
or limit, a large number of pollutants. It is far from pure, however. Forexample, it still contains dissolved ions, such as Ca
2+(aq), Mg2+(aq), Fe2+(aq),
Fe3+(aq), and SO42−(aq). These ions, especially calcium and magnesium,
make it dif ﬁcult to form lather with soap. Water with high concentrations
of these ions is called hard water , partly because it is “hard ” to lather.
Water with relatively low concentrations of these ions lathers well. It iscalled soft water .
Ground water is usually harder than surface water in the same region.
The extent of the hardness depends on the types of rocks through whichthe water ﬂows. It also depends on the length of time that the water is
in contact with the rocks. The Rocky Mountains, the Canadian Shield,and most of the Maritimes have very insoluble bedrock. Thus, the water in these regions is usually soft. The sedimentary rocks of the NiagaraPeninsula and the Prairies are more soluble, resulting in water that rangesfrom moderately hard to very hard.
The most common type of rock to cause hard water is limestone
(calcium carbonate). Limestone is usually considered insoluble. The smallamount that does dissolve forms low concentrations of important ions.
CaCO
3(s)+H2O(/lscript)→Ca2+(aq)+HCO−3(aq)+OH−(aq)
When the water contains dissolved acids (often H2CO3from rainwater),
the H+
(aq)ion increases the concentrations of calcium and hydrogen
carbonate ions.
CaCO 3(s)+H+(aq)→Ca2+(aq)+HCO3−(aq)
Hydrogen carbonate ions can be economically costly. Solutions that
contain these ions decompose when heated to form carbonates.
2HCO 3−(aq)→H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)+CO32−(aq)
The carbonate ions recombine with calcium ions to form calcium carbon-
ate deposits. These deposits form a coating on heating elements in kettlesand boilers, and build up inside hot water pipes. The coating is com-monly called boiler scale. (See Figure 9.9.) It not only reduces the ﬂow
of water in pipes, but it also increases the cost of heating the water.
A simple way to remove boiler scale from the inside of a kettle or
a coffee maker is to add vinegar. Acetic acid in vinegar reacts with calcium (and magnesium) carbonates to form soluble salts. (Rememberthat all acetates are soluble.)
CaCO
3(s)+2CH 3COOH (aq)→Ca2+(aq)+2CH 3COO−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)+CO2(g)
Why is hard water so hard to
lather? Ordinary soap is oftensodium stearate, NaC
17H35O2.
Sodium stearate consists ofthe sodium salt of a compoundthat contains many carbonatoms. The calcium ions inhard water displace the sodium ions, and the new salts are insoluble:
Ca
2+(aq)+2NaC 17H35O2(aq)→
Ca(C 17H35O2)2(s)+2Na+(aq)
As a result, the effectiveness
of the soap is reduced. Theinsoluble salts form a scum on clothing and a grey slimydeposit in sinks and bathtubs:“bathtub ring.”FACTCHEM
This photomicro-
graph shows the crystallinestructure of precipitated boiler scale.Figure 9.9
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 361Treating Water at Home
The ions that cause hard water are not a health hazard but they can be
a nuisance. They are not always removed at municipal treatment plants. If you wish, you can remove some of these ions (mainly Ca
2+(aq), Mg2+(aq),
and Fe2+(aq)) yourself. For relatively small volumes of water (such as
enough to ﬁll a bathtub or a washing machine), you can add sodium
carbonate decahydrate, Na2CO3·10H 2O. This compound is commonly
called washing soda. It is an inexpensive way to add carbonate ion to thewater. The carbonate ions precipitate the unwanted ions.
Ca
2+(aq)+CO32−
(aq)→CaCO 3(s)
The sodium ions in the washing soda behave as spectator ions, leaving
the water soft.
For the large volume of water needed on a daily basis, people often
install an ion exchange water softener. This apparatus exchanges one
kind of ion for another. (See Figure 9.10.) The hard water passes through acolumn that is packed with beads. The beads are made from an insolubleplastic material and are coated with sodium salts, often NaCl. (The salt-coated beads are referred to as an ion exchange resin.) As the hard waterpasses through the column, the ions in the water displace the sodium ions on the resin. After most of the sodium ions have been exchanged forcalcium ions (and other hardness-causing ions), the resin is regenerated.This is done by passing a very concentrated solution of sodium chloride(brine) through the column. The calcium ions are ﬂushed out of the
system, along with excess sodium chloride solution.

362 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityWaste-Water Treatment
The treatment of waste water (sewage) is often divided into three types:
primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. (See Figure 9.11.)
•Primary treatment mainly involves removing solids from waste water
physically, using ﬁlters and settling tanks.
•Secondary treatment involves using bacteria to chemically decompose
dissolved and suspended organic compounds.
•Tertiary treatment involves chemical treatments to remove the majority
of remaining ions and disease-causing micro-organisms.

The main steps involved in the treatment of waste water: Municipalities
may use one, two, or all three treatment methods, depending on their needs and ﬁnances.Figure 9.11Primary Treatment
Screens remove larger solids.
As waste water slowly passes through a grit tank, smaller particles (such as gravel, sand, and food wastes)
settle out.
In a sedimentation tank, ﬁner-sized particles settle out slowly to form sludge.
Sludge, oils, and grease from the sedimentation tank move to a sludge-digesting tank. There they are
chemically decomposed ( “digested ”) by anaerobic bacteria.
Secondary Treatment
Bacterial decomposition of dissolved organic matter takes place in trickling ﬁlter tanks and activated
sludge tanks.
Tertiary Treatment
The resulting waste water may be returned to waterways or used by industries or for irrigation. Processes
such as precipitation and ﬁltration remove most remaining pollutants. Treatment with chlorine or ozone
kills most of the disease-causing micro-organisms. The resulting water is safe for most purposes, but not for drinking.654321
Chapter 9  Aqueous Solutions • MHR 363Water is hard if it contains high concentrations of
calcium and magnesium ions, Ca2+and Mg2+. If
these ions are present in lower concentrations,the water is considered to be soft. Distilled waterhas few ions of any kind, and no Ca
2+or Mg2+.
Sodium oxalate, Na2C2O4, is a compound that
causes Ca2+to precipitate as calcium oxalate,
CaC 2O4, and Mg2+to precipitate as magnesium
oxalate, MgC 2O4.
Procedure
1.A student added 1 mL of hard water to one
test tube, 1 mL of soft water to another, and 1 mL of distilled water to a third. The hardwater sample contained Ca
2+and Mg2+. The
soft water contained lower concentrations ofthese ions.2.Into each test tube, the student put two drops of 0.1 mol/L sodium oxalate solution.Then the student mixed the contents.
Analysis
1.Infer what the student observed in each testtube. Write a net ionic equation if you predictthat a precipitate formed. Write “NR” if you
think that no reaction occurred.
2.Imagine that you have the three water sam-ples the student used, but no sodium oxalatesolution. How else could you test the validityof your predictions?
3.With your teacher ’s permission, test your
predictions. Sodium oxalate is poisonous. Wear an apron and safety goggles.Handle all the solutions carefully.CAUTIONTesting Hard Water and Soft Water Thought Lab

Dr. Jiangning Wu:
Cleaning the World ’s Water
Around the world, researchers are working to
reduce the pollutants in our lakes, rivers, andground water. Both industry and agriculture toooften produce waste water that contains every-thing from animal droppings and excess fertilizerto arti ﬁcial colours and other chemicals. Yet,
without industry and agriculture, we would nothave many of the modern comforts we expectand enjoy.
Jiangning Wu was born and raised in
Nanjing, China. She came to Canada to completeher studies in chemical engineering at theUniversity of Windsor. After earning her doctoratein 1992, she turned her attention to the use ofenzymes for purifying waste water.Enzymes are naturally occurring substances
that speed up chemical reactions without beingused up or changed by the reactions. They arebasic to living organisms. Thus it is no surprisethat they are well-suited to removing organic pollutants from waste water. For instance, anenzyme that is found in horseradish helps toaccelerate the oxidation of soluble organic pollu-tants known as phenols. The resulting com-pounds are less soluble and more easily removedfrom the waste water.
In 1993, Dr. Wu found that, with a single
additive, the same enzyme was able to removephenols from waste water. Her strategy workedeven for the low concentrations of phenols typical of industrial waste water. Moreover, signi ﬁcantly lower concentrations of the enzyme
were needed! Dr. Wu ’s discovery brought
researchers one step closer to a commercialprocess, which would mean cleaner waters andless stress on the environment.
Dr. Wu is a professor in the School of
Chemical Engineering at Ryerson PolytechnicalUniversity in Toronto. She is currently investigat-ing the use of ozone for waste-water treatmentand food preservation.

In this section, you applied your understanding of aqueous solutions to
explore the chemistry of water quality. Some of the chemicals you considered belong to a group of compounds that are called acids andbases. In the next chapter, you will investigate the properties and chemi-cal behaviour of these important compounds.
In what ways can water in the environment become polluted?
Give at least two examples for each.
Which chemical in Table 9.5 has the lowest acceptable
concentration? Which chemical has the highest acceptable concentra-tion? Rearrange the chemicals in the table so they are organized byconcentration, from lowest to highest, rather than alphabetically byname.
What is the source of the water you use at home? Based on your
experience with this water, which ions do you think it contains?Explain your answer.
Use a graphic organizer to outline the main steps involved in
treating drinking water and waste water.
An alternative to ion exchange water softening is a process called
reverse osmosis . Use your knowledge of osmosis to infer, in general
terms, how this method might work. Consult print or electronicresources to modify or expand on your ideas. Then use suitable software to communicate your ﬁndings as a graphic organizer or a

Chlorine was ﬁrst used to
disinfect water in Britain in1904, after a typhoid epidemic.(Typhoid is a water-borne, con-tagious illness that is causedby a species of Salmonella
bacteria.) Strict limits are necessary because chlorine isineffective when its concentra-tion is less than 0.1 mg/L. Itgives water an unpleasanttaste at concentrations above1.0 mg/L. Chlorine has a disad-vantage, however. It can reactwith other chemicals in thewater to form poisonous com-pounds, such as chloroform,

W hat do cheese, stomach juices, baking soda, oven cleaner, and under-
arm odour have in common? They are all acidic or basic. Do you knowwhich are acidic and which are basic?
Acids and bases are very important chemicals. They have been used
for thousands of years. Vinegar is an acidic solution that is common inmany food and cleaning products. It was discovered long ago—before people invented the skill of writing to record its use. Today, acids are alsoused to manufacture fertilizers, explosives, plastics, motor vehicles, andcomputer circuit boards.
Like acids, bases have numerous uses in the home and in chemical
industries. Nearly 5000 years ago, in the Middle East, the Babyloniansmade soap using the bases in wood ash. Today, one of Canada’s mostimportant industries, the pulp and paper industry, uses huge quantities of a base called sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is also used tomanufacture soaps, detergents, dyes, and many other compounds.
In this chapter, you will learn about the properties of acids and bases.
You will learn how these properties change when acids and bases reacttogether. As well, you will have a chance to estimate and measure theacidity of aqueous solutions.

Specific Expectations  As you can see in Table 10.1, acids and bases are common products in the
home. It is easy to identify some products as acids. Often the word “acid”appears in the list of ingredients. Identifying bases is more difﬁcult. Acidsand bases have different properties, however, that enable you to distin-guish between them.
Table 10.1 Common Acids and Bases in the Home
Properties of Acids and Bases
One way to distinguish acids from bases is to describe their observable
properties. For example, acids taste sour, and they change colour whenmixed with coloured dyes called indicators. Bases taste bitter and feelslippery. They also change colour when mixed with indicators.
Another property that can be used to distinguish acids from bases is
their conductivity in solution. As you can see in Figure 10.1, aqueoussolutions of acids and bases conduct electricity. This is evidence that ionsare present in acidic and basic solutions. Some of these solutions, such ashydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (a base), cause the bulb to glow brightly. Most acidic and basic solutions, however, cause the bulb to glow dimly.You should never taste or touch acids, bases, or any other
chemicals. Early chemists used their senses of taste and touch toobserve the properties of many chemicals. This dangerous practiceoften led to serious injury, and sometimes death.Acids

CAUTIONThe word “acid” comes from

“sour tasting.” As you willlearn in this chapter, bases are the “base” (the foundation)from which many other com-pounds form. A base that issoluble in water is called analkali. The word “alkali” comesfrom an Arabic word meaning“ashes of a plant.” In theancient Middle East, peoplerinsed plant ashes with hotwater to obtain a basic solution. The basic solutionwas then reacted with animalfats to make soap. LanguageLINK
Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 371Table 10.2 on the next page summarizes the observable properties of acids
and bases. These observable properties include their physical characteris-tics and their chemical behaviour. The Express Lab on page xxx providesyou with an opportunity to compare some of these properties. What areacids and bases, however? How does chemical composition determinewhether a substance is acidic or basic? You will consider one possibleanswer to this question starting on page 373.An oxide is a compound of oxy-
gen with a metal or non-metal.Most metal oxides react withwater to form basic solutions.For example, calcium oxide is ametal oxide that is important inthe construction industry as aningredient of cement. Calciumoxide reacts with water to forma basic solution of calciumhydroxide.
CaO
(s)+H2O(/lscript)→Ca(OH) 2(aq)
Many municipal water treat-
ment plants use calciumhydroxide to soften very hardwater before releasing it forpublic use. Most non-metaloxides react with water to formacidic solutions. For example,sulfur dioxide gas dissolves inwater to form sulfurous acid.
SO
2(g)+H2O(/lscript)→H2SO3(aq)
The metallic character of the
elements in the periodic table,and the acid-base propertiesof their oxides, show a distincttrend across periods and downgroups. Infer what this trend is.In other words, state what youthink happens to the acid-baseproperties of oxides as you goacross a period and down agroup. Make a quick sketch ofthe periodic table to illustratethis trend. How would youdescribe the acid-base proper-ties of the metalloids? (Useyour knowledge of the physicalproperties of the metalloids tohelp you make your inference.)

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 373The Arrhenius Theory of Acids and Bases
In Figure 10.1, you saw evidence that ions are present in solutions of
acids and bases. When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water, for example,it dissociates (breaks apart) into hydrogen ions and chloride ions.
HCl
(aq)→H+(aq)+Cl−(aq)
When sodium hydroxide dissolves in water, it dissociates to form sodium
ions and hydroxide ions.
NaOH (aq)→Na+(aq)+OH−(aq)
The dissociations of other acids and bases in water reveal a pattern. This
pattern was ﬁrst noticed in the late nineteenth century by a Swedish
chemist named Svant é Arrhenius. (See Figure 10.2.)
HBr (aq)→H+(aq)+Br−(aq)
H2SO4(aq)→H+(aq)+HSO−4(aq)

374 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityIn 1887, Arrhenius published a theory to explain the nature of acids
and bases. It is called the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases .
According to the Arrhenius theory, acids increase the concentration of H+
in aqueous solutions. Thus, an Arrhenius acid must contain hydrogen as
the source of H+. You can see this in the dissociation reactions for acids
on the previous page.
Bases, on the other hand, increase the concentration of OH−in aque-
ous solutions. An Arrhenius base must contain the hydroxyl group, —OH,
as the source of OH−. You can see this in the dissociation reactions for
bases on the previous page.
Limitations of the Arrhenius Theory
The Arrhenius theory is useful if you are interested in the ions that resultwhen an acid or a base dissociates in water. It also helps explain whathappens when an acid and a base undergo a neutralization reaction. Insuch a reaction, an acid combines with a base to form an ionic compoundand water. Examine the following reactions:
HCl
(aq)+NaOH (aq)→NaCl (aq)+H2O(/lscript)
The net ionic equation for this reaction shows the principal ions in the
Arrhenius theory.
H+(aq)+OH−(aq)→H2O(/lscript)
Since acids and bases produce hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, water
is an inevitable result of acid-base reactions.
Problems arise with the Arrhenius theory, however. One problem
involves the ion that is responsible for acidity: H+. Look again at the equa-
tion for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid.
HCl (aq)→H+(aq)+Cl−(aq)
This dissociation occurs in aqueous solution, but chemists often leave out
H2Oas a component of the reaction. They simply assume that it is there.
What happens if you put H2Ointo the equation?
HCl (aq)+H2O(/lscript)→H+(aq)+Cl−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)
Notice that the water is unchanged when the reaction is represented
this way. However, you learned earlier that water is a polar molecule. The O atom has a partial negative charge, and the H atoms have partialpositive charges. Thus, H
2Omust interact in some way with the ions H+
and Cl−. In fact, chemists made a discovery in the early twentieth century.
They realized that protons do not exist in isolation in aqueous solution.(The hydrogen ion is simply a proton. It is a positively charged nuclearparticle.) Instead, protons are always hydrated : they are attached to
water molecules. A hydrated proton is called a hydronium ion, H
3O+(aq).

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 375There is another problem with the Arrhenius theory. Consider the
reaction of ammonia, NH 3, with water.
NH 3(g)+H2O(/lscript)→NH+4(aq)+OH−(aq)
Ammonia is one of several substances that produce basic solutions
in water. As you can see, ammonia does not contain hydroxide ions. However, it does produce these ions when it reacts with water. Ammoniaalso undergoes a neutralization reaction with acids. The Arrhenius theorycannot explain the basic properties of ammonia. Nor can it explain thefact that certain other substances, such as salts that contain carbonateions, also have basic properties.
There is yet another problem with the Arrhenius theory. It is limited
to acid-base reactions in a single solvent, water. Many acid-base reactionstake place in other solvents, however.
The Brønsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases
In 1923, two chemists working independently of each other, proposed anew theory of acids and bases. (See Figure 10.4.) Johannes Br ønsted in
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Thomas Lowry in London, England, proposedwhat is called the Brønsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases. This theory
overcame the problems related to the Arrhenius theory.
The Brønsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases
•An acid is a substance from which a proton ( H+ion) can be
removed.
•A base is a substance that can remove a proton ( H+ion) from
an acid.

+(H2O)n, where nis

Johannes Brønsted
(1879–1947), left, and ThomasLowry (1874–1936), right. Brønstedpublished many more articlesabout ions in solution than Lowry did. Thus, some chemistryresources refer to the “Brønstedtheory of acids and bases.”Figure 10.4
376 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityLike an Arrhenius acid, a Br ønsted-Lowry acid must contain H in its
formula. This means that all Arrhenius acids are also Br ønsted-Lowry
acids. However, any negative ion (not just OH−) can be a Br ønsted-Lowry
base. In addition, water is not the only solvent that can be used.
According to the Br ønsted-Lowry theory, there is only one require-
ment for an acid-base reaction. One substance must provide a proton, andanother substance must receive the same proton. In other words, an acid-
base reaction involves the transfer of a proton.
The idea of proton transfer has major implications for understanding
the nature of acids and bases. According to the Br ønsted-Lowry theory,
any substance can behave as an acid, but only if another substancebehaves as a base at the same time. Similarly, any substance can behave asa base, but only if another substance behaves as an acid at the same time.
For example, consider the reaction between hydrochloric acid and
water shown in Figure 10.5. In this reaction, hydrochloric acid is an acidbecause it provides a proton ( H
+) to the water. The water molecule
receives the proton. Therefore, according to the Br ønsted-Lowry theory,
water is a base in this reaction. When the water receives the proton, itbecomes a hydronium ion ( H
3O+). Notice the hydronium ion on the right
side of the equation.
The reaction between hydrochloric acid and water, according to the
Brønsted-Lowry theory
Two molecules or ions that are related by the transfer of a proton are
called a conjugate acid-base pair. (Conjugate means "linked together.")
The conjugate base of an acid is the particle that remains when a proton
is removed from the acid. The conjugate acid of a base is the particle that
results when the base receives the proton from the acid. In the reactionbetween hydrochloric acid and water, the hydronium ion is the conjugateacid of the base, water. The chloride ion is the conjugate base of the acid,hydrochloric acid.
According to the Br ønsted-Lowry theory, every acid has a conjugate
base, and every base has a conjugate acid. The conjugate base and conju-gate acid of an acid-base pair are linked by the transfer of a proton. Theconjugate base of the acid-base pair has one less hydrogen than the acid. Italso has one more negative charge than the acid. The conjugate acid of theacid-base pair has one more hydrogen than the base. It also has one lessnegative charge than the base.
These ideas about acid-base reactions and conjugate acid-base pairs
will become clearer as you study the following Sample Problems andPractice Problems.Figure 10.5→proton transfer

explain the chemical nature of acids and bases. Table 10.3 summarizes thekey points of these theories.
In both the Arrhenius theory and the Br ønsted-Lowry theory, acids
and bases form ions in solution. Many characteristics of acid-base behav-iour are linked to the number of ions that form from a particular acid orbase. One of these characteristics is strength.
In section 10.2, you will learn why a dilute solution of vinegar is safe

hydrochloric acid and acetic acid. The conductivity tester is testing thesame concentrations of both acids. As you can see, the bulb glows brightlyin the hydrochloric acid. The bulb glows dimly in the acetic acid. Howcan these different results be explained?
Strong Acids and Weak Acids
You know that ions are present in an aqueous solution of an acid. Theseions result from the dissociation of the acid. An acid that dissociates completely into ions in water is called a strong acid. For example,
hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. Allthe molecules of hydrochloric acid
in an aqueous solution dissociate into H
+and Cl−ions. The H+ions, as
you know, bond with surrounding water molecules to form hydroniumions, H
3O+. (See Figure 10.6.) The concentration of hydronium ions in a
dilute solution of a strong acid is equal to the concentration of the acid.Thus, a 1.0 mol/L solution of hydrochloric acid contains 1.0 mol/L ofhydronium ions. Table 10.4 lists the strong acids.
When hydrogen chloride molecules enter an aqueous solution, 100% of the
hydrogen chloride molecules dissociate. As a result, the solution contains the same per-cent of H
+ions (in the form of H3O+) and Cl−ions: 100%.
A weak acid is an acid that dissociates very slightly in a water solu-
tion. Thus, only a small percentage of the acid molecules break apart intoions. Most of the acid molecules remain intact. For example, acetic acid isa weak acid. On average, only about 1% (one in a hundred) of the aceticacid molecules dissociate at any given moment in a 0.1 mol/L solution.(The number of acid molecules that dissociate depends on the concentra-tion and temperature of the solution.) In fact, the concentration of
hydronium ions in a solution of a weak acid is always less than the concentration of the dissolved acid. (See Figure 10.7.)Figure 10.6

382 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityWhen acetic acid molecules enter an aqueous solution, only about 1% of
them dissociate. Thus, the number of acetic acid molecules in solution is far greater thanthe number of hydronium ions and acetate ions.
Notice the arrow that is used in the equation in Figure 10.7. It points in
both directions, indicating that the reaction is reversible. In other words,
the products of the reaction also react to produce the original reactants. Inthis reaction, molecules of acetic acid dissociate just as quickly and asoften as the dissociated ions re-associate to produce acetic acid molecules.(Figure 10.8 will help you visualize what happens.)
Most acids are weak acids. Whenever you see a reversible chemical
equation involving an acid, you can safely assume that the acid is weak.
When acetic acid dissolves in water, acetic acid molecules dissociate
and re-associate at the same time and at the same rate.
A few acids contain only a single hydrogen ion that can dissociate.
These acids are called monoprotic acids. (The pre ﬁx mono- means “one.”
The root -protic refers to “proton. ”) Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
and hydroiodic acid are strong monoprotic acids. Hydro ﬂuoric acid, HF, is
weak monoprotic acid.
Many acids contain two or more hydrogen ions that can dissociate.
For example, sulfuric acid, H2SO4(aq), has two hydrogen ions that can dis-
sociate. As you know from Table 10.4, sulfuric acid is a strong acid. Thisis true only for its ﬁrst dissociation, however.
H
2SO4(aq)→H+(aq)+HSO 4−(aq)
The resulting aqueous hydrogen sulfate ion, HSO−4, is a weak acid. It dis-

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 383Thus, acids that contain two hydrogen ions dissociate to form two anions.
These acids are sometimes called diprotic acids. (The pre ﬁx di-, as you
know, means “two.”) The acid that is formed by the ﬁrst dissociation is
stronger than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation.
Acids that contain three hydrogen ions are called triprotic acids.
Phosphoric acid, H3PO4(aq), is a triprotic acid. It gives rise to three anions,
as follows:
H3PO4(aq)+H2O(/lscript)H+(aq)+H2PO4−(aq)
H2PO4−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)H+(aq)+HPO 42−(aq)
HPO 42−(aq)+H2O(/lscript)H+(aq)+PO43−(aq)
Here again, the acid that is formed by the ﬁrst dissociation is stronger
than the acid that is formed by the second dissociation. This acid isstronger than the acid that is formed by the third dissociation. Keep inmind, however, that all three of these acids are weak because only a smallproportion of them dissociates.
Strong Bases and Weak Bases
Like a strong acid, a strong base dissociates completely into ions in water.
All oxides and hydroxides of the alkali metals —Group 1 (IA) —are strong
bases. The oxides and hydroxides of the alkaline earth metals —Group 2
(IIA) —below beryllium are also strong bases.
Recall that the concentration of hydronium ions in a dilute solution of
a strong acid is equal to the concentration of the acid. Similarly, the con-centration of hydroxide ions in a dilute solution of a strong base is equalto the concentration of the base. For example, a 1.0 mol/L solution ofsodium hydroxide (a strong base) contains 1.0 mol/L of hydroxide ions.
Table 10.5 lists some common strong bases. Barium hydroxide,
Ba(OH)
2, and strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH) 2, are strong bases that are
soluble in water. Magnesium oxide, MgO, and magnesium hydroxide,
Mg(OH) 2, are also strong bases, but they are considered to be insoluble.
A small amount of these compounds does dissolve in water, however.Virtually all of this small amount dissociates completely.
Most bases are weak. A weak base dissociates very slightly in a
water solution. The most common weak base is aqueous ammonia. In a0.1 mol/L solution, only about 1% of the ammonia molecules react withwater to form hydroxide ions. This reversible reaction is represented inFigure 10.9.
Ammonia does not contain hydroxide ions, so it is not an Arrhenius base.
As you can see, however, an ammonia molecule can remove a proton from water, leavinga hydroxide ion behind. Thus, ammonia is a Br ønsted-Lowry weak base.Figure 10.9

384 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityNaming Acids and Their Anions
There are two main kinds of acids: binary acids and oxoacids. A binary
acid is composed of two elements: hydrogen and a non-metal. Two exam-
ples of binary acids are hydro ﬂuoric acid and hydrochloric acid. All bina-
ry acids have the general formula HX (aq). The H represents one or more
hydrogen atoms. The X represents the non-metal. As you can see in Table10.6, the names of binary acids are made up of the following parts:•the pre ﬁx hydro-
•a root that is formed from the name of the non-metal
•the suf ﬁx -ic
•the word “acid” at the end
Table 10.6 Examples of Naming Binary Acids
As you know, anions are formed when binary acids dissociate. The
names of these anions end in the suf ﬁx -ide. For example, hydro ﬂouric
acid forms the anion ﬂuoride, F
−. Hydrochloric acid forms the anion
chloride, Cl−.
An oxoacid is an acid formed from a polyatomic ion that contains
oxygen, hydrogen, and another element. (Oxoacids are called oxyacids insome chemistry textbooks). In Chapter 3, you learned the names of com-mon polyatomic ions and their valences (oxidation numbers). The namesof oxoacids are similar to the names of their polyatomic oxoanions. Onlythe suf ﬁx is different. Study the three rules and examples for naming
oxoacids below. Then try the Practice Problems that follow.
1.For anions that end in -ate, the suf ﬁx of the acid is -ic. For example,
the acid of the chlorate anion ClO 3−, is chloric acid, HClO 3.
2.For anions that end in -ite, the suf ﬁx of the acid is -ous. For example,
the acid of the chlorite anion, ClO 2−, is chlorous acid, HClO 2.
3.The pre ﬁxes hypo- and per- remain as part of the acid name. For exam-
ple, the acid of the perchlorate anion, ClO 4−, is perchloric acid, HClO 4.
The acid of the hypochlorite anion, ClO−, is hypochlorous acid, HClO.Binary acid Prefix

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 385Describing Acid and Base Strength Quantitatively: pH
You are probably familiar with the term “pH” from a variety of sources.
Advertisers talk about the “pH balance ” of products such as soaps, sham-
poos, and skin creams. People who own aquariums and swimming poolsmust monitor the pH of the water. (See Figure 10.10.) Gardeners and farm-ers use simple tests to determine the pH of the soil. They know that plantsand food crops grow best within a narrow range of pH. Similarly, the pHof your blood must remain within narrow limits for you to stay healthy.
pH is clearly related to health, and to the proper functioning of products
and systems. (Notice that the “p” is always lower case, even at the start
of a sentence.) What exactly is pH? How is it measured? To answer thesequestions, consider a familiar substance: water.
The Power of Hydrogen in Water
As you know, all aqueous solutions contain ions. Even pure water con-tains a few ions that are produced by the dissociation of water molecules.Remember: The double arrow in the equation shows that the reaction is
reversible. The ions recombine to form water molecules.
H

(aq)
On average, at 25 °C, only about two water molecules in a billion are
dissociated at any given moment. As you know, it is the ions in solutionthat conduct electricity. If there are virtually no ions, no electricity is conducted. This is why pure water is such a poor conductor. Chemistshave determined that the concentration of hydronium ions in neutralwater, at 25 ˚C, is only 1.0×10
−7mol/L. The dissociation of water also
produces the same, very small number of hydroxide ions. Therefore, theconcentration of hydroxide ions is also 1.0×10
−7mol/L.
Chemists sometimes use square brackets around a chemical formula.
This shorthand notation means “the concentration of ” the chemical inside
the brackets. For example, [ H3O+] is read as “the concentration of hydro-
nium ions. ” Thus, the concentration of hydronium ions and hydroxide
ions in neutral water can be written as
[H3O+]=[OH−]=1.0×10–7mol/L
the concentration of hydroxide ionsthe concentration of hydronium ions
Maintaining a
safe environment for an aquariumor a swimming pool requiresmeasuring the pH of the waterand knowing how to adjust it.Figure 10.10
386 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityCompared with neutral water, acidic solutions contain a higher con-
centration of hydronium ions. Basic solutions contain a lower concentra-tion of hydronium ions. Therefore, the dissociation of water providesanother way of thinking about acids and bases. An acid is any compound
that increases [ H
3O+] when it is dissolved in water. A base is any com-
pound that increases [ OH−] when it is dissolved in water. (See Figure

The relationship between the concentrations of hydronium ions and
hydroxide ions in a solution determines whether the solution is acidic, basic, or neutral.
The pH Scale: Measuring by Powers of Ten
The concentration of hydronium ions ranges from about 10 mol/L for a
concentrated strong acid to about 10−15mol/L for a concentrated strong
base. This wide range of concentrations, and the negative powers of 10,are not very convenient to work with. In 1909, a Danish biochemist, S øren
Sørensen, suggested a method for converting concentrations to positive
numbers. His method involved using the numerical system of logarithms.
The logarithm of a number is the power to which you must raise 10 to
equal that number. For example, the logarithm of 10 is 1, because
10
1=10. The logarithm of 100 is 2, because 102=100. (See Appendix E
for more information about exponents and logarithms.)
Sørensen de ﬁned pHas −log [H+]. Since S ørensen did not know about
hydronium ions, his de ﬁnition of pH is based on Arrhenius ’ hydrogen
ion. Many chemistry references reinterpret the H so that it refers to theBrønsted-Lowry hydronium ion, H
3O+, instead. This textbook adopts the
hydronium ion usage. Thus, the de ﬁnition for pH becomes
pH=−log [H 3O+]. Recall, though, that chemists use [H+]as a shorthand
notation for [H3O+]. As a result, both equations give the same product.
As you can see in Figure 10.12, the “p” in pH stands for the word
“power. ” The power referred to is exponential power: the power of 10.
The “H” stands for the concentration of hydrogen ions (or H3O+ions),
measured in mol/L.

The concept
of pH makes working with very small values, such as 0.000 000 000 000 01, much easier.Figure 10.12
Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 387The concept of pH allows hydronium (or hydrogen) ion concentra-
tions to be expressed as positive numbers, rather than negative exponents.For example, recall that [ H
3O+] of neutral water at 25 ˚C is 1.0×10−7.
∴pH=−log [H 3O+]
=−log (1.0×10−7)
=−(−7.00)
=7.00
[H3O+] in acidic solutions is greater than [ H3O+] in neutral water. For
example, if [ H3O+] in an acid is 1.0×10−4mol/L , this is 1000 times greater
than [ H3O+] in neutral water. Use Table 10.7 to make sure that you under-
stand why. The pH of the acid is 4.00. All acidic solutions have a pH thatis less than 7.
Table 10.7 Understanding pH
[H
3O+] in basic solutions is less than [ H3O+] in pure water. For exam-
ple, if [ H3O+] in a base is 1.0×10−11mol/L , this is 10 000 times less than
[H3O+] in neutral water. The pH of the base is 11.00. All basic solutions
have a pH that is greater than 7.
The relationship among pH, [ H3O+], and the strength of acids and
bases is summarized in the Concept Connection on the next page. Use thefollowing Sample Problem and Practice Problems to assess your under-standing of this relationship.

How do you determine the
number of signi ﬁcant digits in a
pH? You count only the digits tothe right of the decimal point.For example, suppose that theconcentration of hydroniumions in a sample of orangejuice is 2.5×10
−4mol/L . This
number has two signi ﬁcant
digits: the 2 and the 5. Thepower of 10 only tells us whereto place the decimal: 0.000 25.The pH of the sample is
−log ( 2.5×10
−4)=3.602 059 .
The digit to the left of the deci-mal (the 3) is derived from thepower of 10. Therefore, it is notconsidered to be a signi ﬁcant
digit. Only the two digits to theright of the decimal are signi ﬁcant. Thus, the pH value
is rounded off to 3.60.
Identify the signi ﬁcant digits in
each pH value below.

The Chemistry of Oven Cleaning
Oven cleaning is not a job that most people
enjoy. Removing baked-on grease from insidean oven requires serious scrubbing. Any chemi-cal oven cleaners that help to make the job easier are usually welcome. Like all chemicals,however, the most effective oven cleanersrequire attention to safety.
Cleaners that contain strong bases are the
most effective for dissolving grease and grime.Bases are effective because they produce soapswhen they react with the fatty acids in grease.When a strong base (such as sodium hydroxide,NaOH, or potassium hydroxide, KOH) is used ona dirty oven, the fat molecules that make up thegrease are split into smaller molecules. Anionsfrom the base then bond with some of thesemolecules to form soap.
One end of a soap molecule is non-polar
(uncharged), so it is soluble in dirt and grease,which are also non-polar. The other end of asoap molecule is polar (charged), so it is solublein water. Because of its two different properties,soap acts like a “bridge ” between the grease
and the water. Soap enables grease to dissolvein water and be washed away, thus allowing the cleaner to remove the grease from the oven surface.Cleaners that contain sodium hydroxide and
potassium hydroxide are very effective. Theyare also caustic and potentially very dangerous.For example, sodium hydroxide, in the concen-trations that are used in oven cleaners, can irritate the skin and cause blindness if it gets in the eyes. As well, it is damaging to paints and fabrics.
There are alternatives to sodium hydroxide
and other strong base cleaners. One alternativeinvolves using ammonia, NH
3, which is a weak
base. If a bowl of dilute ammonia solution isplaced in an oven and left for several hours,most of the grease and grime can be wiped off.
Ammonia does not completely ionize in
water. Only a small portion dissociates.Although an ammonia solution is less causticthan sodium hydroxide, it can be toxic if inhaleddirectly. As well, ammonia vapours can causeeye, lung, and skin irritations. At higher concen-trations, ammonia can be extremely toxic.
Baking soda is a non-toxic alternative, but it
is much less effective. Therefore, it requireseven more scrubbing. An abrasive paste can bemade by mixing baking soda and water. Thebasic properties of baking soda also have asmall effect on grease and grime if it is appliedto the oven and left for several hours.
Making Connections
1.Survey the cleaners in your home or school.Which cleaners contain bases and which con-tain acids? What cleaning jobs can an acidcleaner perform well? How do most acidcleaners work?
2.Some companies claim to make environmen-tally sensitive cleaners. Investigate thesecleaners. What chemicals do they contain?See if you can infer how they work. Youmight like to design a controlled experimentto test the effectiveness of several ovencleaners. Obtain permission fromyour teacher before performing such anexperiment.

Specific Expectations  Is there a box of baking soda in your refrigerator at home? Baking soda is
sodium hydrogen carbonate. (It is also commonly called sodium bicarbon-ate.) Baking soda removes the odours caused by spoiling foods. Thesmelly breakdown products of many foods are acids. Baking soda, a base,eliminates the odours by neutralizing the characteristic properties of the acids.
Adding a base to an acid neutralizes the acid ’s acidic properties. This
type of reaction is called a neutralization reaction.
There are many different acids and bases. Being able to predict the
results of reactions between them is important. Bakers, for example,depend on neutralization reactions to create light, ﬂuffy baked goods.
Gardeners and farmers depend on these reactions to modify the character-istics of the soil. Industrial chemists rely on these reactions to produce theraw materials that are used to make a wide variety of chemicals andchemical products. (See Figure 10.13.)Acid-Base Reactions
You know sodium
chloride as common table salt. Asyou can see here, however, sodium chloride is anything butcommon. Sodium chloride is aproduct of an acid-base reactionbetween hydrochloric acid andsodium hydroxide.Figure 10.13
Neutralization Reactions
The reaction between an acid and a base produces an ionic compound
(a salt) and water.
acid+base→a salt+water
A saltis an ionic compound that is composed of the anion from an acid
and a cation from a base. For example, sodium nitrate is a salt that isfound in many kitchens. It is often added to processed meat to preservethe colour and to slow the rate of spoiling by inhibiting bacterial growth.Sodium nitrate can be prepared in a laboratory by reacting nitric acid withsodium hydroxide, as shown on the next page.hydrogenfuels

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 395The balanced chemical equation for this reaction shows that 1 mol of
nitric acid reacts with 1 mol of sodium hydroxide. If equal molar quantities of nitric acid and sodium hydroxide are used, the result is aneutral (pH 7) aqueous solution of sodium nitrate. In fact, when any
strong acid reacts with any strong base in the mole ratio from the bal-anced chemical equation, a neutral aqueous solution of a salt is formed.Reactions between acids and bases of different strengths usually do notresult in neutral solutions.
For most neutralization reactions, there are no visible signs that a
reaction is occurring. How can you determine that a neutralization reaction is taking place? One way is to use an acid-base indicator. This
is a substance that changes colour in acidic and basic solutions. Mostacid-base indicators are weak, monoprotic acids. The undissociated weakacid is one colour. Its conjugate base is a different colour.
In an acidic solution, the indicator does not dissociate very much. It
appears as colour 1. In a basic solution, the indicator dissociates muchmore. It appears as colour 2. Often a single drop of indicator causes a dra-matic change in colour. For example, phenolphthalein is an indicator thatchemists often use for reactions between a strong acid and a strong base. Itis colourless between pH 0 and pH 8. It turns pink between pH 8 and pH 10. (See Figure 10.14.)
A good indicator, such as the phenolphthalein shown here, must give a
vivid colour change.Figure 10.14

The balanced chemical equation shows that half the amount of sulfu-
ric acid will neutralize a given amount of potassium hydroxide. Theconcentration of sulfuric acid, however, is less than half the concen-tration of potassium hydroxide. Therefore, the volume of sulfuricacid should be greater than the volume of potassium hydroxide.

Chapter 10  Acids and Bases • MHR 399Acid-Base Titration
In the previous Sample Problems and Practice Problems, you were given
the concentrations and volumes you needed to solve the problems. Whatif you did not have some of this information? Chemists often need toknow the concentration of an acidic or basic solution. To acquire thisinformation, they use an experimental procedure called a titration. In atitration , the concentration of one solution is determined by quantitative-
ly observing its reaction with a solution of known concentration. Thesolution of known concentration is called a standard solution . The aim of
a titration is to ﬁnd the point at which the number of moles of the stan-
dard solution is stoichiometrically equal to the original number of molesof the unknown solution. This point is referred to as the equivalence
point. At the equivalence point, all the moles of hydrogen ions that were
present in the original volume of one solution have reacted with an equalnumber of moles of hydroxide ions from the other solution.
Precise volume measurements are needed when you perform a
titration. Chemists use special glass apparatus to collect these measure-ments. (See Figure 10.15.) As well, an acid-base indicator is needed tomonitor changes in pH during the titration.
A transfer pipette (bottom) measures a ﬁxed volume of liquid,
such as 10.00 mL, 25.00 mL, or 50.0 mL. A burette (top) measures a variable volume of liquid.
In a titration, a pipette is used to measure a precise volume of standard
solution into a ﬂask. The ﬂask sits under a burette that contains the
solution of unknown concentration. After adding a few drops of indicator, you take an initial burette reading. Then you start adding the known solu-tion, slowly, to the ﬂask. The end-point of the titration occurs when the
indicator changes colour. The indicator is chosen so that it matches itsequivalance point.
Titration Step by Step
The following pages outline the steps that you need to follow to preparefor a titration. Review these steps carefully. Then observe as your teacherdemonstrates them for you. At the end of this section, in Investigation 10-B, you will perform your own titration of a common substance: vinegar.Figure 10.15

400 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityRinsing the Pipette
A pipette is used to measure and transfer a precise
volume of liquid. You rinse a pipette with the solu-tion whose volume you are measuring. Thisensures that any drops that remain inside thepipette will form part of the measured volume.
1.Pour a sample of standard solution into a clean,
dry beaker.
2.Place the pipette tip in a beaker of distilled
water. Squeeze the suction bulb. Maintain yourgrip while placing it over the stem of thepipette. (If your suction bulbs have valves, yourteacher will show you how to use them.)
3.Relax your grip on the bulb to draw up a small
volume of distilled water.
4.Remove the bulb and discard the water by
letting it drain out.
5.Rinse the pipette by drawing several millilitres
of solution from the beaker into it. Rotate androck the pipette to coat the inner surface withsolution. Discard the rinse. Rinse the pipettetwice in this way. It is now ready to ﬁll with
standard solution.
Filling the Pipette
6.Place the tip of the pipette below the surface of
the solution.
7.Hold the suction bulb loosely on the end of the
glass stem. Use the suction bulb to draw liquidup just past the etched volume mark. (SeeFigure 10.16.)
8.As quickly and smoothly as you can, slide the
bulb off and place your index ﬁnger over the
end of the glass stem.
9.Gently roll your ﬁnger slightly away from end of
the stem to let solution drain slowly out.
10.When the bottom of the meniscus aligns with
the etched mark, as in Figure 10.17, press yourﬁnger back over the end of the stem. This will
prevent more solution from draining out.
11.Touch the tip of the pipette to the side of the
beaker to remove any clinging drop. See Figure10.18. The measured volume inside the pipetteis now ready to transfer to an Erlenmeyer ﬂask
or a volumetric ﬂask.
Transferring the Solution
12.Place the tip of the pipette against the inside
glass wall of the ﬂask. Let the solution drain
slowly, by removing your ﬁnger from the stem.
13.After the solution drains, wait several seconds,
then touch the tip to the inside wall of the ﬂask
to remove any drop on the end. Note: You maynotice a small amount of liquid remaining in thetip. The pipette was calibrated to retain thisamount. Do not try to remove it.Never use your mouth in place
of a suction bulb to draw a liquid into a pipette. The liquid could be corrosive orpoisonous. As well, you willcontaminate the glass stem.TITRATION TIP
Draw a bit
more liquid than you needinto the pipette. It is easierto reduce this volume thanit is to add more solutionto the pipettes.Figure 10.16
The bottom
of the meniscus must alignexactly with the etchedmark.Figure 10.17Practice removing the bulb and
replacing it with your index ﬁnger. You need to be able to
perform this action quickly andsmoothly.TITRATION TIP
You can prevent a
“stubborn ” drop from clinging to
the pipette tip by touching the tipto the inside of the glass surface.Figure 10.18
Adding the Indicator
14.Add two or three drops of indicator to the ﬂask
and its contents. Do not add too much indicator.Using more does not make the colour changeeasier to see. Also, indicators are usually weakacids. Too much can change the amount ofbase needed for neutralization. You are nowready to prepare the apparatus for the titration.
Rinsing the Burette
A burette is used to accurately measure the vol-
ume of liquid added during a titration experiment.It is a graduated glass tube with a tap at one end.
15.To rinse the burette, close the tap and add
about 10 mL of distilled water from a wash bottle.
16.Tip the burette to one side and roll it gently
back and forth so that the water comes in contact with all inner surfaces.
17.Hold the burette over a sink. Open the tap, and
let the water drain out. While you do this, checkthat the tap does not leak. Make sure that itturns smoothly and easily.
18.Rinse the burette with 5 mL to 10 mL of the
solution that will be measured. Remember toopen the tap to rinse the lower portion of theburette. Rinse the burette twice, discarding theliquid each time.
Filling the Burette
19.Assemble a retort stand and burette clamp to
hold the burette. Place a funnel in the top of theburette.
20.With the tap closed, add solution until the liquid
is above the zero mark. Remove the funnel.Carefully open the tap. Drain the liquid into abeaker until the bottom of the meniscus is at orbelow the zero mark.
21.Touch the tip of the burette against the beaker
to remove any clinging drop. Check that theportion of the burette that is below the tap isﬁlled with liquid and contains no air bubbles.
22.Record the initial burette reading in your
notebook.
23.Replace the beaker with the Erlenmeyer ﬂask
that you prepared earlier. Place a sheet of whitepaper under the Erlenmeyer to help you see theindicator colour change that will occur near theend-point.
Reading the Burette
24.A meniscus reader is a small white card with a
thick black line on it. Hold the card behind theburette, with the black line just under themeniscus, as in Figure 10.20. Record the volume added from the burette to the nearest0.05 mL.If you are right-handed, the tap
should be on your right as youface the burette. Use your lefthand to operate the tap. Useyour right hand to swirl the liq-uid in the Erlenmeyer ﬂask. If
you are left-handed, reversethis arrangement.TITRATION TIP
Near the end-point, when you
see the indicator changecolour as liquid enters the ﬂask
from the burette, slow theaddition of liquid. The end-point can occur very quickly.TITRATION TIP

402 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityThe Concentration
of Acetic Acid in Vinegar
Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid,
CH3COOH . Only the hydrogen atom that is
attached to an oxygen atom is acidic. Thus,acetic acid is monoprotic. As a consumer, youcan buy vinegar with different concentrations.For example, the concentration of table vinegar isdifferent from the concentration of the vinegarthat is used for pickling foods. To maintain con-sistency and quality, manufacturers of vinegarneed to determine the percent concentration ofacetic acid in the vinegar. In this investigation,you will determine the concentration of aceticacid in a sample of vinegar.

408 MHR • Unit 3  Solutions and SolubilityIsland at Risk:
A Simulation
Background
Would you rather have ﬁsh—or chips? People on
Prince Edward Island are discovering that their sourcesof both of these food items are increasingly at risk.
The fertile red soil of Prince Edward Island is
famous for potato growing. Agricultural corporationshave been increasing their potato plantings on thisisland province. In the process, they have been elimi-nating other crops, which has led to a monoculture.(“Monoculture” refers to the growing of a single cropin an area.) Potato pests are posing a huge threat tothis proﬁtable cash crop, however. Part of the problemresults from the fact that the potato ﬁelds are veryclose together. To combat the pests—potato bugs, inparticular—farmers are applying more and more pesti-cides, fertilizers, and herbicides to the potato ﬁelds.
What are the environmental effects of this heavy
use of pesticides (insecticides and herbicides)? Afterheavy rains on the island, large numbers of dead ﬁshhave been found in the ocean, and washed up on theshore near the potato farms. The suspected cause isthe leaching of sodium arsenite and other pesticidesused in the potato ﬁelds. Sodium arsenate is a chemi-cal used to kill both weeds and insects. If the poison-ing of the ocean waters continues, Prince EdwardIsland’s unique seafood industry will come to an end. Suggestions for dealing with this problem have
included:
• creating a mandatory untilled area spanning
20 m next to waterways;
• growing genetically engineered potatoes that are
more blight-resistant. These genetically modiﬁedpotatoes would contain genes from bacteria thathave insecticidal properties;
• employing alternative fertilization and pesticide
methods to reduce the amount of chemicals usedon the potato crop; and
• rotating crops (that is, alternating types of crops
from year to year) so that the spread of potatobugs and the overuse of soil would be less of a problem.
Plan and Present
Look up the properties of sodium arsenate in eitherthe CRC Handbook or the Merck Manual. As well,search the Internet for an MSDS sheet about sodium arsenate.
Using your knowledge of solutions and dissolving,
explain how the chemicals from the potato ﬁeldsend up in the water with the ﬁsh. Make a diagram,a poster, or a PowerPoint
TMpresentation that clearly
illustrates the processes involved in this type ofaquatic pollution.
Provide a minimum of two advantages and two
disadvantages of each of the four possible solutionsto the problem.
The provincial government in Charlottetown has
decided that action must be taken, in some form oranother. The following people and organizationshave been invited to participate on a board todevelop an action plan:4321

• the scientists who helped develop the genetically
engineered, blight-resistant potato variety
• the corporations who want to buy the potatoes
and process them
• people who ﬁsh for their living• potato farmers
(a)Your class will be divided into groups, and each
group will research the point of view of one ofthese interest groups. Consider questions such as these:
• To what extent do landowners have the right
to determine how they use their land?
• What recourse should the ﬁshers on P.E.I.
have available to them to respond to the threat posed to their livelihood?
• What possible consumers’ rights need to be
assessed in analyzing this issue?
(b)Before developing an action plan, each group
should decide on and state clearly their motiveand their mandate. In other words, what is thereason for their existence as a group and towhom is the group accountable? For example:
• Are the scientists working for biotechnology
companies or are they doing pure research?
• What is each group’s present policy regarding
issues such as environmental protection and sustainability?
• What points might be included in each
group’s short-term and long-term action plan?
(c)Make a one-page summary of your points to
hand out to other members at the meeting. Alarge diagram, poster, overhead transparency, or PowerPoint
™slide will help your group
illustrate how your action plan:
• will affect the environment
• acknowledges the scientiﬁc realities of the
leaching situation
• satisﬁes the needs of other interest gr oups
(d)Hold a meeting of the action plan board, to
present all points of view, and to try to reach a consensus on an action plan.

CHALLENGE
Did you realize that air turbulence
is caused by the behaviour of gases?Turbulence can be caused bychanges in air pressure in the atmosphere. Airplanes are designed,however, to adjust to the behaviourof atmospheric gases. The combus-tion in the engines, the shape of theairplane, and the air mixture that passengers breathe are all designedto take gas behaviour into account.
Gas behaviour and gas reactions
are part of everyday life. For exam-ple, photosynthesis is a reaction that uses carbon dioxide gas, alongwith other reactants, to produceoxygen gas. High in the atmosphere,ozone gas interacts with dangerousultra-violet light to protect us fromthe Sun’s harsh rays.
Scientists study gases to under-
stand how they react. This under-standing can help prevent furtherdamage to the environment. It alsoleads to advances in gas-relatedtechnology. Carbonated soft drinks,air bags, medical anaesthetics, scubaequipment, and rocket engines are
all based on gas chemistry.

In fact, however, many gases are present. Our atmosphere is made up of amixture of different gases. The most important of these gases is oxygen,which we need to breathe. But did you know that most of the air youbreathe is composed of nitrogen gas? This fact is well known to deep-seadivers, who encounter problems with nitrogen gas when diving far belowthe surface of the ocean.
Gases are important in many different areas, from medical technology
to the food industry. In this chapter, you will learn how particles behavein the gaseous, liquid, and solid states. You will also learn about laws that predict the behaviour of gases under different conditions of pressure,temperature, and volume.

Specific Expectations  Most of the universe is composed of plasma, a state of matter that exists at
incredibly high temperatures (>5000˚C). Under normal conditions, matteron Earth can only exist in the other three physical states, namely, thesolid, liquid, or gaseous states. As you learned in an earlier course, theparticle theory describes matter in all states as being composed of tinyinvisible particles, which can be atoms, ions, or molecules. In this section,you will learn how these particles behave in each state. You will alsolearn about the forces that cause their behaviour.
Solids and Liquids
In previous courses, you learned about the properties of the differentstates of matter. You may recall that both solids and liquids are incompressible. That is, the particles cannot squeeze closer together, or compress. The incompressible nature of solids and liquids is not due to the fact that particles are touching. On the contrary, the particletheory states that there is empty space between all particles of matter. The incompressibility of solids and liquids arises instead from the factthat these particles cannot move independently of each other. That is, the movement of one particle affects the movement of other particles, or is restricted by them.
This is especially true for solids. The particles of a solid are held
together in a framework, called a crystal lattice. In a crystal lattice, thepositions of solid particles are relatively ﬁxed. This explains why solidshave deﬁnite shapes: the particles are unable to slip past each other andthus change the shape of the solid.
Like solids, liquid particles cannot move independently of one
another. They can slip past each other enough, however, to ﬂow andchange shape.
Another property of states of matter is their motion. According to the
particle theory, all particles that make up matter are in constant motion.In solids, the range of motion of the particles is the most restricted. Eachparticle of a solid is only able to vibrate around a ﬁxed point in the lattice(see Figure 11.2). This is called vibrational motion . Since solid particles
are ﬁxed in space, the degree of disorder is very low.
Particles in the liquid state can move more freely than particles in the
solid state, although not entirely independently. Liquid particles movewith rotational motion as well as vibrational motion. This means that the
particles can rotate and change position. It explains why liquids are ableto ﬂow and change shape, but keep the same volume. Since liquid parti-cles move around more than solid particles, the liquid state has a higherdegree of disorder, as shown in Figure 11.3.
To summarise the discussion, particles in solids and liquids are
incompressible and thus have deﬁnite volumes. The particles in each statecannot move independently of each other. Therefore they are relativelyrestricted in their motion. How are the properties of gases different fromthose of solids and liquids?States of Matter and
the Kinetic Molecular Theory
The arrangement of
particles in a solid. Particlesvibrate in a ﬁxed position relativeto one another. They are unable tomove past each other.Figure 11.2
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 419The Gas State
Unlike solids and liquids, particles in the gaseous state are able to move
independently of one another. Gas particles are able to move from onepoint in space to another. This is called translational motion . Thus, gas
particles move with all three types of motion: vibrational, rotational, and translational. Gas particles move through space in random fashion.However, they do travel in straight lines until their course is altered bycollisions with other particles. Because gas particles move freely, there isa high degree of disorder in a gaseous state.
Gas particles move much faster than liquid particles. Liquids
always ﬂow to the lowest point because they are still greatly inﬂuenced bygravity. Because gas particles move so quickly, gravity does not affectthem as much. Gases ﬂow in all directions, including upward againstgravity, until all of the available empty space is occupied. This is whygases expand to ﬁll a container. (See Figure 11.4.)
Gases can be compressed, unlike both solids and liquids. What is
different about their particle arrangement that allows for this? The spacebetween gas particles is much larger than the space between liquid orsolid particles. Even if gas particles are moved closer together throughcompression, the distance between each particle is still very large. Theparticles remain in the gaseous state. When gas molecules are compressedfurther, eventually the forces between molecules become strong enough tohold the gas molecules together. At this point, the gas changes to the liq-uid state. This is known as condensation .
Forces Between Particles
You have examined some properties of solids, liquids, and gases. You
have seen how the motion of the particles affects these properties. Nowyou will examine how the particles affect each other.
The particle theory states that there are attractive forces between
particles. The weaker the attractive force is between particles, the freer theparticles are to move. Therefore, attractive forces between particles are attheir strongest in the solid state. Attractive forces are at their weakest inthe gaseous state.
The strength of attractive forces between particles in any physical
state depends on two major factors: type of force and temperature. Theeffect of temperature, or kinetic energy, on the state of a substance will becovered in greater detail later on in this section.
Attractions Between Charged Particles
What types of attractive forces exist between particles? In Chapter 3, you
learned that oppositely charged particles attract each other due to electro-
static attraction . Ionic bonding is one example of electrostatic attraction.
A positive ion (an atom or molecule that has lost electrons) is attracted toa negative ion (an atom or molecule that has gained electrons). Ions formvery strong ionic bonds . Since these attractive forces are so strong, ionic
compounds usually exist in nature as solids. For example, table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is a solid crystalline substance. It has a high melting point and a high boiling point.
Particles in liquids
are not held in a ﬁxed positionrelative to other particles. Theycan slide over and past oneanother.Figure 11.3
Gas particles move
freely in all directions, bouncingoff each other as well as off thewalls of their container.Figure 11.4
420 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryAttractions Between Polar Molecules
Not all particles are charged, but attractions can still form between them.
You learned about intermolecular forces in Chapter 3. Intermolecular
forces are forces that exist between neutral molecules, or between molecules and ions.
You know that some molecules are polar due to their asymmetrical
shapes. Sulfur dioxide ( SO
2) is one example of a polar molecule. These
molecules have a permanent dipole effect. This means that one end of the molecule is more positive, and the other end is more negative.
Polar molecules attract ions and other polar molecules.
The partially positive end of one molecule is attracted to the partially negative end of another molecule. This patterncontinues throughout the substance. These dipole–dipole
forces of attraction are not as strong as ionic bonds. Thus sub-stances made up of polar molecules can exist as liquids andgases. For example, ethanol ( CH
3CH2OH) is polar, and exists as
a liquid. You know this liquid as rubbing alcohol. Hydrogenchloride (HCl) is also polar. It is a gas under normal conditionsas shown in Figure 11.5.
Attractions Between Non-Polar Molecules
What about substances made of non-polar molecules? You
learned in Chapter 3 that weak dispersion forces form between
non-polar molecules. As temporary dipoles form, they cause molecules tomove closer together. However, these attractions are temporary and weak.Thus, most small non-polar molecules do not hold together long enoughto maintain their solid or liquid forms. As a result, most small non-polarmolecules exist as gases at room temperature. For example, carbon diox-ide (CO
2) is a gas at normal temperatures.
The Relationship Between Size and State
Dispersion forces are also the primary forces of attraction between large
non-polar molecules. However, as these molecules increase in size, theirmelting and boiling points rise. For example, methane ( CH
4) is a small
non-polar molecule. It has a very low boiling point and exists as a gas atroom temperature. Pentane ( C
5H12) is a larger non-polar molecule.
It has a higher boiling point, so it exists as a liquid at room temperature.Pentane has more sites along its length than methane does where tempo-rary dipoles can form. The dispersion forces add up, so that it takes more energy overall to separate the molecules. This leads to a higher boiling point.
To summarize, the state of a substance depends on the forces between
the particles of that substance. If the forces are very strong, that substanceis likely to exist as a solid. If the forces are weaker, that substance willexist as a liquid, or as a gas. The state of a non-polar substance alsodepends on the size of the molecule. Smaller non-polar molecules aremore likely to be gases. Larger non-polar molecules will probably exist asliquids or even solids. Table 11.1 shows the forces discussed in this sec-tion ranked in order of strength.What is a dipole? Go back to
Chapter 3 or Chapter 8 torefresh your memory.

Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 421Table 11.1 Attractive Forces
The Effect of Kinetic Energy on the State of a Substance
There is one more factor that affects the state of a substance: temperature,
which is related to kinetic energy. A hotter substance with high kineticenergy is more likely to overcome attractive forces between molecules,and exist as a gas. A cooler substance with low kinetic energy is morelikely to be a solid or a liquid. This explains why heating a substancecauses a change in state. When a solid is heated, it gains kinetic energy.Eventually it will melt, and become a liquid. When you add kinetic energy by heating a liquid, it will boil and become a gas. Earlier in thissection, you learned that gases move much more quickly than liquids orsolids. This is because gases have high kinetic energy.
Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases
The particle theory of matter does not discuss the kinetic energy of parti-cles. Kinetic energy is important, however, when describing the uniqueproperties of gases.
The kinetic molecular theory describes a hypothetical gas called an
ideal gas . In an ideal gas, the gas particles take up hardly any space. Also,
the particles of an ideal gas do not attract each other.The kinetic molecular theory of gases makes the following
assumptions:•The volume of an individual gas molecule is negligible compared
to the volume of the container holding the gas. This means thatindividual gas molecules, with virtually no volume of their own,are extremely far apart and most of the container is “empty” space.
•There are neither attractive nor repulsive forces between gas
molecules,
•Gas molecules have high translational energy. They move randomly
in all directions, in straight lines. (See Figure 11.6, on page 423.)
•When gas molecules collide with each other or with a container
wall, the collisions are perfectly elastic. This means that when gasmolecules collide, somewhat like billiard balls, there is no loss ofkinetic energy.
•The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly related to
the temperature. The greater the temperature, the greater the average motion of the molecules and the greater their average kinetic energy.Force Ionic Polar (dipole –dipole) Dispersion

Why Use the Kinetic Molecular Theory?
How and why did scientists formulate the kinetic molecular theory?
Experiments into gas behaviour demonstrate that, under normal tempera-tures and pressures, nearly all gases behave in similar and predictableways. The properties and behaviours of real gases can be generalized intoa theory of an ideal gas. This generalization makes it possible for us to calculate mathematically, with a high degree of accuracy, how real gaseswill behave under varying conditions.
Of course, no gas is really “ideal. ” The ideal gas theory ignores certain
facts about real gases. For example, an ideal gas particle does not take upany space. In fact, you know that all particles of matter must take upspace. Gas particles are small and far apart, however. Thus the spaceoccupied by the particles is insigni ﬁcant compared to the total volume
of the container. You will learn more about the behaviour of real gases in Chapter 12.
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 423Section Wrap-up
The molecular-level interpretation of gas behaviour given by the kinetic
molecular theory helps to explain the macroscopic, or “larger picture, ”
properties of gases in the real world. One of the most important propertiesof gases is their compressibility —how they react to the application of an
external force. In the next section, you will observe how gases behaveunder pressure. Later in this chapter, you will learn about some interest-ing applications of pressurized gases.

following observations.
(a)Gases are more compressible than liquids.
(b)The density of gases is less than that of solids.

Specific Expectations  The earliest use of pressure in English referred to a burden or worry
troubling a person ’s mind. Scientists found this a useful mental model
to picture what happens when force is applied to a speci ﬁc area. They
adopted the word pressure to describe any application of force over an area.
Throughout the rest of this chapter, you will discover how gases
behave when they are under pressure in a closed system. A closed system
is one with a constant amount of moles of a substance. It is not open tothe atmosphere. Gases in closed systems, from CO
2in ﬁre extinguishers
to O2in oxygen tanks, perform important functions in our lives.
Understanding the behaviour of gases in closed systems is essential to our safe and effective use of gases.
How is Pressure Calculated?
As you learned in previous studies, pressure is de ﬁned in physical terms
as the force exerted on an object per unit of surface area ( P=F/A). One
commonly used SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to 1 N/m2.
More often, pressure is reported in kilopascals (kPa), equal to 1000 Pa.
(You will learn about other units of pressure later in this section.)
Assume a student with a mass of 51.0 kg is sitting on a chair. The
force the student applies to the chair is 500.0 N. If the surface area of the chair seat is 0.05 m
2, the pressure the student exerts is
P=F
A=500.0 N
0.05 m2=10 000 N/m2=10 000 Pa =10.0 kPa
Figure 11.7 shows how a decrease in surface area can dramatically
increase pressure.Gas Pressure and Volume
A woman with a mass of 50.0 kg exerts a pressure of about 21 kPa on the
ﬂoor as she walks. If another woman with an equal mass is wearing high heels, she
will exert a pressure of about 5000 kPa as her heel hits the ﬂoor. This pressure is approx-
imately 240 times greater than if she were wearing ﬂat shoes!Figure 11.7
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 425How does a gas exert pressure? In a sense, it
cannot exert measurable pressure in the same waythat a solid or liquid can. The pressure of a gas is determined by the kinetic motion of its compo-nent molecules. Suppose hundreds of billions ofgas molecules are in random motion, striking theentire inner surface of their container. Each colli-sion exerts a force on the container ’s inner surface.
Picture in ﬂating a basketball. As you add more
and more air to it, more molecules collide againstthe inside wall of the basketball. Each collisionexerts a force on the basketball ’s inner surface
area. The collective number of collisions as wellas the strength of the force form the net or overallgas pressure. Since the molecules move in alldirections, the net pressure exerted will be equalthroughout. (Figure 11.8 illustrates this.)
Atmospheric Pressure
Despite the popular expression, you can ’t carry the world on your shoul-
ders! Scientists estimate that the lithosphere, or solid Earth, has a mass of
6.0×1024kg. The hydrosphere, or the portion of Earth covered by water,
has an estimated mass of 1.4×1021kg.
The column of air above one square metre (1 m2) at sea level and 0 ˚C
exerts a pressure of 101 325 Pa (1 Pa=1 N/m2). This is equivalent to a mass of about
10000 kg over an area of 1 m2!
You do constantly experience the pressure exerted by Earth ’s
atmosphere. Scientists estimate that the atmosphere has a mass of
5.1×1018kg. Thus air molecules, which have mass, are being pulled
down by gravity and are exerting pressure on all objects on Earth. Figure 11.9 shows how much pressure is exerted by the atmosphere over an area of 1 m

426 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryEarly Studies of Atmospheric Pressure
In the early seventeenth century, the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei
(1564 –1642) developed a suction pump. It used air to lift water up to the
surface from about 10 m underground. When drawn from greater depths,the column of water collapsed before it reached ground level. Galileo concluded that the water could not be pumped higher because it hadreached the “limit of vacuum. ” Pumping from any depth beyond 10 m
required a greater pressure from the suction pump than was provided by the atmosphere. However, Galileo did not know exactly how water was being moved up the tube.
From 1641 to 1642, Evangelista Torricelli (1608 –1647) served as
Galileo ’s secretary. He continued Galileo ’s experiments and concluded
that the weight of air was pushing down on the rest of the water. Theweight of the air pushed water up the column. This was a logical conclu-sion since gas molecules, like all matter on Earth, are pulled down by theforce of gravity.
Torricelli did further calculations involving the weight of the atmos-
phere pressing on the water. He then improved upon the experiment by using mercury, which has a density 13.6 times greater than water. He designed the apparatus which we now know as the barometer, shownin Figure 11.10. Torricelli ﬁlled a glass tube of 1 cm diameter, closed at
one end, with mercury. He then inverted the tube in a dish of mercury.Some of the mercury ran out of the tube. But about 760 mm of mercuryremained in the tube. This is about 13.6 times less than the height ofwater that Galileo could pump. It is the air pushing on the mercury in thedish that keeps this 760 mm of mercury in the tube.
Changes in Atmospheric Pressure
At ﬁrst, Torricelli considered his experiment a failure. The height of the
mercury column did not remain constant at 760 mm, but changed slightlyas the weather and air temperature changed. As you learned in Grade 10,these small changes in the height of the mercury column provide us withvaluable information. We can predict the weather, in part, by looking atchanges in atmospheric pressure. For example, if the atmospheric pres-sure decreases suddenly, a storm may be on the way.
Atmospheric pressure affects us in other ways, too. People who live at
high elevations, such as in the Rocky Mountains, have less mass of airabove them. At lower atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of waterdecreases. Because the water boils at a lower temperature, it takes longerto cook food in boiling water on a mountain than at sea level.
The following ExpressLab demonstrates atmospheric pressure in a
dramatic way, showing you ﬁrsthand the tremendous pressure that the air
around us can exert. Using the Internet or another
source, ﬁnd the averageatmospheric pressure at thetop of Mount Everest. If it takes four minutes to boil asoft-boiled egg at sea level,how long would it take to boilan egg at the top of MountEverest?

High Pressure Injectors
When gas molecules under high pressure are
allowed to escape and expand, they release kinetic energy. This energy has been harnessed tobene ﬁt human health by powering high-pressure
injectors, better known as jet injectors.
Jet injectors are hypodermic syringes that
use high-pressure gas instead of a needle toinject vaccines under a patient ’s skin. Dr. Robert
Higson (1913 –1996) developed the “Hypospray ”
in the 1940s. This device used spring pressureagainst a plunger to force a vaccine through atiny nozzle at 1000 km/h. The pressure wasenough to drive the vaccine into the tissue of a
patient ’s arm without breaking the skin.
Today jet injectors use a tank of compressed
gas and an automatic vaccine dispenser thatworks through a pistol-like injector. When triggered, the new device releases a measureddose of vaccine into a sterile chamber and asmall volume of gas through a hose. As the compressed gas expands, it forces the vaccine at high velocity through the injector ’s nozzle.
The process is fast and simple, ideal for perform-ing mass vaccinations. It also eliminates the problems of disposing of used syringes. Also, it protects medical personnel from infectionthrough accidental needle pricks.
In 1958, Higson led a team that inoculated
about 90 000 people in Asia and Africa againstpolio, typhoid, and cholera using the Hypospray.In 1965, the United Nation ’s World Health
Organization used the jet injector. The organiza-tion freeze-dried vaccines for its successful worldwide smallpox eradication program. For itskey role in eliminating smallpox from the list ofhuman diseases, the jet injector earned a newname —the “Peace Pistol. ”
In this ExpressLab, you will see just how powerful

428 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryUnits of Pressure
For many years, atmospheric pressure was measured in millimetres of
mercury ( mm Hg ). In the British Commonwealth and the United States,
inches of mercury were used. Standard atmospheric pressure, the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level and 0 ˚C, is 760 mm Hg. More
recently, in honour of the work of Torricelli, standard atmospheric pressure has been de ﬁned as 760 torr. 1 torr represents a column of
mercury 1 mm in height at 0 ˚C. Another common unit for measuring
pressure is atmospheres (atm), where 1 atm is equivalent to 760 torr.
While mm Hg, torr, and atm are still used to measure pressure, especiallyin technological and medical applications, the SI units are pascals (Pa) or kilopascals (kPa).
In other words, standard atmospheric pressure at 0˚C is equivalent to:
760 mm Hg =760 torr =1 atm=101.3 kPa
Using this relationship, we can convert from one unit to another. For
example, a pressure of 100.0 kPa is equivalent to
100.0 kPa ×760.0 torr
101.3 kPa=750.2 torr
The Relationship Between Pressure and Volume
Figure 11.11 shows a meteorologist preparing to release a weather balloon
partially ﬁlled with helium gas. As the balloon rises, atmospheric pressure
decreases. The volume of the balloon increases.
Weather balloons are partially in ﬂated with helium. They carry
specialised instruments to measure varying atmospheric conditions such as pressure,temperature, and humidity.
Since the helium atoms inside the balloon move randomly in all
directions, they constantly bombard all the area inside the walls of theballoon, exerting a pressure. With decreasing atmospheric pressure, thereare fewer air molecules to collide with the outside of the balloon. As thepressure outside the balloon becomes less than that inside the balloon, the balloon expands. Given an expandable container, such as a balloon,the volume occupied by the gas will increase when external pressuredecreases. As external pressure increases , gas molecules are forced closer
together. The volume of gas then decreases .Figure 11.11

Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 429When we refer to the volume of a gas , we are in fact talking about the
volume of the container . The de ﬁnition of the volume of a gas is the space
available for gas molecules to move around in . The kinetic molecular the-
ory of gases assumes that the volume of each gas molecule is essentiallyzero. Thus, the amount of space for them to move around in is the volumeof the container. For all gases, V
gas=the volume of the container holding
the gas. (Do not confuse this with the molar volume of gases. You will
learn about molar volume in Chapter 12.)
Think about how the relationship between pressure and area for
solids would apply if you were testing a gas in a three-dimensional container. You know that according to the kinetic molecular theory, gasmolecules exert pressure over the entire inside surface of their container.If the volume of the container is halved, what would happen to the pressure of the gas inside the container?
Robert Boyle (1627 –1691) was an Irish scientist with an interest in
chemistry. He investigated the relationship between pressure and volumeof gases at constant temperatures. By making careful measurements of thevolume of a trapped gas, he was able to describe what happened when the pressure exerted on the gas was increased. Figure 11.12 shows Boyle ’s
experiment. Boyle measured the length of the column of trapped air compared to the length of the column of mercury. Since the length of themercury column is directly related to its volume, Boyle was able todeduce the relationship between pressure and volume.
When liquid mercury is added to the open tube, the pressure caused
by the weight of mercury on the trapped gas increases. The volume of the trapped gas (b and c) decreases.
Since mercury is a poisonous element, you will use a different method in
Investigation 11-A to examine the relationship between the pressure andthe volume of a gas.Figure 11.12

Boyle measured the variance in length of a
column of trapped air. Since length is directlyproportional to volume in a column with a regu-lar diameter, this gave him an indirect measureof changes in volume of the air with increasedpressure. In this activity, air is trapped inside a sealed plastic pipette. You can measure the volume of the trapped gas in terms of the lengthof the column of air, the way that Boyle did morethan three hundred years ago. You will measurethe applied pressure in terms of the number ofturns of a clamp rather than in kPa.

432 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryBoyle ’s Law
In 1662, Robert Boyle stated that the volume of a given amount of gas, at
a constant temperature, varies inversely with the applied pressure . In
other words, as external pressure on a gas increases, the volume of the gasdecreases by the same factor. This statement is known as Boyle’s law .
Figure 11.13 illustrates Boyle ’s law using a bicycle pump.
1. With the piston pulled all
the way out, the air pressureinside a bicycle pump equalsthe air pressure outside.
2. If the piston is pushed
halfway down the cylinder,the volume of the cylinder is decreased to one half itsoriginal value. The pressuredoubles.
3. If the piston compresses the
air to one fourth its originalvalue, the pressure of the airinside the pump will be fourtimes higher than its originalvalue.
1. 2. 3.
Figure 11.13
Boyle found that this relationship
held true for all gases as long as thetemperature remained unchanged.As external pressure on a gasincreases, the volume of the gasdecreases. The gas molecules areforced closer together. However, ifthe volume of a gas decreases, thenthe gas molecules have to travel ashorter distance before they strikethe container walls, as shown inFigure 11.14. Since they travel ashorter distance, gas molecules willstrike the container walls moreoften per unit time. This increases
the internal pressure of the gas. (With an increased volume, there arefewer collisions per unit time and a lower gas pressure is exerted.)
In other words, as the pressure of a closed system increases, its vol-
ume decreases. If the pressure is decreased by half, the volume doubles.We can write this relationship mathematically by using the proportion-ality symbol, α. V α1/Pmeans that volume is inversely proportional to
the pressure.
Mathematically, the proportionality sign ( α) can be removed by
introducing a proportionality constant ( k).

Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 433In Investigation 11-A, when you plotted a graph of Pversus 1/ V, you
obtained a straight line. The slope of this line gives the value of the proportionality constant, k. If the pressure is tripled, the volume will
decrease to one third of its original volume, such that P×V=k. The
value of kdiffers depending on the gas sample and the temperature.
Remember, this mathematical relationship only applies if the temperatureremains constant. A graph of Pversus 1/ Vis shown in Figure 11.15.

happen simultaneously. Edmé Mariotte, a French scientist, investigated the pressure–volume relationshipof gases independently ofBoyle. He did not publish his work until 1676, fourteenyears after Boyle had. In manyEuropean countries, the math-ematical relationship betweengas pressure and volume isknown as Mariotte’s Law.FACTCHEM

Specific Expectations  As you learned in Section 11.1, the average kinetic energy of gas mole-
cules is directly related to the temperature. The greater the temperature,the greater the average motion of the molecules and the greater their average kinetic energy. In other words, the temperature of a substance isdeﬁned as the measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in
that substance.
When substances are cooled, they lose kinetic energy. How does this
affect their volume? Remember, for an ideal gas, we can think of its particles as having mass but no volume. When you perform Investigation11-B on page 438, imagine air behaving as an ideal gas. How do you thinkair, in an expandable container will react to temperature changes?
Temperature and Volume
Sometimes, scienti ﬁc discoveries are made well before any technological
application of them can be envisioned. At other times, the desire to develop new technologies leads to experiments from which discoveriesare made.
Jacques Charles (1746 –1823), a French scientist, was the ﬁrst to ﬁll a
balloon with hydrogen. He was also interested in hot-air balloons, whichwere being developed in France at the time. Charles investigated theexpansion rates of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Hefound that these gases all expanded by the same ratio. For each degreeCelsius increase in temperature, all of these gases would expand by a certain fraction. This fraction was 1/273
rdof their volume at 0 ˚C. For each
degree Celsius decrease in temperature, their volume would decrease bythe same fraction. Thus, if a gas at 0 ˚C were to be heated to 273 ˚C, its
volume would double. This held true when the pressure and the amountof gas remained constant. Figure 11.16 shows the expansion of the volumeof gas in a hot-air balloon as the air inside the balloon is heated.Gases and Temperature Changes
As you perform Investigation
11-B, keep in mind the ratio of 1/273 discovered by Charles.Can you recall from your previous studies a special sig-niﬁcance for the number 273?

These photographs show the gradual expansion of a hot air balloon.
Since hot air is less dense than cooler air, the balloon rises.Figure 11.16
Gas Temperature and Cryogenics
Some people wish to be frozen when they die,
trusting that future technologies will be able torevive them. This untested process is calledcryonics . It was ﬁrst suggested by Robert C.W.
Ettinger in 1962. Ettinger has since set up hisown Cryonics Institute in Michigan, wherepeople can have their bodies frozen and stored.We still cannot freeze and re-animate higheranimals, such as people. Cryogenic freezing,however, can suspend the life of tissues andorgans used for transplants. Cryogenics hasalso made many other technologies possible. It has proven that science and science ﬁction
are often closer than we think!
The term cryogenics can be applied to all
temperatures below the normal boiling point of oxygen, or –183˚C.
When substances encounter temperatures
this low, they often behave strangely. Liquidhelium, for example, becomes a “super ﬂuid”
at temperatures below −270.97 ˚C. The principle
of “superconductivity ” is just as interesting
Cryogenically cooled rings made out of metalssuch as lead and aluminum become “supercon-
ductors. ” They can keep currents travelling in
circles for hours even after scientists haveremoved the original source of electricity.
Scientists have made use of the strange
things that happen to matter at low tempera-tures. Superconductors have been used tomake huge electromagnets, like the one at theArgonne National Laboratory near Chicago.Argonne ’s electromagnet can produce a
magnetic ﬁeld 134 000 times as strong as
Earth ’s. It operates on relatively little power
because of its superconducting capabilities.Such magnets are used in nuclear powerresearch to ﬁnd new nuclear particles. And
while cryogenics has advanced nuclear science, it also helps scientists to study theeffects of nuclear radiation. Scientists studycryogenically frozen atoms suspended in anirradiated state to understand how nuclearradiation can harm human health.Cryogenically cooled magnets are used in MRI
technology.
Cryogenics produces large-scale amounts of
nitrogen and oxygen. Scuba divers and astro-nauts use compressed oxygen tanks that provide a six to eight hour supply of oxygen.Rocket engines use liquid oxygen as fuel. We use liquid nitrogen to make ammonia forfertilizers, to keep frozen foods cold duringtransport, and to fast-freeze these foods.
The list of applications of cryogenics is
long and varied, and research continues.Maybe Ettinger is right and one day all of theoccupants of the Cryonics Institute will liveagain!

Safety Precautions
•Be very careful when sealing the end of the
plastic pipette with a ﬂame. The plastic will
melt and may begin to burn. Hot, molten plastic can burn your skin.
•Do not inhale any of the fumes from the
plastic.
•Before lighting the Bunsen burner, check that
there are no ﬂammable solvents nearby.
Procedure
1.Squeezing the pipette bulb, draw enough
water into the pipette to form a small plug.The rest of the pipette should contain air.2.Using a ﬂame from a match or Bunsen burner,
carefully seal the open end of the pipette completely. Allow the pipette to cool for atleast 3 min before carrying on with the rest ofthe procedure.
3.Using scissors, cut off the tip of the bulb ofthe pipette.
4.Carefully attach the pipette to the ruler, usinga rubber band, so that the bottom of the tubeis even with the 1.0 cm mark of the ruler.
5.Fill a 400 mL beaker about two thirds full oftap water and add 3 or 4 ice cubes. Place thethermometer in the water. Then put the rulerwith attached pipette into the water. Allowthe ruler and pipette to sit for 5 min.

440 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryThe Kelvin Scale and Absolute Zero
Charles found that, regardless of the gas tested,
the x-intercept on a graph would always be
−273˚C. In 1848, Lord Kelvin (1824 –1907), a
Scottish scientist, realised the signi ﬁcance of
this ﬁnding. He reasoned that at −273˚C, molec-
ular motion would cease. At this temperature,kinetic energy would be zero. The volume of a gas would, hypothetically, also be zero.
Of course, real gas molecules do have
volume. Also, at low temperatures all gaseswill condense and change state. Still, Kelvinused this reasoning as the basis for a new tem-perature scale, the Kelvin scale . The starting
point for the scale, 0 K, is called absolute zero .
Figure 11.17 shows how absolute zero can be
hypothesized, based on data from experiments. The modern acceptedvalue for 0 K, derived with equipment more sophisticated than that avail-able to Charles, is −273.15 ˚C. Each unit in the Kelvin scale is exactly the
same as a unit in the Celsius scale.
There are no degree signs used in the Kelvin scale. More importantly,
there are no negative values. What would happen if you tried to calculatea temperature twice as warm as −5˚C? Mathematically, the answer would
be −10˚C, but this is a colder temperature. When mathematical manipula-
tions are involved in studying gas behaviour, you need to convert degreeCelsius temperatures into kelvins. This is done using the relationship
T
K=˚C+273.15 or˚C+273
Most often, you will round off and use 273 as the conversion factor
relating K and ˚C.
Charles ’ Law
Although Charles discovered that the volume of a ﬁxed amount of gas
at constant pressure was proportional to its temperature, he never pub-lished this ﬁnding. In 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778 –1850), a
French scientist, made reference to Charles ’ work in a published paper.
The relationship between temperature and volume has since becomeknown as Charles’ law . Charles ’ law states that the volume of a ﬁxed
mass of gas is proportional to its temperature when the pressure is keptconstant .
As you can see from Figure 11.19 on page 442, the volume of a gas
increases or decreases by a ﬁxed increment when subjected to a change in
temperature. The algebraic statement of Charles ’ law depends on using
absolute, or Kelvin, temperatures. This law is stated as VαT, where T
is measured in kelvins. (Figure 11.18 uses Charles ’ law to explain how a
thermometer works.)
Introducing a proportionality constant (k
1), this relationship can be
restated as
V=k1T orV
T=k1
This relationship only applies if pressure is kept constant and tempera-
ture is given in kelvins. If a sample of gas is collected at initial conditions(i), this relationship can be rewritten as
V
i
Ti=k1Volume (L)
Temperature1.02.03.0

(K) 73 173 273 373 473 573 673 773 0
As temperature
increases, particles move morerapidly, striking the outside of thethermometer with greater forceand frequency. The kinetic energyof the particles is transferred tothe particles inside the tube of the thermometer. The volume ofthe liquid inside the tube (usuallymercury or coloured alcohol)expands.Figure 11.18Absolute zero for
an ideal gas is −273.15 ˚C or 0 K,
the point at which all molecularmotion theoretically ceases.Figure 11.17
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 441Suppose the gas sample is subjected to a change in temperature. Under
the ﬁnal conditions ( f), there will be a volume change such that
Vf
Tf=k1
Since both initial and ﬁnal conditions are equal to the proportionality
constant, Charles ’ law can be written as
Vi
Ti=Vf
Tf
Thus, Charles ’ law can be restated as: the volume of a ﬁxed mass of gas
at constant pressure is directly proportional to its Kelvin temperature .
In the next ThoughtLab, you will convert your temperature ﬁndings from
Investigation 11-B into kelvins and see why you must use Kelvin tempera-ture when performing calculations with gases.
As you have learned, when making calculations
involving temperature in gas samples, Kelvintemperatures must be used. You will see why foryourself in this ThoughtLab.

Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 447Gay-Lussac ’s Law
Aside from balloons and syringes, most containers that are used to store
gases have a ﬁxed volume. You know that temperature is a measure of
the average kinetic energy of the molecules making up a substance. If thetemperature of a gas increases, but the volume of its container cannotincrease, what happens to the pressure of the gas inside?
Extending the work of Charles, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac discovered
the relationship between temperature and pressure acting on a ﬁxed
volume of a gas. (Remember that for gases, V
gas=volume of container
holding the gas.) As you will learn later in this section, this relationship is very important for the safe handling of gases under pressure in steeltanks or aerosol cans. Gay-Lussac’s law states that the pressure of a ﬁxed
amount of gas, at constant volume, is directly proportional to its Kelvintemperature . (See Figure 11.20.)
PαT
(if Tis given in kelvins and volume and amount of gas is constant)
Introducing a new proportionality constant (k
2), this relationship can be
restated as
P=k2T orP
T=k2
If we assign Piand Tias the initial conditions, and Pfand Tffor the ﬁnal
conditions, the above relationship can be rewritten as
Pi
Ti=Pf
Tf
As you will notice, this mathematical relationship is very similar to that
of Charles ’ law.
When temperature increases from Tito Tfin a rigid container with a con-
stant volume, the average speed of the gas molecules increases. Since the moleculesmove faster, they collide with each other and with the walls of the container more force-fully and more frequently. The gas pressure increases.Figure 11.20

Compressed Gases and Safety Concerns
The Gay-Lussac ’s law Sample Problem in this section indicates how care-
fully gases under pressure must be handled. Chlorine gas can cause seri-ous respiratory problems and irritate the skin and mucous membranes. Inextreme cases, death from suffocation could result from exposure to thisgas. Yet chlorine is an important industrial product. Compounds of chlo-rine are used in bleaches, oxidizing agents, and solvents, and as interme-diates in the manufacture of other substances.
Compressed gases are commonly stored in thick-walled
metal cylinders designed especially for this purpose. All cylinders must comply with Canadian Transport Commission(CTC) regulations. Containers must be permanently marked witha serial number and speci ﬁcations for the volume of the cylinder
and the maximum pressure it can withstand. Containers must betested every ﬁve to ten years, with the date of the test stamped
on the cylinder.
Figure 11.22 on the next page shows a typical compressed
gas cylinder. You can see that it is built to withstand high pressures. There are other safety precautions as well, however.
Most cylinders used to store gases have safety devices
regulating the internal gas pressure. The most common of theseis a pressure relief valve . If the pressure inside the cylinder
increases to a dangerous level, a spring allows the valve to openand release excess gas until the internal pressure returns to asafe level. Some pressure relief valves will close once excess gas is released. These valves are relatively expensive comparedto non-reclosing valves. Non-reclosing valves are found on common household products such as aerosol hairsprays.
Gas cylinders have pressure
valves to help the user regulate the amount ofgas escaping when the cylinder is opened.Figure 11.21
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 451Cylinders used to store gases such as acetylene ( C2H2), that
could cause an explosive chemical reaction at high tempera-tures, are ﬁtted with fusible plugs . These plugs are designed to
melt and allow gas to escape at temperatures lower than those atwhich hazardous reactions can start. Fusible plugs for acetylenecylinders are made of a metal alloy that melts at 100 ˚C.
Not all compressed gas cylinders are ﬁtted with pressure-
relief valves or fusible plugs. Cylinders containing toxic gasessuch as chlorine or phosgene ( COCl
2) are one example. These
gases could cause serious harm to health if released into the air in suf ﬁcient quantities. Therefore, these gases, like all
compressed gases, must be handled with great care. They must be stored in a well-ventilated, dry area. The surroundingstorage area must be ﬁre-resistant, and proper ﬁre-ﬁghting
equipment must be immediately available. Gas cylinders shouldnever be stored near electrical circuits that might spark or nearother ignition sources such as open ﬂames. Material Data Safety
Sheets must be available, and all cylinders must be clearly labelled with WHMIS warning signs.

Specific Expectations  You may have heard a common joke about Canadian weather: “If you
don’t like it, wait an hour and it will change. ” While this is an exaggera-
tion, atmospheric pressure and temperature rarely remain constant for any extended period of time. Since the volume of gases changes whenpressure and temperature change, standards have been designed to allowa comparison of different gas volumes.
The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is taken as stan-
dard pressure (760 mm Hg =760 torr =1 atm =101.3 kPa). The freezing
point of water (0 ˚C or 273 K) is de ﬁned as standard temperature .
Together, these conditions are referred to as standard temperature and
pressure (STP). (See Figure 11.23.) The normal conditions under which
we live are referred to as standard ambient temperature and pressure .
These conditions are known as SATP , deﬁned as 25 ˚C and 100 kPa.
How could we ﬁnd what the volume of a gas, measured under
different conditions, would be when changed to STP or SATP?
Boyle established that pressure and volume are inversely proportional:
P
iVi=PfVf
Charles found that volume and temperature are directly proportional:
Vi
Ti=Vf
Tf
Gay-Lussac discovered that pressure has the same relationship to
temperature as volume does:
Pi
Ti=Pf
Tf
Do you notice a pattern here?
Pressure and volume are directly related to temperature, and inversely
related to each other. Write this as one law, and it is possible to calculatesituations in which three variables change at the same time. The mathe-matics work out just as consistently as in the two-variable equations.
Combined Gas Law Calculations
Under what conditions might
you use standard ambient tem-perature and pressure as a reference rather than standardtemperature and pressure ?This photograph
illustrates typical STP conditions:0˚C at sea level.Figure 11.23
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 453The Combined Gas Law
Boyle ’s law can be used to solve for changes in volume when pressure
changes. The gas must be in a closed system and the temperature mustremain constant. You can use Charles ’ law to solve for changes in volume
with temperature changes. This law works only in a closed system inwhich pressure remains constant. Gay-Lussac ’s law can solve problems in
which the amount and volume of gas remain constant while the tempera-ture and pressure change.
As you learned, Boyle ’s law ( Vα1/P) is expressed mathematically
as PV=k. Charles ’ law ( VαT) is expressed mathematically as V/T=k
1
when temperature is recorded in kelvins. Combining these two
expressions gives:
V α1
P×T or V αT
P
Introducing a new proportionality constant ( k3), we can write
V=T
P×k3 orPV
T=k3
This mathematical relationship is the combined gas law .
If a sample of a gas is trapped at a measured set of initial conditions,
the combined gas law can be rewritten as
PiVi
Ti=k3
As this gas is then subjected to changes in pressure and temperature,
the ﬁnal condition of the gas can be described mathematically as
PfVf
Tf=k3
Since both expressions are equal to the same proportionality constant ( k3),
the combined gas law can be written as
PiVi
Ti=PfVf

Geysers form in
areas of early volcanic activity or after a volcanic blast. Theyshould be approached with caution since the hot water thaterupts can cause severe burns.Figure 11.25Before a volcano
erupts, there is a tremendousbuild-up of ﬂuid and gas
pressures inside the volcano dueto magma, steam, and gases.Figure 11.24Gases and Natural Phenomena
Gases under pressure are responsible for natural phenomena such as
volcanoes and geysers. On March 20, 1980, residents in the northern partof Washington state heard a rumble from the mountains. They were told itwas only a minor earthquake. By March 27, seismologists were sure thatsomething more was involved. Deep inside one of the mountains, Earth ’s
crust was moving. The lower portion of the crust was melting into hot liquid called magma . The magma started rising up through cracks in the
crust. Trapped water quickly turned into superheated steam. Trappedgases added to the increasing pressure inside the mountain. Then, on May 18, 1980, the top half of Mount St. Helens blew away in a giganticexplosion. It released all of the built-up pressure, along with many tonnesof rock and ash, twenty kilometres into the atmosphere. It also releasedsteam, and gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide.(See Figure 11.24.)
Other gases released in volcanic explosions include the oxides, sul ﬁdes,
and chlorides of carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, chlorine, and ﬂuorine. These
include CO
2, CO, SO2, SO3, H2, H2S, Cl2, HCl, and F2. It is estimated that
the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991 releasedabout 1.8×10
10kg of gases and ash into the atmosphere.
After a volcanic blast, or in an area of volcanic activity, geysers may
form. Cool water from Earth ’s surface trickles down between rocks. It
drains deep into Earth ’s crust, into regions where hot magma is still
present. As the water is heated, it forms steam. The steam rises back upthough ﬁssures and cracks, meeting more water and heating it up as well.
More and more boiling water accumulates, until suddenly, through a narrow opening, the pressurized hot water is violently ejected. As thewater cools in the air, it falls back and the process starts again.Yellowstone National Park in the United States has one of the mostfamous geysers in the world, Old Faithful . It erupts approximately once
every sixty- ﬁve minutes. (Figure 11.25 shows Old Faithful erupting.)
In Chapter 12, you will learn more about the gas chemistry of
our atmosphere.
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 459Dalton ’s Law of Partial Pressures
What if there are two gases in one container, or as in the case of the
atmosphere, a mixture of many gases? How does this affect the pressure?
The English scientist John Dalton did a very thorough analysis of the
atmosphere. He concluded that it comprised about 79% nitrogen and 21%oxygen. (See Table 11.2 to ﬁnd out how close he really was.) Dalton noticed
that the water vapour, however, seemed quite variable, so he did furtherexperiments. He obtained some very dry air, and measured the pressure in the container. He then introduced some water vapour. The pressureincreased! Dalton repeated and adjusted his experiment time after time,always with the same results. He concluded that the total pressure of a
mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures of each of the individual gases .
This is called Dalton’s Law of partial pressures . (See Figure 11.27 below.)
Table 11.2 Components of the Dry Atmosphere
The action of winds mixes the atmosphere so that the
composition of the dry atmosphere is fairly constant over the entire Earth. Water vapour, though an important compo-nent of the atmosphere, is not listed in the table. The quantityof water vapour in the air, or humidity , is variable. In desert
climates, the quantity of water vapour will be very small (lowhumidity). In tropical areas, or near large bodies of water, thequantity of water vapour in the air can be quite substantial(high humidity).Components Percentage

Dalton extended this idea to enhance what he had discovered about the
composition of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is 79% nitrogen, andthe atmospheric pressure on a certain day is, for example, 101.3 kPa, then he concluded that the nitrogen itself must be contributing
79
100×101.3 kPa =80 kPa
The other gases in the atmosphere contribute pressures corresponding to
their percentage of the total composition of air.
The generalized form of Dalton ’s law of partial pressures is
Ptotal=P1+P2+P3+...+Pn
This law can be applied to any mixture of gases. Study the following
Sample Problem and try the Practice Problems to verify your understand-ing of how Dalton ’s law works.

“useless ” gas? In this section, you will learn about how gases are used.
You will ﬁnd out more about oxygen and nitrogen, and discover the
importance of gases in deep-sea exploration.
Compressed Oxygen
You may never really think about breathing —until it becomes hard to do.
In certain situations, normal human respiratory functions are disrupted.Hospitals use compressed oxygen for patients with respiratory disorderssuch as emphysema, pneumonia, or lung cancer.
You may have heard of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) chambers being used
to treat sports injuries. A high oxygen concentration in the blood causesblood vessels to constrict. This lowers the swelling that can occur ininjured tissues. How is this high oxygen content delivered to the blood? In an HBO chamber such as that shown in Figure 11.28, air is compressedto three times normal atmospheric pressure. The patient breathes pureoxygen ( O
2(g)) through a mask. The highly compressed air forces O2(g)in
the lungs into the blood. This increases of dissolved O2(g)in the blood-
stream. Consequently, oxygen is delivered rapidly to all the blood vesselsof the body. In fact, oxygen can reach the injured tissue at 15 times thenormal rate!
The use of compressed oxygen can bene ﬁt not only athletes, but also
vulnerable premature babies. Premature babies can be af ﬂicted with hya-
line-membrane disease. This condition prevents the alveoli in their lungsfrom in ﬂating, which leads to serious breathing dif ﬁculties. Placing these
babies in an oxygen-rich environment such as an HBO or an incubator(Figure 11.28) helps in ﬂate the alveoli. This increases the infants ’ chances
for survival.Gas Applications
Medical applica-
tions of pressurized oxygen canhelp the very strong, the veryweak, and everyone in between.Figure 11.28
Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 463Oxygen at High Altitudes
At other times, respiratory functions may be normal, but the environment
poses problems. Commercial jet planes ﬂy at an altitude of around 9.5 km.
Airplanes carry pressurized oxygen for their passengers to breathe as theyﬂy at high altitudes. Mountain climbers also need compressed oxygen
when climbing to great heights. Those exploring ocean depths need oxy-gen as well. Scuba divers and submarine crews need compressed oxygento breathe when they are underwater. You will learn more about underseaexploration later in this section.
Careers in Chemistry
Cancer Research Specialist
The National Cancer Institute of Canada estimates
that in the year 2000 there were more than 132 000 new cases of cancer and 65 000 deathscaused by cancer in Canada. People are desper-ate for treatment.
Dr. Abdullah Kirumira, President and lead
scientist at BioMedica Diagnostics in Windsor,Nova Scotia, has developed a way to speed updrug testing. This method uses compressed carbon dioxide and a dry chemistry diagnosticssystem including the ﬁreﬂy enzyme, luciferase.
Growing Cancer Cells for Testing
To obtain a consistent supply of cancer cells to
test, CO2is pumped from a compressed gas
cylinder. It is depressurized through a regulatorinto a specially designed incubator kept at about
37˚C, the optimum temperature for cell growth.
This CO2-enriched atmosphere plays two roles:
•it is required for rapid cellular metabolism; and
•it interacts with a bicarbonate buffer in the
growth medium to maintain an optimum pHbalance.
Global Ties
In 1975, during the reign of dictator Idi Amin, Dr. Kirumira ﬂed his native Uganda to Iraq,
where he earned a B.Sc. in food technology. He then travelled to England for a Master ’s
degree in dairy chemistry. From there, he movedto Australia where he earned his Ph.D. in biotechnology. In 1990, he and his wife moved toNova Scotia in search of a slower-paced lifestyle.
At BioMedica, Dr. Kirumira oversees
12 employees, six of whom have advanceddegrees, three technicians and three administra-tors. In addition, Dr. Kirumira teaches biochem-istry and biotechnology at Acadia and DalhousieUniversities.
He frequently visits his home in Uganda.
From Uganda, Dr. Kirumira says he can “take
back what I have learnt from the West to help the people who probably need it the most. ”

A ﬁre breaks out and smoke begins to ﬁll the room. Breathing becomes
difﬁcult. Should you open a window to let the smoke out before you leave
through the door? You may have learned you should never open windowsbefore leaving the area of a ﬁre. A ﬁre can only burn as long as it has
sufﬁcient oxygen. (See Figure 11.29.)
Oxygen is an extremely important gas because it supports combustion.
(You will learn more about combustion reactions in Unit 5.) The moreoxygen available, the hotter a ﬁre will burn. Pressurized oxygen is used
in the manufacture of steel and specialized alloys. In the manufacture ofsteel, oxygen is used to remove excess carbon by burning the carbon intocarbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. High levels of carbon make steel toobrittle for many uses.
A remarkable invention called the fuel cell is used by the space
industry. Some fuel cells burn hydrogen and oxygen gas, leaving water asa by-product (which astronauts can then drink). Companies such asBallard Power Systems Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia are working tomake this technology practical for automobiles. Fuel cells are completelynon-polluting. However, the current process for making large amounts ofhydrogen gas does create a good deal of pollution, in the form of CO
2.
Coal or another hydrocarbon is used to heat up and decompose water in areaction similar to the following:
heat
CH4(g)+2H2O(g)→CO2(g)+4H2(g)
Before astronauts can use the fuel cell in space, they ﬁrst have to get
there! Liquid oxygen is an important component of rocket fuel. Liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen are mixed and ignited in a combustion chamber. This reaction provides a very rapid expansion of gas. It producesenough energy to lift extremely heavy rockets carrying crewed vessels,such as the Space Shuttle, into orbit (Figure 11.30).www.school.mcgrawhill.ca/re

CO2is a greenhouse gas,
thought to contribute to globalwarming. Many countriesaround the world have soughtto reduce their emissions of
CO
2. International climate con-
trol treaties, such as theMontr éal Protocol, have set
targets to do this.
Since plants cycle CO
2out of
the atmosphere, several coun-tries including Canada haveargued that countries withlarge forest resources shouldbe able to claim them as “car-
bon sinks. ” Rather than cutting
their CO

get amount, Canada and othercountries maintain that theyshould be allowed to claim areduction for the CO
2absorbed
by their large forests.

Chapter 11  The Behaviour of Gases • MHR 465Nitrogen ’s Many Uses
Inert gases are not very reactive. The word inert is also a synonym for
sluggish and slow. Something with the property of inertness hardlysounds useful! Yet this very property makes nitrogen extremely valuablein technological and industrial applications.
Because nitrogen gas reacts with very few substances, it can be used
to blanket substances, preventing them from reacting with oxygen. (Areaction with oxygen is called oxidation.) Blanketing means covering
something with nitrogen, displacing all of the oxygen. This usually hap-pens in a closed container. For example, ground coffee can taste bitterwhen exposed to oxygen for long periods of time. Packaging coffee in anitrogen-enhanced container helps coffee keep its ﬂavour. Gaseous nitro-
gen is also used for the long-term storage of fruits such as apples, allowingus to enjoy a wide variety of produce out of season.
Liquid nitrogen ’s low boiling point (77 K) means that it can be used in
food preservation. Foods frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen retain morenutrients than slowly frozen foods. Less damage is done to cell structureduring the quick-freezing process. Freezing foods this way also removesmoisture, decreasing their weight and size. Freeze-dried foods are oftenused by people who require easily portable, lightweight food, such ascampers, the military, and space explorers.
In cryosurgery, liquid nitrogen is used to fast-freeze cancerous tissues
and warts. This proven new technique kills the cancerous area and allowssurgeons to safely remove the dead tissue.
Gases and Undersea Exploration
Throughout history, humans have tried to explore the little-known worldof the deep seas. Even with modern diving gear, the deep oceans are adangerous place for humans. The air that a diver breathes to stay aliveunderwater can itself be one of the greatest hazards. That ’s because of the
tremendous pressure exerted by the waters above a diver. For roughlyevery 10 metres of depth, water pressure on the diver ’s body adds the
equivalent of one unit of atmospheric pressure (Figure 11.31).
The air that a diver breathes (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) must equal
the pressure of the surrounding water if the diver ’s lungs are to stay
inﬂated. Of course, this gas pressure increases as a diver goes deeper.
As the gas pressure increases, the diver ’s bloodstream and body tissues
absorb higher and higher volumes of gases.
Beyond depths of roughly 40 –60 metres,
the increased volumes of gas in the diver ’s body
can cause nitrogen narcosis . When nitrogen
narcosis strikes, normal feelings become danger-ously exaggerated. A diver may experience ablissful giddiness, along with disorientation andimpaired judgement. This condition is called“rapture of the deep. ” Divers in this state
have been known to remove their breathingapparatus to swim like ﬁsh, mistake up for
down, or simply lose track of how long theyhave been underwater.
At the other extreme, a diver ’s normal sense
of caution may degenerate into irrational fear or even panic. A panicked diver may do the very
At 50 m underwater, a diver experiences pressure
about ﬁve times higher than normal.Figure 11.31
466 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric Chemistryworst thing —rush to the surface without pausing to decompress on the
way up. Why is this dangerous?
The dissolved gases such as nitrogen in the diver ’s bloodstream are
under pressure. This is much like the carbon dioxide that is dissolved in acan of soda. If the diver returns to the surface too quickly, these dissolvedgases behave similarly to the gas in soda when a can is opened. The gasesescape from the blood as bubbles in the diver ’s blood vessels. These bub-
bles can block the ﬂow of blood. They produce a painful and potentially
fatal condition called “the bends. ”
Both nitrogen narcosis and the bends make prolonged deep diving a
risky business. They limit both the safe depth and safe duration of humandiving. Even skilled professional divers rarely descend beyond about 50 metres. Also, they rarely remain at that depth for much more than 30 minutes.

You are probably used to sharing scientiﬁc ideas and observations with
your classmates as you work in pairs or in small groups. If you are famil-iar with Internet chat rooms and e-mail, you may even share your ideaswith people around the world. Sharing scientiﬁc ideas is an essential partof scientiﬁc discovery. Back in the early nineteenth century, the ideas thatled to the complete gas laws were shared between colleagues in much thesame way that you share scientiﬁc ideas with your classmates.
During the nineteenth century, scientists across Europe organized
academies , or science societies. (This practice still exists today.)
Belonging to an academy allowed much more communication among scientists. They read the papers and reports that other scientists had published, wrote letters, and held meetings to discuss ideas. They workedtogether to develop many important theories and laws, including the gas laws.
In this chapter, you will study more of the gas laws. Although these
laws were discovered almost 200 years ago, they are still accepted today.You will learn how the gas laws allow you to solve many problemsinvolving gas behaviour. You will also learn about some of the modernapplications and technological advances associated with the gas laws. You will have a chance to test the gas laws through your own experimentsand to compare your results with those of early scientists. Finally, youwill learn about some of the gas reactions that occur in our atmosphere.

Specific Expectations  Near the beginning of the nineteenth century, Joseph Gay-Lussac experi-
mented with the volumes of gases. He found that adding two volumes of gas to one volume of gas produced only two volumes of gas. Puzzled,Gay-Lussac tried adding three volumes of gas to one volume. The resultwas still two! When he tried adding one volume of gas to a second volume of gas, again the result was two. What was going on?
In England, around the same time, John Dalton studied the masses
of compounds as they reacted to produce products. After Dalton readabout the similar work of other scientists, such as Lavoisier and theBritish scientist Joseph Priestley, he contacted Gay-Lussac. He describedhis results and hypotheses to Gay-Lussac. In 1808, both men publishedtheir theories. After examining the theories of Dalton and Gay-Lussac, anItalian scientist named Amedeo Avogadro formulated a hypothesis thatcombined their theories.
The information that was shared by these three scientists led to the gas
laws that we use today.
The Molar Volume of Gases
Gay-Lussac measured the volumes of gases before and after a reaction.
His research led him to devise the law of combining volumes : When gases
react, the volumes of the reactants and the products, measured at equaltemperatures and pressures, are always in whole number ratios. For example, 2 volumes of hydrogen gas react with 1 volume of oxygen gas to produce 2 volumes of water vapour.\Figure

Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 473John Dalton examined the masses of compounds before and after a
reaction. Dalton’s research led him to propose the law of multiple
proportions : The masses of the elements that combine can be expressed
in small whole number ratios.
By combining these ideas, Avogadro related the volume of a gas to the
amount that is present (calculated from the mass). Avogadro divided
Dalton’s mass ratios by the molar masses of the elements to obtain themole ratios. He realized that these mole ratios were the same as the vol-ume ratios that Gay-Lussac had obtained. For example, 1 L of hydrogengas reacts with 1 L of chlorine gas. Avogadro decided that there must bethe same number of molecules in each litre of gas. Thus, Avogadro’s
hypothesis was formulated: Equal volumes of all ideal gases at the same
temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.
Figures 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 show the three reactions that produced
Gay-Lussac’s confusing observations. You can see that the mole ratios arethe same as the volume ratios. Today our knowledge of atoms and mole-cules helps us understand Gay-Lussac’s results. We know that gases aremade of molecules that may contain more than one atom.

Avogadro’s hypothesis can be written as a mathematical law, shown here.
Based on Avogadro’s law, one mole of a gas occupies the same volume as
one mole of another gas at the same temperature and pressure. The molarvolume of a gas is the space that is occupied by one mole of the gas. Molar
volume is measured in units of L/mol. You can ﬁnd the molar volume of
a gas by dividing its volume by the number of moles that are present (
V
n).

the same as the molar volume of another gas at the same temperature andpressure. In fact, the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.
Figure 12.5 shows a balloon with a volume of 22.4 L compared to somecommon objects. This is a fairly large volume of gas. For example, a basketball has a volume of only 7.5 L.
One mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L (22.4 dm3). How large is 22.4 L?
The other objects are shown for comparison.
In Chapter 11, you learned that temperature, pressure, and volume are
related. Based on Avogadro ’s law, the number of moles is related to the
temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas. Therefore, Avogadro ’s law can
be applied to solve gas problems involving moles and volume, when thetemperature and pressure remain constant. Figure 12.6 explains the rela-tionship among temperature, pressure, volume, and number of moles of a gas.
The following Sample Problems show you how to do gas calculations
using Avogadro ’s law.
At a temperature ( T), a given amount of a gas ( n) produces a pressure ( P).
When more gas is added, the number of moles ( n) increases. This results in more molec-
ular collisions with the container walls, thus increasing the pressure of the gas. The volume ( V) of the gas increases until the pressure is again equal to the pressure of the
surroundings.Figure 12.6PgasPgas

Volumes of Real Gases

Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 483A Deeper Look: Real Gas Deviations
Do real gases always behave like ideal gases? At STP, you have seen
that most real gases behave like ideal gases. At high pressures and/or low temperatures, however, gases no longer behave ideally. To understandwhy, recall the characteristics of an ideal gas, according to the kineticmolecular theory. (You learned this in Chapter 11.)•Gas molecules have insigni ﬁcant volume of their own.
•Molecules have no attractive forces between each other or with their
container.
•Molecules move in perfectly straight lines.
•Collisions are completely elastic and, thus, do not use up energy.
These characteristics led to the ideal gas law. They are accurate enough
for most applications. They are not perfect, however. In fact, most gasesfall short of these characteristics in many ways: •The particles of a real gas have a signi ﬁcant volume of their own.
•Molecules do attract each other.
•Molecules do not necessarily move in straight lines.
•Collisions are not completely elastic.
At high pressures and/or low temperatures, gases have smaller volumes.
This means that the gas molecules are closer together. Since they are closer together, the molecules interact more than when they are far apart.It is no longer true to say that the molecules have no attractive forcesbetween each other or with their container. Part A of Figure 12.8 illus-trates how this affects the pressure of a gas. Also, since the total volume is smaller, the amount of space taken up by the gas molecules is moreimportant. You can no longer ignore the volume of the gas molecules. Part B of Figure 12.8 illustrates that gas molecules do occupy part of thevolume of the container.
Scientists who want more accuracy in their experiments have adapted
the ideal gas law to re ﬂect the behaviour of real gases. In later chemistry
courses, you will learn more about this corrected version of the ideal gaslaw, called the Van der Waals equation .
To summarize, at low pressures and high temperatures, most gases
behave as ideal gases. Under any conditions that allow attractive forcesbetween molecules to occur, gases no longer behave as an ideal gas. Theybehave as real gases.
Look back at Table 12.1. It
gives more accurate molar vol-umes for several gases. Usingwhat you have learned aboutthe way real gases behave,explain why these molar volumes are slightly differentfrom the molar volume of anideal gas.
A B(A) Because parti-
cles are attracted to each other,the pressure is reduced. (B) Sinceparticles take up space, the totalvolume of empty space is smallerthan the volume of the container.Figure 12.8
Arriving at the Ideal Gas Law
In the Sample Problem earlier, you used three steps to ﬁnd the molar
volume of nitrogen gas. After calculating the number of moles, you calculated the ﬁnal volume using the combined gas law. Then you used
Avogadro ’s law to ﬁnd the volume of one mole of nitrogen. There is an
easier way to do problems like this —by combining the two gas laws.
After Avogadro ’s work, it did not take scientists long to connect Vαn
(Avogadro ’s law) with Vα
T
P(the combined gas law).
As you know, all gases behave in a similar way. The universal gas
constant (R), which applies to all gases, was derived for the ﬁnal equation
given above. Examine the calculation below to see how Rwas derived.
For one mole of gas at STP,

R=PV

=8.31kPa·L
mol·K
When it is measured more accurately, the universal gas constant ( R)
has a value of 8.314 kPa·L
mol·K. This was the ﬁnal piece of the equation. The
resulting equation is an ef ﬁcient tool for solving many problems that
involve gases.
The ideal gas law states that the pressure multiplied by the volume is
equal to the number of moles multiplied by the universal gas constant andthe temperature.
Guidelines for Using the Ideal Gas Law
•Always convert the temperature to kelvins (K).
•Always convert the masses to moles (mol).
•Always convert the volumes to litres (L).
•Using the ideal gas law will be easier if you always convert the
pressures to kilopascals (kPa). Then you can memorize the value of R(8.314
kPa·L
mol·K) and use it for every calculation. If you happen to
forget the value of R, you can calculate it by ﬁnding Rfor 1 mol of

Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 489Studying gases and their properties becomes more interesting when you
realize that your own body is a container for gases. Your lungs hold air, animportant solution of gases that you need to live. As well, there is theembarrassing type of gas, called methane, that results from the digestiveprocess. How many moles of oxygen do your lungs hold? Using the lawsand properties you have learned, you can now calculate this fact aboutyour own body. (See Figure 12.9.)
Your lungs hold about 4 L of air. When you breathe out,
only 500 mL of air is expelled. The same amount of air is taken in when you inhale one breath. If air contains 20% oxygen gas, how many moles of oxygen gas do your lungs contain at 37 ˚C and 100 kPa?
In this section, you will learn more about two properties of a gas that
are closely related to molar volume: density and molar mass. You havealready encountered these properties, but now you will use them to helpyou with your gas calculations.Figure 12.9
Applications of
the Ideal Gas Law
As you breathe in, your
diaphragm moves down andyour rib cage moves out toincrease the volume of yourlungs. As the volume increas-es, the air pressure in yourlungs decreases. Air from theoutside rushes in to ﬁll the
expanded volume. This is anapplication of Boyle ’s law. In
the same way, your lungsdecrease in volume when youexhale. The resulting increasein pressure pushes air out ofyour lungs.BiologyLINK
490 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryDensity and Molar Mass
As you learned in the last section, the molar volume of a gas is de ﬁned as
the space that is occupied by one mole of the gas. It is always given inunits of L/mol.
The density of a gas is similar to the density of a solid or a liquid.
Density is found by dividing mass by volume. The density of a gas is usually reported in units of g/L.
The molar mass of a gas refers to the mass (in g) of one mole of the
gas. You can calculate molar mass by adding the masses of atoms in theperiodic table. You can also calculate molar mass by dividing the mass ofa sample by the number of moles that are present. Molar mass is alwaysexpressed in the units g/mol. Table 12.2 summarizes molar volume, density, and molar mass.
Table 12.2 Molar Volume, Density, and Molar Mass
Dense Gases Can Be Deadly
You have learned that the volume of a gas at a certain temperature and
pressure is the same as the volume of any other gas at the same tempera-ture and pressure. For example, all gases have the approximate volume of 22.4 L at STP. The molecular masses of different gases, however, are all
different. This means that each gas has a different density, or mass perunit of volume. (Look back at Figure 12.7 to see three examples.)
Understanding the densities of gases can be useful in the everyday
world. For example, miners who drill deep into the ground must knowwhich gases are present, and which have the highest densities. (See
Figure 12.10.) They must take appropriate safety precau-tions to avoid explosions, poisoning, or suffocation.
On December 3, 1984, an industrial accident in
Bhopal, India, released a large quantity of methyliso-cyanate, CH
3NCO , a dense gas, into the air. This highly
irritating and toxic gas caused the death of more than3000 people living nearby. The Chemistry Bulletin onthe next page gives an example of a natural disasterinvolving a dense gas. Figure 12.11, on page 492, illustrates a popular use for gases that are less densethan air.Molar volume Molar mass

you do not become confused!Always check to make surethat you understand what Mis referring to.
Molar volume (L/mol), density
(g/L), and molar mass (g/mol)are closely related. You cancalculate each property usingthe other two. Analyze theunits to discover the exactrelationship.
Dense gases sit at the bottoms of pits, such as
mines and wells. Miners must understand the behaviour of thesegases to avoid accidents. For example, dense carbon dioxide gascan cause suffocation.Figure 12.10
The Killing Lakes of Cameroon
On August 15, 1984, a cloud of deadly gas
burst from Lake Monoun in Cameroon, a coun-try in western Africa. Thirty-seven people diedfrom suffocation. Two years later, on August21, 1986, Lake Nyos, a larger and deeper lake,ejected a full cubic kilometre of the same gas.The gas travelled silently into neighbouring vil-lages, killing 1700 people and thousands oflivestock. What was this toxic gas?
Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun both sit in
volcanic craters. The lakes are hazardousbecause of their volcanic origin, even thoughboth volcanoes are dormant. Volcanoes arevents through Earth ’s crust. They carry magma ,
a mixture of molten rock and dissolved gases,to the surface of Earth. When magma rises toEarth ’s surface in volcanoes, the pressure is
decreased. The gases come out of solution andexpand.
Magma contains a large quantity of dis-
solved carbon dioxide and minerals. These arereleased from the magma into the ground waterunder a volcano ’s crater. Lake Nyos and Lake
Monoun are both fed at the bottom by volcanicsprings of mineral-rich carbonated groundwater. In some crater lakes, there is enoughwater circulation for the carbon dioxide to bub-ble up from the bottom and be released at thesurface. The surface waters of Lake Nyos andLake Monoun, however, do not mix with deep-er waters. The carbon dioxide remains at thebottom. Volcanic springs continue to supplythe lakes with carbon dioxide, which remains
trapped at the bottom. Fresher surface watersits on this dense lower layer.
Scientists believe that the tragedies at Lake
Nyos and Lake Monoun were caused by a dis-ruption of the water layers, perhaps triggeredby a landslide, an earthquake, or even a strongwind. Lower carbonated water was suddenlyreleased into the upper water. As it moved upto the surface, the pressure on the gasdecreased while the temperature increased. Asa result, the carbon dioxide gas rapidly bub-bled out of solution. At Lake Nyos, the suddenrelease of the lower lake water into the upperlayers caused a plume of water and gas to risehigh into the air.
How did this massive release of carbon
dioxide cause so many deaths? Carbon dioxidegas is one-and-a-half times as dense as air. It sinks to the ground and displaces the oxy-genated air we need to breathe. The invisible,odourless carbon dioxide that was releasedfrom Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun settled on the ground. It travelled rapidly down theslopes into populated regions. People quicklybecame unconscious and died of suffocation.
Carbon dioxide continues to accumulate at
the bottoms of both lakes. An internationalteam of scientists is developing a plan torelease this carbon dioxide by controlleddegassing. They plan to insert long pipes deepinto both lakes and suck up some of the densebottom water. This will create a pressure differ-ence and cause a fountain of gas-rich water tojet from the pipes.

Many chemical reactions in everyday life involve gases. Figure 12.14
shows a common reaction that has a gas as a reactant. Other reactions,such as the electrolyzation of salt to give chlorine gas, have gases as products. To carry out an accurate and ef ﬁcient reaction, scientists must
know the number of moles of all the reactants. When one or more of thereactants is a gas, this means using the ideal gas law.
In this photograph, oxygen gas reacts with calcium to produce
calcium oxide.
You have already learned that the ideal gas law can be used to solve for
different variables in several different types of situations. As you mayrecall, the term “stoichiometry” refers to the relationship between the
number of moles of the reactants and the number of moles of the productsin a chemical reaction . In this section, you will learn how to use

and the products, measured at equal temperatures and pressures, arealways in whole number ratios . As well, you learned that the mole ratios
from a chemical equation are the same as the ratios of the volumes of the gases.
This information will help you with a certain type of gas stoichio-
metry problem. When a gas reacts to produce another gas, you can use Gay-Lussac ’s law of combining volumes to ﬁnd the volumes of the gases.
The following Sample Problem shows you how.Figure 12.14

Earlier in this course, you learned how to do stoichiometry calculations.
To solve gas stoichiometry problems, you will incorporate the ideal gaslaw into what you learned previously. The following steps will help youdo this.
Using the Ideal Gas Law for the Gaseous Product of a Reaction
The best way to ﬁnd out how to do a stoichiometry problem using the
ideal gas law is to study an example. In the following Sample Problem,you will use a balanced equation and the ideal gas law to ﬁnd the volume
of a gas produced. (Refer to Chapter 4, section 4.1, if you want to reviewhow to write balanced equations.)How to Solve Gas Stoichiometry Problems
1.Write a balanced equation for the reaction.
2.Write the given information under the appropriate reactants and
products. Put a question mark under the reactant or product forwhich information is needed.
3.Convert all amounts to moles.
4.Compare molar amounts using stoichiometry ratios from the balanced equation. Solve for the unknown molar amount.
5.Convert the new molar amount into the units required. You maymultiply by a conversion factor, or use a set of conditions with the ideal gas law, PV=nRT.

Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 507Including Water Vapour Pressure in Gas Calculations
You can collect many gases by allowing them to bubble up
through water into a container that is ﬁlled with water. (See
Figure 12.16). This is the method your teacher used to collect the gas in Investigation 12-A. Unfortunately, molecules of watervapour mix with the gas sample. To avoid error, the pressure thatwas contributed by the water vapour must be subtracted whenﬁnding the pressure of the gas.
As an example, consider hydrogen gas, which is often
collected over water. The hydrogen that is collected is a mixtureof hydrogen and water vapour. As you learned from Dalton ’s law
of partial pressures in Chapter 11, the pressure of this mixture is
P
total=Phydrogen+Pwater vapour
To ﬁnd the partial pressure of dry hydrogen, subtract the pressure
of the water vapour from the total pressure.
Phydrogen=Ptotal−Pwater vapour
The pressure of the water vapour is the same for any gas that is collected
at a particular temperature. For example, the pressure of water vapour at25˚C is 3.17 kPa. Table 12.3 gives the pressure of water vapour at different
temperatures.
When using the ideal gas law for a gas collected over water, you
must correct the pressure before you substitute it into the gas law. The following Sample Problem shows you how to do this.

Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 515It is a warm summer weekend, so you decide to visit a national park. It is
nice to be away from all that pollution. But are you bringing the pollutionwith you? Take a look at Figure 12.18. How did these campers get to thepark? Cars and buses release gaseous pollution into the air. On the otherhand, what would it be like to live without vehicles? Can we compromisein a way that protects the environment while maintaining a reasonablestandard of living?
These campers are enjoying the environment, but they are harming it at
the same time. How?
Fortunately many people are now aware of issues such as pollution
from car exhaust and ozone depletion. At the same time, Canadian chemi-cal and related industries employ about 250 000 people and generate tensof billions of dollars annually. These industries make the products thatentertain, feed, clothe, and keep Canadians comfortable. When discussingatmospheric chemistry and pollution, we must consider two importantinﬂuences: the economy and the environment.
In this section, you will look at the chemistry that takes place among
the gases in the atmosphere. You will examine an important gas calledozone and the pollutants that affect this gas.
Gas Chemistry in the Atmosphere
Many important chemical reactions take place in the atmosphere. Allthese reactions involve gases. There are two main types of gas chemistryin the atmosphere: •interactions between gases already present in the atmosphere
•interactions between atmospheric gases and gases produced by
processes on Earth Figure 12.18
Atmospheric Reactions
and Pollution
516 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryThe Ozone Cycle
High in the atmosphere, a gas called ozone, O3, absorbs ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from the Sun. The radiation separates the ozone into oxygen gas,
O2, and an oxygen atom. After passing through a few more steps, ozone
is re-formed when molecules of oxygen gas combine with oxygen atoms.By absorbing energy from the Sun in this way, ozone prevents harmful UV radiation from reaching Earth ’s surface. Figure 12.19 illustrates the
cycle that occurs as ozone is formed, absorbs UV radiation, and breaks up.Figure 12.20 shows where ozone is located in the atmosphere.
The ozone cycle: (A) Oxygen gas in the atmosphere absorbs energy from
the Sun. Each oxygen molecule breaks up into two oxygen atoms. (B) An oxygen atomcombines with a molecule of oxygen gas to form ozone. Another molecule is needed toabsorb extra energy. (C) Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and breaks up again intooxygen gas and an oxygen atom.
Pollutants in the Atmosphere
Gases from living and non-living processes on Earth ’s surface interact
with the gases in the atmosphere. For example, oxygen and carbon diox-ide in the air are involved in animal and plant respiration. A forest ﬁre
burns plants to produce carbon dioxide gas. On a more damaging level,human technology and industrial processes produce many pollutinggases. As you will learn in Chapter 14, burning fossil fuels is a majorsource of gas pollution in the atmosphere.
Chloro ﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) are an important class of polluting gases
that are not usually caused by burning fossil fuels. CFCs are stable andharmless near the ground. When they make their way up into the atmos-phere, however, they interact and interfere with atmospheric processes. Inparticular, these gases interfere with the production and reactions ofozone, O
3. You will learn more about CFCs later in this section.
Ozone Near the Ground
Ozone does not only exist high up in the stratosphere. It is also present
much closer to us, in the troposphere : the layer of the atmosphere that
lies directly over Earth. Ozone near the ground is largely produced when nitrogen oxide gas from car and truck exhaust fumes reacts withoxygen gas in sunlight. Ozone is a major component of smog in cities.(See Figure 12.21.) Figure 12.19

originally de ﬁned as a mixture
of smoke and fog. Today it canalso be photochemical, caused by sunlight breaking down airpollutants.Figure 12.21
Careers in Chemistry
Environmental Technician
Gases in the atmosphere (such as carbon
dioxide and methane) allow heat from the Sun to enter the atmosphere and prevent it from leaving again. This is called the greenhouse
effect . Thanks to the greenhouse effect, Earth
remains fairly warm, with an average tempera-ture of about 15.5 ˚C. Without this effect, Earth ’s
temperature would be about
−18˚C.
Human activities over the last hundred
years have caused the level of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere to increase.As a result, more heat is trapped in Earth ’s
atmosphere. According to Environment Canada,Canada ’s average temperature has risen by about
1˚C over the last century. This is causing more
frequent and more intense winter storms.
Change from the Ground Up
How can we decrease the production of green-house gases? One way is to focus on the sourcesof these gases. As global warming increases,chemists who study atmospheric processes willbe more in demand.
Change begins with accurate measurements.
Environmental technicians assess and monitorpollution levels in air, water, and soil. To becomean environmental technician, you need a highschool diploma, with advanced-level credits inmathematics, English, and science (preferably
chemistry or physics). You also need a two- orthree-year community college program in environmental technology.
Environmental technicians gather gas samples from
smokestacks and PCBs from transformers. They also setup equipment in the ﬁeld to create baseline studies and
monitor changes in the environment.
Make Career Connections
Human Resource Development Canada has
ofﬁces in every province. It also has a web
site where you can access descriptions andrequirements for many careers, including that of environmental technician. What otherenvironmental career opportunities can you locate? Prepare a brief report of your ﬁndings,
and present it to the class.
Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 517CFCs and Ozone Depletion
As you learned earlier, chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that
interfere with the ozone cycle high up in the atmosphere. CFCs are non-toxic, non ﬂammable compounds that contain atoms of chlorine, carbon,
and ﬂuorine. These gases are human-made compounds that were released
into the atmosphere primarily from refrigeration and aerosol devices.
In 1928, Thomas Midgley invented the ﬁrst CFC compound. Because
they were useful but safe, they were referred to as “miracle compounds. ”
In particular, dichlorodi ﬂuoromethane, CCl
2F2, also known as Freon, was
discovered to be an ef ﬁcient refrigerant.At this level, ozone is a pollutant with a harsh odour. In humans and
animals, it causes respiratory problems, including coughing, wheezing,and eye irritation. It retards plant growth, reduces the productivity ofcrops, and damages forests. Concentrations of ozone as low as 0.1 ppm(parts per million) can decrease photosynthesis by 50%. In addition, itdamages plastics, breaks down rubber, and corrodes metals.
Because of Freon, household refrigeration became common. In fact, much
of our modern-day life style ﬁrst became possible because of CFCs.
By 1974, millions of tonnes of CFCs had been produced (see Figure 12.22).At the University of California, chemists F. Sherwood Rowland and MarioMolina began to wonder where all of these CFCs ended up. They realizedthat CFCs are chemically very stable. However, they began to calculatewhat happens when CFCs are exposed to high levels of radiation far up inthe atmosphere. As it turned out, their fears were well-founded. In 1985,British scientists in the Antarctic noticed a large decrease in the ozonelayer above the Antarctic. A “hole” in the ozone layer was beginning to
form. In 1995, Rowland and Molina, along with a third ozone scientist,won the Nobel Prize for their work with CFCs.
How CFCs Attack Ozone
Today we know that CFCs high in the atmosphere break apart under
ultraviolet radiation to produce chlorine atoms. These chlorine atomsdestroy ozone molecules.
Cl+O
3→ClO+O2
The product, ClO, reacts with an oxygen atom and releases the chlorine
atom. The chlorine atom attacks another ozone molecule. Over time, onechlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. Figure 12.23illustrates this process for the CFC trichloro ﬂuoromethane, CCl
3F.
Eventually the chlorine atom reacts with a different compound in theatmosphere to form a stable, less harmful product.
518 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry
CFCs have been
used as refrigerants, coolants in home and automobile air conditioners, and propellants in aerosol containers such as hair sprays.Figure 12.22

E D
The breakdown of a CFC by ultraviolet radiation produces single chlorine
atoms that attack and destroy ozone. Because the chlorine atoms are released, theyattack ozone again and again in a chain reaction.
Although they are the most abundant ozone-depleting substance, CFCs
are not the only culprits. Other chemicals that damage the ozone layerinclude methyl bromide, CH
3Br, carbon tetrachloride, CCl 4, and halons
such as carbon tri ﬂuorobromide, CF3Br.Figure 12.23
Chapter 12  Exploring Gas Laws • MHR 519The Effects of Ozone Depletion
How do we know that CFCs and other ozone-destroying
molecules are having an effect on the atmosphere? AsFigure 12.24 illustrates, ozone levels over Canada andother parts of the world have decreased signi ﬁcantly
since the late 1970s.
With reduced ozone levels, more ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun reaches Earth. Amonghumans, UV-induced skin cancer and eye damageare becoming a serious threat. The increased levelsof radiation also damage phytoplankton in freshand marine ecosystems. Since phytoplankton arethe base of the aquatic food chain, this damageaffects all other water species. As you learned earlier, the presence of ozone close to Earth damages
crops and forests. A lack of ozone in the atmosphere,
however, also reduces the yield of crops, such as barleyand canola, and harms forests.
Improving Air Quality
What has happened since the discovery that CFCs and other chemicalswere harming the ozone layer? The chemical industry has invented andproduced environmentally friendly refrigerants. All new cars produced in North America have air conditioners that contain ozone-friendly refrigerants. Used CFCs from older refrigeration units are being recycledso that they do not escape into the atmosphere. A lot has already beenaccomplished, but more remains to be done.
Much of the positive activity comes from an international agreement
called the Montréal Protocol . This agreement was signed in Montr éal,
Canada, on September 16, 1987. It has been successful in drasticallyreducing the use of CFCs worldwide. The Montr éal Protocol is particular-
ly signi ﬁcant because, for the ﬁrst time, individual countries put a
common planetary goal ahead of their own economic interests.
The Montr éal Protocol stated that the production and consumption
of all substances that deplete the ozone layer would be phased out by theyear 2000 in developed countries. (Methyl chloroform would be phasedout by 2005.) The chemicals that are named in the agreement includeCFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and methyl bromide. Once CFC production and consumption are stopped, scientistshope that the ozone layer will recover within 50 or 60 years. The successof the Montr éal Protocol depends however, on the co-operation of both
developed and developing countries.
Section Wrap-up
In this section, you learned how ozone high in the atmosphere interactswith UV light from the Sun. In addition, you learned where CFCs comefrom, and how they damage the ozone layer. Finally, you saw that theMontr éal Protocol is striving to prevent further ozone damage. In 1993, a scienti ﬁc link was
established between ozonedepletion and increases inultraviolet radiation. It wasfound that increased exposureto UV-B radiation causes skin cancer, the formation ofcataracts, and the suppressionof the human immune system.Research has shown skin cancer to be as common as all other types of cancer com-bined. Sunscreens can protecthumans from the risk of someskin cancers. Unfortunatelythey do not appear to provideprotection against damage tothe immune system. FACTCHEMOzone thinning is
still occurring over the northernhemisphere, as shown here. Thedark blue in the centre indicatesthe presence of an ozone “hole. ”Figure 12.24

One of Dr. Ariya ’s particular areas of interest is
halogen chemistry. Halogens such as chlorine, Cl,and bromine, Br, occur naturally in ocean waters.As well, they enter ocean waters as run-off fromhuman activities. The oceans emit these halogens
into the atmosphere. There they react with, anddestroy, ozone, O

Ariya and her students are trying to deter-
mine what kinds of halogens exist in Earth ’s
atmosphere, how quickly they are produced anddegraded, and what their major sources are. Asthey ﬁnd answers to these questions, they may
be able to recommend ways to reduce halogensin the oceans and atmosphere. They may alsodevelop ways to modify halogens ’ reactions with
ozone and other gases so that the halogens doless harm.

524 MHR • Unit 4  Gases and Atmospheric ChemistryThe Costs of
Getting Around
Many people blame the government for not enforcing
sufﬁcient regulations to protect and clean up the envi-ronment. New, cleaner technologies have been devel-oped by science. Why don’t we use them? The fact is,Canadians are accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle,and may not be willing to change it. How would youfeel about stricter government regulations that affectedyour transportation and recreation?
Background
People have always turned to the cheapest and
most efﬁcient technologies. In the last few centuries,fossil fuels such as coal and oil were discovered inlarge amounts. These fuels were also very efﬁcient,producing large amounts of energy. It is only recentlythat we have become aware of the environmental consequences of our use of fossil fuels.
Today, we are attempting to reduce environmental
harm. Coal- and oil-burning engines have beenreplaced by cleaner gas-burning engines. Many enginesare equipped with “scrubbers” that help remove toxinsbefore releasing gases into the atmosphere. Most envi-ronmental problems have not been solved, however.Automobile emissions are one of our most seriousenvironmental problems today.
Automobiles expel an enormous amount of
toxins into the air every day. Besides harming theenvironment, these toxins are also dangerous tohuman health. It is estimated that many cases of bron-
chitis, asthma, and even early death could be eliminat-ed, by removing sulfur from fossil fuels before burningthem. This process is possible, but it costs money.Ultimately, these additional costs would be paid bythe consumer—you!
Often, Canadians do not appreciate or approve of
government efforts to reduce automobile emissions.Some people were angry when, decades ago, the gov-ernment asked them to switch to unleaded gasoline.Even now, many people remove factory-installed, pollution-reducing resonators and catalytic convertersfrom their new cars. They do this in an effort toincrease the power of their vehicles.
Environment Canada has copious amounts of
research suggesting that reducing automobile emis-sions would improve the health of Canadians. Therestrictions that would make these improvements,however, have not yet been enforced. For example,motorboats can be equipped with motors that are near-ly silent and that do not dump oil into the water.Because these cleaner, quieter motors are more expen-sive, most boaters still use the old cheaper motors.
To what extent should individuals be allowed
to make such choices? Should the good of the community and the overall environment have a higherpriority than personal choice?
Plan and Present
As a class, you will debate the following proposal:
All vehicles must meet strict environmentally-
friendly emissions standards. Any vehicles, new orold, that do not meet these standards must not be useduntil they are upgraded to the new emission stan-dards. Individual owners must pay for this upgrading.Those individuals who cannot afford to upgrade theirvehicles will be obliged to rely on public transportation .
Unit 4 An Issue to Analyze • MHR 525There are many angles to this issue. You may wish
to consider motorboat engines, private vehicles, com-mercial vehicles such as transport trucks, and thedevelopment and availability of public transportation.

(c)a commercial truck driver who uses thousands oflitres of fuel each week
(d)a used-car salesperson
(e)an autoworker
Write a counterpoint or amendment to the
resolution in order to respond to each of the comments in your answer to question 2.
Research the facts behind this situation. Before you
start, brainstorm some speciﬁc questions toresearch. Some suggestions are given below.

Did you know that you have bark from a willow tree in your medicine
cabinet at home? The model at the bottom right of the opposite pageshows a compound that is found naturally in willow bark. This chemicalis called salicin. It is a source of pain relief for moose, deer, and other animals that chew the bark. For thousands of years, Aboriginal people inCanada and around the world have relied on salicin’s properties for thesame pain-relieving purpose.
The model at the bottom left of the opposite page shows a close
relative of salicin. Scientists made, or synthesized, this chemical near the
end of the nineteenth century. It is called acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). Youprobably know it better by its brand name, Aspirin ™.
Chemists refer to salicin, ASA, and more than ten million other
chemicals like them as organic compounds. An organic compound is a
molecular compound of carbon. Despite the tremendous diversity oforganic compounds, nearly all of them share something in common. Theyare structured from a “backbone” that consists of just two kinds of atoms:carbon and hydrogen.
Compounds that are formed from carbon and hydrogen are called
hydrocarbons . In this chapter, you will explore the sources, structures,
properties, and uses of hydrocarbons—an enormous class of compounds.As well, you will learn how scientists and engineers use the properties of hydrocarbons to produce a seemingly inﬁnite variety of chemicals and products.13.1 Introducing Organic

Specific Expectations  As stated in the chapter opener, an organic compound is a molecular com-
pound of carbon. There are a few exceptions to this deﬁnition, however.For example, scientists classify oxides of carbon, such as carbon dioxideand carbon monoxide, as inorganic. However, the vast majority of carbon-
containing compounds are organic.
Organic Compounds: Natural and Synthetic
Organic compounds abound in the natural world. In fact, you probably atesugar or starch at your last meal. Sugars, starches, and other carbohydratesare natural organic compounds. So are fats, proteins, and the enzymesthat help you digest your food. Do you wear clothing made from wool,silk, or cotton? These are natural organic compounds, too. So are the molecules of DNA in the nuclei of your cells.
Until 1828, the only organic compounds on Earth were those that
occur naturally. In that year, a German chemist named Friedrich Wohlersynthesized urea—an organic compound found in mammal urine—froman inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate. (See Figure 13.1.) This wasa startling achievement. Until then, chemists had assumed that only livingor once-living organisms could be the source of organic compounds. Theybelieved that living matter had an invisible “vital force.” According tothese early chemists, this vital (life) force made organic matter fundamen-tally different from inorganic (non-living) matter.
When Friedrich Wohler (1800–1882) synthesized urea, he wrote a letter
to his teacher. In his letter, he said, “I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys…Ammonium cyanate is urea.” About 20 years earlier, Wohler’s teacher,Jons Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848), had invented the system that distinguishes organicsubstances from inorganic substances.Figure 13.1
UreaCyanides (containing carbon
bonded to nitrogen, CN) andcarbides, (such as calciumcarbide, CaC
2) are compounds
that contain carbon, but scientists classify them asinorganic. The same is true ofcarbonates, such as sodiumhydrogen carbonate, NaHCO
3
(baking soda). Why are car-
bonate compounds inorganic,rather than organic, compounds?
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was
ﬁrst produced commerciallyunder the brand nameAspirin
by Frederick Bayer
and Company in 1897. Theword “aspirin” comes from“a,” for acetyl, and “spir,” forspirea. Spirea is a genus of
plants that is another naturalsource of salicylic acid.LanguageLINKIntroducing Organic Compounds
Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 535Polymers are a fundamental part of your life.
They also happen to be organic. Polymers are
long molecular chains that are made up of smaller molecular units called monomers. Natural polymers include cellulose (the “ﬁbre” in
your food) and DNA. Synthetic polymers includeplastics, polystyrene (see below), and the materialyou will produce in this activity.
Polystyrene is an example of a polymer.
Safety Precautions
Avoid inhaling the powdered borax. It may
cause an allergic reaction. Wash your hands after working with the putty.
Procedure
1.Measure about 45 mL of white glue into a 250 mL beaker. Add an equal amount of warmwater and a few drops of food colouring.
2.Measure 15 mL of solid borax into another 250 mL beaker. Add 60 mL of warm water. Stirfor about 2 min. Note: You may ﬁnd that not
all of the solid borax dissolves. This is all right.3.Pour 30 mL of the borax solution into the glue mixture. Then quickly and thoroughly stirthe mixture.
4.Remove the material from the beaker, and “experiment ” with it. Here are a few
suggestions. Record your observations.
•Hold the putty in one hand. Put your otherhand below the putty, and let the puttyslowly ooze into it.
•Pull the putty apart slowly.
•Pull the putty apart quickly.
•Try bouncing the putty.
5.If time permits, you may wish to try changingthe ratio of borax to glue to water. Test your results.
6.Dispose of any excess borax solution as directed by your teacher.
Analysis
1.Compare the properties of the starting materials with the properties of the product. Is the putty a solid or a liquid? Explain.
2.What practical applications for this productcan you think of?CH2CHCH 2CHCH 2CHMaking Polymer Putty Express Lab
During the mid-1850s, chemists synthesized other organic
compounds, such as methane and ethanol, from inorganic chemicals.Eventually chemists abandoned their vital-force ideas. We still use theterms “organic ” and “inorganic, ” however, to distinguish carbon-based
compounds from other compounds. For example, sugar is an organic compound since it is carbon based. Salt is inorganic since it contains no carbon.
During the last century, the number of synthetic (human-made)
organic compounds has skyrocketed. Chemists invent more than 250 000new synthetic organic chemicals each year . With almost endless varia-
tions in properties, chemists can synthesize organic compounds to makeproducts as diverse as life-giving drugs, and toys. Nearly all medicines,such as painkillers, cough syrups, and antidepressants, are based onorganic compounds. Perfumes, food ﬂavourings, materials such as rubber
and plastic, and fabrics such as nylon, rayon, and polyester are all organiccompounds as well.
The next ExpressLab gives you a chance to make one such product.
It is up to you to decide what purpose it could have.

12H22O11. It is the main sugar in the sap ofplants such as sugar beets and sugar cane.
Sucrose is related to glucose, C6H12O6, and
other sugars.
Lemieux continued his research at the
University of Ottawa, and then at the Universityof Alberta in Edmonton. He was especially inter-ested in how molecules “recognize ” each other
and interact in the human body. For example, different blood groups, such as group A andgroup B, are determined by carbohydrate mole-cules that differ by only a single sugar. The bodyis able to recognize these speci ﬁc sugars and
adapt its response to foreign substances, such as bacteria and transplanted organs.
Since it was hard to obtain natural samples of
the body sugars that Lemieux wanted to study, hefound ways to synthesize them. This was ground-breaking research. Seeing the practical applica-tions of his research, Lemieux was instrumentalin starting several chemical companies. Todaythese companies make products such as antibi-otics, blood-group determinants, and immunizingagents that are speci ﬁc to various human blood
groups. They also make complex carbohydratesthat absorb antibodies from the blood in order to prevent organ transplant rejection.
Lemieux and his wife had six children and a
number of grandchildren. With all that he hadaccomplished in life, Lemieux said, “My proudest
achievement is my family. ” His autobiography,
titled Explorations with Sugar: How Sweet It Was ,
was published in 1990.
The Origins of Hydrocarbons and Other Organic Compounds
Most hydrocarbons and other organic compounds have their origins deep
below Earth ’s present surface. In the past, as now, photosynthetic organ-
isms used energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water intooxygen and carbohydrates, such as sugars, starches, and cellulose. Whenthese organisms died, they settled to the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceanbeds, along with other organic matter. Bacterial activity removed most ofthe oxygen and nitrogen from the organic matter, leaving behind mainlyhydrogen and carbon.
Over time, the organic matter was covered with layers of mud and
sediments. As layer upon layer built up, heat and tremendous pressuretransformed the sediments into shale and the organic matter into solid,liquid, and gaseous materials. These materials are the fossil fuels —coal,
oil, and natural gas —that society depends on today. (See Figure 13.2.)Why does society depend on
fossil fuels? What are theyused for? In the CourseChallenge at the end of thisbook, you will investigate a different type of fossil fuel from an imaginary planet.COURSE
CHALLENGE
Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 537Ancient eras that had higher carbon dioxide concentrations, as well as
warmer climates, gave rise to abundant plant and animal life on land and under water.Over time, as these organisms died, the organic substances that made up their bodieswere chemically transformed into the materials known today as fossil fuels.
Sources of Hydrocarbons
Sources of hydrocarbons include wood, the products that result from
the fermentation of plants, and fossil fuels. However, one fossil fuel —
petroleum —is the main source of the hydrocarbons that are used for
fuels and many other products, such as plastics and synthetic fabrics.
Petroleum , sometimes referred to as crude oil, is a complex mixture
of solid, liquid, and gaseous hydrocarbons. To understand the importanceof petroleum in our society, you need to become better acquainted withhydrocarbons. Your introduction begins, in the next section, with carbon —one of the most versatile elements on Earth.

Specific Expectations  Representing Hydrocarbon
Compounds
Examine the three substances in Figure 13.3. It is hard to believe that they
have much in common. Yet each substance is composed entirely of carbonatoms. Why does the carbon atom lead to such diversity in structure? Whydo carbon compounds outnumber all other compounds so dramatically?The answers lie in carbon ’s atomic structure and behaviour.
Figure 13.4 outlines three key properties of carbon. Throughout this
section and the next, you will explore the consequences of each of theseproperties.
Each of these
substances is pure carbon. Whatmakes carbon a “chemical
chameleon? ”Figure 13.3
Properties of Carbon
Carbon has four bonding electrons. This electron
structure enables carbon to form four strong covalent bonds. As a result, carbon may bond to itself, as well as to many different elements (mainly hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, but also phosphorus, sulfur, and halogens such as chlorine).Carbon atoms can bond together to form a variety of geometrical structures. These
structures include straight chains, branched chains, rings, sheets, tubes, and spheres. No other atom can do this.Carbon can form strong single, double, and triple bonds with itself. This allows carbon to form long chains of atoms —something that
very few other atoms can do. In addition, the resulting compounds are fairly stable under standard conditions of temperature and pressure.
Three key properties of carbon Figure 13.4
Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 539Representing Structures and Bonding
You have written chemical formulas for inorganic compounds such as
ammonia, NH 3, and calcium carbonate, CaCO 3. As well, you have
represented these compounds using Lewis diagrams, and perhaps othermodels. Such compounds are fairly small, so they are easy to representusing these methods. Many organic compounds —such as methane, CH
4,
and ethanol, C2H6O—are also fairly small. With patience, you might even
ﬁgure out how to draw a Lewis diagram for cholesterol, C27H46O! Most
hydrocarbons and other organic compounds are quite large, however.They are also structurally complex. Therefore chemists have devised othermethods to represent them, as explained below.
Using Expanded Molecular Formulas to Represent Hydrocarbons
One method that chemists use to represent a large molecule is the
expanded molecular formula . This type of formula shows the groupings
of atoms, and it often gives an idea of molecular structure. For example,the chemical formula for propane is C
3H8. This formula tells you that
propane contains three carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms. It givesno clue, though, about the way in which the atoms are bonded together.
Propane ’s expanded molecular formula is CH
3CH2CH3. As you can see
from this formula, the expanded molecular formula gives a clearer idea ofatomic arrangement. It implies that a CH
3group is attached to a CH2
group, which is attached to another CH3group.
Writing expanded molecular formulas becomes more helpful when
you are dealing with larger hydrocarbons. For example, C6H14is a
component of gasoline. It is also used as a solvent for extracting oils from soybeans and other edible oil seeds. Depending on how the carbonand hydrogen atoms are bonded together, C
6H14can have any of the ﬁve
structural arrangements shown in Figure 13.5. Each arrangement has a different name.
Expanded molecular formulas for ﬁve structural arrangements of C6H14
Keep in mind that all ﬁve of these arrangements have the same chemical
formula: C6H14. Compounds that have the same formula, but different
structural arrangements, are called isomers . Hexane, for example, is one
isomer of C6H14. You will learn more about isomers as you study this
chapter.Figure 13.5CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3

of the arrangement of the carbon and hydrogen atoms in its ﬁve possible
isomers. You can use other methods as well, however, to represent hydro-carbons and other organic compounds. These methods are outlined below.
Using Structural Models to Represent Hydrocarbons
A structural model is a three-dimensional representation of the structure
of a compound. There are two kinds of structural models: ball-and-stick
models and space-ﬁlling models . Figure 13.6 shows ball-and-stick models
for the ﬁve isomers of C
6H14. Notice that they show how the carbon and
hydrogen atoms are bonded within the structures.The number of isomers of an
organic compound increasesgreatly as the number of carbon atoms increases. Forexample, C
5H12has three iso-
mers, C6H14has ﬁve isomers,
and C8H18has 18 isomers.

has over four billion isomers!FACTCHEM
C6H14can have any one of these ﬁve structural arrangements. How do the
ball-and-stick models compare with the expanded molecular formulas for C6H14? How
does each isomer differ from the rest?Figure 13.6

arrangement of the atoms in a compound. As well, it represents themolecular shape and the amount of space that each atom occupies withinthe structure.

Using Structural Diagrams to Represent Hydrocarbons
A structural diagram is a two-dimensional representation of the structure
of a compound. (In some chemistry textbooks, structural diagrams arecalled structural formulas.) There are three kinds of structural diagrams:complete structural diagrams , condensed structural diagrams , and line
structural diagrams . As you can see in Figure 13.8, each serves a speci ﬁc
purpose in describing the structure of a compound.
In the next investigation, you will have an opportunity to make your
own models of the isomers of several organic compounds.Figure 13.7
Comparing complete, condensed, and line structural diagrams Figure 13.8A complete structural
diagram shows all the atoms
in a structure and the way they are bonded to one another.Straight lines represent the bondsbetween the atoms.A condensed structural
diagram simpli ﬁes the presenta-
tion of the structure. It shows thebonds between the carbon atomsbut not the bonds between thecarbon and hydrogen atoms.Chemists assume that thesebonds are present. Notice howmuch cleaner and clearer this diagram is, compared with thecomplete structural diagram.A line structural diagram is
even simpler than a condensedstructural diagram. The end ofeach line, and the points at whichthe lines meet, represent carbonatoms. This kind of diagram givesyou a sense of the three-dimen-sional nature of a hydrocarbon.Note: Line structural diagrams
are used only for hydrocarbons,not for other organic compounds.

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 543Section Wrap-up
The names of the isomers of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds
are quite different from the names of inorganic compounds. For example,go back to the structural diagrams shown in Figure 13.8. They all repre-sent the same isomer of C
6H14. Its name is 2-methylpentane. Now look at
Figure 13.9. It shows the names and condensed structural diagrams for thefour other isomers of C
6H14. Why do these names look so different from
the names of inorganic compounds? Scientists have devised a systematicway to communicate all the possible atoms and structures for each organic compound —all in its name! In the next section, you will learn the
rules for naming hydrocarbons. You will also learn how to interpret theinformation that hydrocarbon names communicate.

Specific Expectations  Classifying Hydrocarbons
The name “aliphatic ”
comes from the Greek wordaleiphatos , meaning “fat.”
Early chemists found thesecompounds to be less densethan water and insoluble inwater, like fats. “Aliphatic ”
now refers to the classes ofhydrocarbons called alkanes,alkenes, and alkynes.LanguageLINKChemists group hydrocarbons and other organic compounds into the
categories shown in Figure 13.10. The International Union of Pure andApplied Chemistry (IUPAC) has developed a comprehensive set of rulesfor naming the compounds within each category. Using these rules, youwill be able to classify and name all the hydrocarbon compounds that youwill encounter in this unit.
The names that are based on the IUPAC rules are called systematic
names . During your study of organic chemistry, you will also run across
many common names for organic compounds. For example, the system-atic name for the organic acid CH
3CO2His ethanoic acid. You are probably
more familiar with its common name: vinegar.
This concept map illustrates a system for classifying organic compounds.
In this chapter, you will explore only part of the family of organic compounds —the
aliphatic hydrocarbons shown by the boldface type.
Alkanes
Alkanes are hydrocarbon molecules that are joined by single covalent
bonds. They are the simplest hydrocarbons. Methane, CH4, is the simplest
alkane. It is the main component of natural gas. Alkanes are aliphatic
hydrocarbons: organic compounds in which carbon atoms form chains
and non-aromatic rings.
Figure 13.11 on the next page compares the structural formulas of
methane and the next three members of the alkane family. Notice threefacts about these alkanes:
1.Each carbon atom is bonded to the maximum possible number ofatoms (either carbon or hydrogen atoms). As a result, chemists refer toalkanes as saturated hydrocarbons .
2.Each molecule differs from the next molecule by the structural unit
–CH2–. A series of molecules like this, in which each member increases
by the same structural unit, is called a homologous series .
3.A mathematical pattern underlies the number of carbon and hydrogen
atoms in each alkane. All alkanes have the general formula CnH2n+2,
where n is the number of carbon atoms. For example, propane has 3 carbon atoms. Using the general formula, we ﬁnd that
2n+2=2(3)+2=8
Thus propane should have the formula C
3H8, which it does. Figure 13.10Hydrocarbons

Properties of Alkanes
Alkanes (and all other aliphatic compounds) have an important physicalproperty. They are non-polar. As you know from Chapter 8, non-polarmolecules have fairly weak intermolecular forces. As a result, hydrocar-bons such as alkanes have relatively low boiling points. As the numberof atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule increases, the boiling pointincreases. Because of this, alkanes exist in a range of states under standard conditions. Practice ProblemsHow are these
two alkanes similar? How arethey different? Use the ideas andterms you have just learned tohelp you answer these questions.Figure 13.12

ing points of alkanes. Notice how the state changes as the size increases.
Table 13.1 Comparing the Sizes and Boiling Points of Alkanes
Naming Alkanes
The IUPAC system for naming organic compounds is very logical and
thorough. The rules for naming alkanes are the basis for naming the otherorganic compounds that you will study. Therefore it is important that youunderstand how to name alkanes.
Naming Straight-Chain Alkanes
Recall that carbon can bond to form long, continuous, chain-like struc-
tures. Alkanes that bond in this way are called straight-chain alkanes .
(They are also called unbranched alkanes .) Straight-chain alkanes are
the simplest alkanes. Table 13.2 lists the names of the ﬁrst ten straight-
chain alkanes.
Table 13.2 The First Ten Straight-Chain Alkanes
The root of each name (highlighted in colour) serves an important
function. It tells you the number of carbon atoms in the chain. The sufﬁx -ane tells you that these compounds are alkane hydrocarbons.

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 547Naming Branched-Chain Alkanes
The naming rules for straight-chain alkanes can, with a few additions,
help you recognize and name other organic compounds. You now knowthat the name of a straight-chain alkane is composed of a root (such asmeth-) plus a suf ﬁx (-ane). Earlier in the chapter, you saw the isomers of
C
6H14. Figure 13.13 shows one of them, called 2-methylpentane.
2-methylpentane
Notice four important facts about 2-methylpentane:
1.Its structure is different from the structure of a straight-chain alkane.
Like many hydrocarbons, this isomer of C6H14has a branch-like
structure. Alkanes such as 2-methylpentane are called branched-chain
alkanes . (The branch is sometimes called a side-chain .)
2.The name of this alkane has a pre ﬁx (2-methyl-) as well as a root
and a suf ﬁx. Many of the hydrocarbons you will name from now on
have a pre ﬁx.
3.This alkane has a single CH3unit that branches off from the main
(parent) chain of the compound.
4.There is another CH3unit bonded to a CH2unit at the right end of the
chain. This is not another branch . It is a bend in the parent chain.
Before continuing, refer to the ChemFact on page 543. Make sure that you understand why the CH
3unit is not another branch.
Rules for Naming Alkanes
The names of branched-chain alkanes (and most other aliphatic com-
pounds) have the same general format, as shown in Figure 13.14. This format will become clearer as you learn and practise the rules for naminghydrocarbons. To start, read the steps on the next page to see how 2-methylpentane gets its name.
2-methylpentane is a simple example of a branched hydrocarbon.
Later you will see more complicated examples.

alkane name do not tell youdirectly about the number ofhydrogen atoms in the com-pound. If you did not know themolecular formula of heptane,for example, how would you still know that heptanecontains 16 hydrogen atoms?
You are probably familiar with
the origins of some of the rootsthat are used for namingorganic compounds, especiallythe roots for naming alkaneswith ﬁve or more carbons. The
roots for the ﬁrst four alkanes
may be unfamiliar, however.Use a comprehensive diction-ary (one that gives informationabout word origins) to ﬁnd out
the meanings of the rootsmeth- through dec-.LanguageLINK
548 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyNaming 2-Methylpentane
The structure of an alkane can be much more complex than the structure
of 2-methylpentane. For instance, there can be many branches bonded tothe main chain, and the branches can be quite long. As a result, you needto know several other IUPAC rules for naming branched-chain alkanesand other aliphatic compounds.Put the complete compound name together in this general form:
preﬁx +root +sufﬁx. The name of the compound is
2-methyl +pent +ane =2-methylpentane.Step 4Identify the location of any branches
with numbers. Use the number of carbons in each branch to name it.
IYou name a branch based on theappropriate root name for thenumber of carbons it contains. Youchange the ending to –yl, however.
(IUPAC rules identify branches byusing the -yl ending.)IHere there is only one carbon.Instead of calling the branchmethane, you replace the -aneending with -yl. So the name forthis branch is methyl.
IYou also give the branch name anumber. The number indicateswhich carbon in the main chain itis bonded with. Here the branch isbonded with the number 2 carbonin the main chain. So the numeral2 is added to the pre ﬁx.
IYou now have the full pre ﬁx name
for the compound: 2-methyl.Step 3Identify any branches that are
present. Then number the mainchain from the end that gives thelowest number to the ﬁrst location
at which branching occurs.IThere is only one branch here.Since the branch is closer to theleft end of the molecule, you num-ber the carbon at the left end “1.”
Then you number the other mainchain carbons consecutively.Step 2Find the longest continuous chain
(the parent chain). It does not haveto be straight. The number of carbons in the parent chain formsthe root of the name.IThe parent chain for 2-methylpen-tane is not straight. It is bent.
IThere are ﬁve carbons in the
longest chain, as highlighted.Therefore the root of the name is -pent-.
ISince the compound contains onlysingle carbon-carbon bonds, thesufﬁx of the name is -ane.
ISo far, then, you have pentane as
part of the name.Step 1

550 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyDrawing Alkanes
As you learned earlier in this chapter, three kinds of diagrams can be used
to represent the structure of a hydrocarbon. The easiest kind is probablythe condensed structural diagram. When you are asked to draw a con-densed structural diagram for an alkane, such as 2,3-dimethylhexane, you can follow several simple rules. These rules are listed below. Afteryou have studied the rules, use the Practice Problems to practise youralkane-drawing skills.
Rules for Drawing Condensed Structural Diagrams
1.Identify the root and the suf ﬁx of the name. In 2,3-dimethylhexane,
for example, the root and suf ﬁx are -hexane. The -hex- tells you that
there are six carbons in the main chain. The -ane tells you that the
compound is an alkane. Therefore this compound has single carbon-carbon bonds only.
2.Draw the main chain ﬁrst. Draw it straight, to avoid mistakes caused
by a fancy shape. Do not include any hydrogen atoms. You will need to add branches before you ﬁnalize the number of hydrogen atoms on
each carbon. Leave space beside each carbon on the main chain towrite the number of hydrogen atoms later.
3.Choose one end of your carbon chain to be carbon number 1. Thenlocate the carbon atoms to which the branches must be added. Add the appropriate number and size of branches, according to the pre ﬁx in
the name of the compound. In this example, 2,3-dimethyl tells you that
there is one methyl (single carbon-containing) branch on the secondC C C C CC(c)

You have learned how the
non-polar nature of alkanesaffects their boiling point. This non-polarity also affectsanother physical property: thesolubility of alkanes in water.For example, the solubility of pentane in water is only
5.0×10
−3mol/L at 25 °C.
Hydrocarbon compounds, such as those found in crudeoil, do not dissolve in water.Instead they ﬂoat on the sur-
face. This physical propertyhelps clean-up crews minimizethe devastating effects of anoil spill.FACTCHEM

carbon of the main chain. It does not matter whether you place bothbranches above the main chain, both below, or one above and onebelow. The compound will still be the same.
4.Finish drawing your diagram by adding the appropriate number ofhydrogen atoms beside each carbon. Remember that each carbon has avalence of four. So if a carbon atom has one other carbon atom bondedto it, you need to add three hydrogen atoms. If a carbon atom has twoother carbon atoms bonded to it, you need to add two hydrogen atoms,and so on.

552 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyAlkenes
Did you know that bananas are green when they are picked? How do they
become yellow and sweet by the time they reach your grocer ’s produce
shelf or your kitchen? Food retailers rely on a hydrocarbon to make thetransformation from bitter green fruit to delicious ripe fruit. The hydrocar-bon is ethene. It is the simplest member of the second group of aliphaticcompounds: the alkenes.
Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds.
Like alkanes, alkenes can form continuous chain and branched-chainstructures. They also form a homologous series. As well, they are non-polar, which gives them physical properties similar to those of alkanes.
Alkenes are different from alkanes, however, in a number of ways.
First, their bonds are different, as indicated by their suf ﬁxes. As you
will recall, the -ane ending tells you that alkane compounds are joined bysingle bonds. The -ene ending for alkenes tells you that these compounds
have one or more double bonds . A double bond involves four bonding
electrons between two carbon atoms, instead of the two bonding electronsin all alkane bonds. Examine Figure 13.18 to see how the presence of adouble bond affects the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkene.
This diagram shows how an ethane molecule can become an ethene
molecule. The two hydrogen atoms that are removed from ethane often form hydrogengas,

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 553The general formula for an alkene is CnH2n. You can check this against
the next two members of the alkene series. Propene has three carbonatoms, so you would expect it to have six hydrogens. Butene has four car-bon atoms, so it should have eight hydrogens. The formulas for propeneand butene are C
3H6and C4H8, so the general formula is accurate. Note,
however, that the general formula applies only if there is one double bondper molecule. You will learn about alkenes with multiple double bonds infuture chemistry courses.
Properties of Alkenes
The general formula for alkenes implies that at least two carbon atoms in any alkene compound have fewer than four bonded atoms. As a result,chemists refer to alkenes as unsaturated compounds. Unlike saturated compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbons contain carbon atoms that can
potentially bond to additional atoms.
Unsaturated compounds have physical and chemical properties that
differ from those of saturated compounds. For example, the boiling pointsof alkenes are usually slightly less than the boiling points of similar-sizedalkanes (alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms). This differencereﬂects the fact that the forces between molecules are slightly less for
alkenes than for alkanes. For example, the boiling point of ethane is–89˚C, whereas the boiling point of ethene is –104˚C. On the other hand,
both alkenes and alkanes have a low solubility in water. Alkenes, like allaliphatic compounds, are non-polar.
The double bond in alkenes has important consequences for their
chemical properties. Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes. Forexample, alkenes react with halogens in the absence of light, but alkanesdo not.
The chemical reactivity of alkenes makes them a popular choice
among chemical engineers. For example, nearly half of the ethene usedindustrially is in the plastics industry. Beverage containers, boil-in-the-bagfood pouches, milk bottles, motor oil bottles, many toys, shrink-wrap, andplastic bags are all based on the small ethene molecule. (See Figure 13.19.)The ethene in these products undergoes a process called polymerization .
In polymerization, hundreds of ethene molecules are reacted and strungtogether to make long chains of molecules. Another alkene, propene,undergoes a similar process and thus increases the variety of possiblepolymers.
On the previous page, you learned that ethene is used to ripen fruit.
How does this work? When a fruit ripens, enzymes in the fruit begin toproduce ethene gas. The ethene is responsible for the colour change, aswell as the softening and sweetening that occur as the fruit ripens. Foodchemists have learned that they can suppress ethene production (anddelay ripening) by keeping fruits at a low temperature as they are transported. Once the fruits reach their ﬁnal destination, ethene can be
pumped into the fruit containers to hasten the ripening process. No wonder you can get such a variety of fresh fruit at the supermarket!
In the next investigation, you will use reactivity to identify saturated
and unsaturated compounds in some everyday products. Saturated andunsaturated compounds play an important part in healthy eating, as youwill discover.Plastics made

554 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyComparing the Reactivity
of Alkanes and Alkenes
Because of differences in reactivity, you can use
aqueous potassium permanganate, KMnO 4(aq),
to distinguish alkanes from alkenes. When thepermanganate ion comes in contact with unsatu-rated compounds, such as alkenes, a reactionoccurs. The permanganate ion changes to becomemanganese dioxide. This is shown by a colourchange, from purple to brown. When the per-manganate ion comes in contact with saturatedcompounds, such as alkanes, that have only single bonds, no reaction occurs. The colour ofthe permanganate does not change.Question
How can you use aqueous potassium permanganate in a test to identify unsaturatedcompounds in fats and oils?
Predictions
Predict whether each substance to be tested willreact with aqueous potassium permanganate. (Inpart, you can base your predictions on what youknow about saturated and unsaturated fats fromthe media, as well as from biology and healthclasses.)
Safety Precautions

556 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyNaming Alkenes
The names of alkenes follow the same format as the names of alkanes:
preﬁx + root + sufﬁx . The pre ﬁxes and the steps for locating and identify-
ing branches are the same, too. The greatest difference involves the doublebond. The suf ﬁx -ene immediately tells you that a compound has at least
one double bond. The rest of the necessary information —the location of
the double bond, and the number of carbon atoms in the main chain —is
communicated in the root. Follow the steps below to ﬁnd out how to
name the compound in Figure 13.20.
Naming 2-Ethyl-1-Butene
Use the formula pre ﬁx +root +sufﬁx to put the name together. The full
name of this compound is 2-ethyl-1-butene. Remember that a hyphen isplaced between numbers and letters, and commas are placed between consecutive numbers.Step 4To create the pre ﬁx, identify and
locate the branches with numbers.IIf there is more than one branch,remember to put the branches inalphabetical order.
IThere are two carbons in thebranch that is attached to thenumber 2 carbon of the mainchain. Therefore the pre ﬁx is
2-ethyl-. (Make sure that youunderstand why -ethyl is used.)Step 3Number the main chain from the end
that is closest to the double bond.
IHere you number the main chainfrom the right side of the chain.This ensures that the double bondgets the lowest possible positionnumber.IYou need the number that locatesthe double bond. Here the doublebond is between carbon number 1and carbon number 2. Whichshould you use? Logic and theIUPAC rules suggest that youshould use the lowest possiblenumber. Therefore the doublebond is located with the number 1.So the root and suf ﬁx of the name
are -1-butene.Step 2Find the longest continuous chain
that contains the double bond. (Thisstep represents the main differencefrom naming alkanes.)IThe main chain must contain thedouble bond, even though it maynot be the longest chain.
IHere it is possible to have a mainchain of ﬁve carbons. However,
this chain would not include thedouble bond. Instead, choose theshorter chain with only four car-bons. This chain includes the dou-ble bond. We now have part of theroot, along with the suf ﬁx: -butene.Step 1
According to many nutrition
scientists, foods that containdouble or triple bonds (unsaturated compounds) arehealthier for us than foods thatcontain single bonds (saturat-ed compounds). Research the implications of includingunsaturated and saturated fatsand oils in your diet. Use alibrary, the Internet, or anyother sources of information.Decide on a suitable format inwhich to present your ﬁndings.BiologyLINK

Figure 13.20
Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 557In 2-ethyl-1-butene, the double bond and the branch are near each other
on the carbon chain. What happens if the double bond is close to one endof the carbon chain, but the branches are close to the other end? Forexample, how would you name the compound in Figure 13.21?
The methyl branch is close to the right end of the main chain. The
double bond is close to the left end of the main chain. Therefore you need to follow the rule in step 2: the double bond has the lowest possible
position number . Now you can combine the name as follows:
•The 5-carbon main chain is numbered from the left. The double bond is
given the number 2 (because 2 is lower than 3). The root and the suf ﬁx
are -2-pentene.
•The pre ﬁx is 4-methyl- since there is a 1-carbon branch on the fourth
carbon of the main chain.
•The complete name is 4-methyl-2-pentene.
Although the compounds you have just named have different structural
formulas, they both have the same molecular formula: C
6H12. These
compounds are both isomers of C6H12! You worked with structural iso-
mers earlier in this chapter. You have seen that isomers can be made byrearranging carbon and hydrogen atoms and creating new branches. Nowyou will learn that isomers can also be made by rearranging double bonds.
Drawing Alkenes
You draw alkenes using the same method you learned for drawing alkanes. There is only one difference: you have to place the double bondin the main chain. Remember the valence of carbon, and be careful tocount to four for each carbon atom on the structure. (Figure 13.22 gives an example of another alkene, 2-methyl-2-butene.) Be especially carefulwith the carbon atoms on each side of the double bond. The double bondis worth two for each carbon!

558 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyCis-Trans (Geometric) Isomers
You have seen that isomers result from rearranging
carbon atoms and double bonds in alkenes. Anothertype of isomer results from the presence of a doublebond. It is called a cis-trans isomer (or geometric
isomer ). Cis-trans isomers occur when different
groups of atoms are arranged around the double bond.Unlike the single carbon-carbon bond, which canrotate, the double carbon-carbon bond remains ﬁxed.
Figure 13.23 shows one of the compounds you haveworked with already: 2-butene.
Remember these general rules:
•To have a cis-trans (geometric) isomer, each carbon in the double
bond must be attached to two different groups.
•In a cis isomer, the two larger groups are attached to each double
bond on the same side.
•In a trans isomer, the two larger groups are attached to each
double bond on opposite sides.
Like all isomers, cis-trans isomers have different physical and chemical
properties. For example, the cis-2-butene isomer has a boiling point of3.7˚C, while the trans-2-butene isomer has a boiling point of 0.9 ˚C.

Elastomer Technology: Useful or Harmful?
What do tires and chewing gum have in
common? They are both made of elastomers :
any substance you can pull or ﬂex. Elastomer
molecules can be crosslinked , or chemically
linked, to produce rubber that retains its shape.You can ﬁnd elastomers and/or rubber in many
everyday products, such as running shoes,tires, underwear, and bubble gum.
Elastomers are a type of polymer, or giant
molecule. To form a polymer such as an elas-tomer, many small molecules are connected toform a chain with thousands of repeatingunits.
Elastomer technology is useful in medicine.
Muscles and arteries contain giant molecules,called elastin , that make muscles and arteries
contract. Doctors can give arti ﬁcial arteries to
people with severe heart problems or other diseases. Unfortunately these arti ﬁcial arteries
do not last long enough. Can they be replacedby a new type of elastomer?
Judit Puskas
Dr. Judit Puskas holds Canada ’s ﬁrst Industrial
Research Chair in Elastomer Technology at theUniversity of Western Ontario in London,Ontario. She thinks that an elastomer calledpolyisobutylene , along with some of its deriva-
tives, looks promising. In the future, it may beused to make better arti ﬁcial arteries. It may
also be useful for other implants, since it canimitate the rubber-like properties of elastin. Although elastomers and rubber have many
helpful and useful properties, they can alsocause problems. For example, rubber is used tomake safe tires for cars, trucks, and other vehi-cles. These tires wear out and must be changedregularly. As a result, Canada and the UnitedStates accumulate 275 million used tires everyyear! What can be done with these used tires?
Scrap tires that are left in piles may catch
on ﬁre. Since tires usually burn with incom-
plete combustion, many dangerous and polluting gases are emitted into the environ-ment. In addition, burning tires can leak oiland aromatic hydrocarbons into the soil. Thus they can contaminate drinking water in the area.
Tire manufacturers try to reduce waste
by making tires that last longer. Unfortunately,when these durable radial tires break down,they disintegrate into small airborne particles,instead of large pieces as older tires do. This“tire dust ” contains latex rubber, which is an
allergen. As well, tire dust is small enough tobe breathed deeply into the lungs. Tire dustmay be one reason why asthma is becomingmore common in North America.
Since tires are made of hydrocarbons, scrap
tires can be used as a fuel source. Tire derivedfuel (TDF) is used in power plants, paper mills,and cement kilns. Environmentalists are con-cerned, however, that incomplete combustionmay result in the release of toxins.
Making Connections
A large company is proposing to build acement kiln to produce cement. It will usescrap tires as fuel. Divide the class into variousstakeholders, such as
•local citizens
•an environmental group
•the company
•the provincial ministry of the environment
•the owners of a scrap tire storage facility

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 559Chemistry Bulletin
560 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyAlkynes
Carbon and hydrogen atoms can be arranged in many ways to produce a
great variety of compounds. Yet another way involves triple bonds in thestructure of compounds. This bond structure creates a class of aliphaticcompounds called alkynes. Alkynes are aliphatic compounds that contain
one or more triple bonds.
Naming and Drawing Alkynes
Both double and triple bonds are multiple bonds. Therefore alkynes areunsaturated hydrocarbons, just as alkenes are. To name alkynes and drawtheir structures, you follow the same rules that you used for alkenes. Theonly difference is the suf ﬁx -yne, which you need to use when naming
alkyne compounds. Also, remember to count the number of bonds foreach carbon. An alkyne bond counts as three bonds.
As you might expect, the presence of a triple bond in alkynes makes
their physical and chemical properties different from those of alkanes andalkenes. A structure with a triple bond must be linear around the bond.(See Figure 13.24.) This means that the shapes of alkynes are differentfrom the shapes of alkanes and alkenes. As well, the triple bond makesthe molecule much more reactive —even more so than the double bond.
In fact, few alkynes occur naturally because they are so reactive.
Alkynes are similar to both alkanes and alkenes because they form a
homologous series. Alkynes have the general formula of C
nH2n−2. So, for
example, the ﬁrst member of the alkyne series, ethyne, has the formula
C2H2. (You may know this compound by its common name: acetylene.)
The next member, propyne, has the formula C3H4.CH CH3 C C CH3

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 561Cyclic Hydrocarbons
You have probably heard the term “steroid ” used in the context of athlet-
ics. (See Figure 13.25.) Our bodies contain steroids, such as testosterone (a male sex hormone) and estrone (a female sex hormone). Steroids alsohave important medicinal uses. For example, budesonide is a steroid that is used to treat asthma. One of the most common steroids is cholesterol. This compound is essential to your normal body functions,but it has been linked to blocked artery walls and heart disease, as well.
Steroids have also been associated with misuse, especially at the
Olympics and other sporting events. Some athletes have tried to gain anadvantage by using steroids to increase their muscle mass.
Steroids are organic compounds. Our bodies make steroids naturally.
Steroids may also be synthesized in chemical laboratories. What do the structures ofthese steroids have in common?
What do steroids have to do with hydrocarbons? Steroids are
unsaturated compounds. Although they are complex organic molecules,their basic structure centres on four rings of carbon atoms. In other words,steroids are built around ring structures of alkanes and alkenes.
Hydrocarbon ring structures are called cyclic hydrocarbons . They
occur when the two ends of a hydrocarbon chain join together. In order todo this, a hydrogen atom from each end carbon must be removed, just asin the formation of a multiple bond. (See Figure 13.26 on the next page.)Figure 13.25

562 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyYou should have no trouble recognizing cyclohexane as a member of
the alkane family. Notice, however, that cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexa-ne, have two fewer hydrogen atoms compared with other alkanes. Thusthey have the general formula C
nH2n. (This is the same as the general for-
mula for alkenes.)
Naming and Drawing Cyclic Hydrocarbons
To draw the structure of a cyclic hydrocarbon, use a line diagram in aring-like shape, such as the one shown in Figure 13.26. Each carbon-carbon bond is shown as a straight line. Each corner of the ring representsa carbon atom. Hydrogen atoms are not shown, but they are assumed to bepresent in the correct numbers.
How hexane, C6H14, can become cyclohexane, C6H12
Because of the ring structure, the naming rules for cyclic hydro-
carbons, including cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, are slightly differentfrom those for alkanes and alkenes. Below are four examples to illustratethe naming rules.
To draw cyclic hydrocarbons, start with the rules you learned for
drawing other types of compounds. To place multiple bonds and branches,you have the option of counting in either direction around the ring.
Naming Cyclic Hydrocarbons
Example 2:  When naming cyclic compounds, all carbon atoms in the ring
are treated as equal. This means that any carbon can be carbon number 1. In Figure 13.28, only one branch is attached to the ring. Therefore the carbon that the branch is attached to is carbon number 1. Because thisbranch automatically gets the lowest possible position number, no positionnumber is required in the name. Thus the name of this compound is methylcyclohexane.Example 1: You can still use the general formula: pre ﬁx +root +sufﬁx. In
Figure 13.27, there are only single carbon-carbon bonds. There are also ﬁve
corners (carbon atoms) in the ring, which is the main chain. Since there areno branches, the name of this compound is cyclopentane. Notice the addi-tion of cyclo- to indicate the ring structure.Figure 13.26CC

Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 563Example 4: In Figure 13.30, there is a double bond, represented by the
extra vertical line inside the ring structure. You must follow the same rules as for alkenes. That is, the double bond gets priority for the lowest number.This means that one of the carbon atoms, on either end of the double bond,must be carbon number 1. The carbon atom at the other end must be carbonnumber 2. Next you have to decide in which direction to count so that thebranch gets the lowest possible position number. In this compound, the carbon atom on the bottom end of the double bond is carbon number 1.Then you can count clockwise so that the methyl group on the top carbon of the ring has position number 3. (Counting in the other direction wouldgive a higher locating number for the branch.) The name of this structure is 3-methyl-1-cyclohexene.Example 3: When two or more branches are on a ring structure, each must
have the lowest possible position number. Which way do you count the carbons around the ring? You can count in either direction around the ring. InFigure 13.29, a good choice is to make the ethyl branch carbon number 1 andthen count counterclockwise. This allows you to sequence the branches inalphabetical order and to add the position numbers in ascending order. Sothe name of this structure is 1-ethyl-3-methylcyclohexane.

Specific Expectations  Is it possible to take hydrocarbons straight out of the ground and use them
as they are? Since the earliest recorded history, people have done justthat. In the past, people used crude oil that seeped up to Earth ’s surface
to waterproof boats and buildings. They also used it to grease wheels andeven dress the wounds of animals and humans. As well, people burnednatural gas, mainly to supply lighting for temples and palaces.
Today hydrocarbons are extracted from the ground at well sites, then
processed further at re ﬁneries. (See Figure 13.34.) The ﬁrst commercial oil
well in North America was located in southern Ontario ’s Enniskillen
Township. It began production in 1858. At that time, kerosene (which wasused to fuel lamps) was the principal focus of the young petroleum indus-try. Paraf ﬁn (for making candles) and lubricating oils were also produced,
but there was little demand for other hydrocarbon materials, such as gaso-line.
This oil re ﬁnery is in Clarkson, Ontario.
Reliance on hydrocarbons has increased substantially since the nineteenth
century. Our society now requires these compounds for fuel, as well as forthe raw materials that are used to synthesize petrochemicals.Petrochemicals are basic hydrocarbons, such as ethene and propene, that
are converted into plastics and other synthetic materials. Petroleum is thechief source of the petrochemicals that drive our cars and our economy.Petroleum is not a pure substance, however. Rather, petroleum is a com-plex mixture of hydrocarbons —mainly alkanes and alkenes —of varying
molecular sizes and states. Because petroleum is a mixture, its composi-tion varies widely from region to region in the world. An ef ﬁcient process
is essential for separating and collecting the individual, pure hydrocarboncomponents. Read on to learn about this process in greater detail.Figure 13.34

resources/Canada ’s land mass has expe-
rienced dynamic changes overtens of millions of years.Climatic conditions, along withthe deposition of countlessremains of organisms, createdthe areas in which petroleumis found today. These areas arecalled sedimentary basins .

with those of other petroleum-producing nations? Go to theweb site above to “tap” into

Chemistry 11 to ﬁnd out where

Fractional distillation is a process for separating petroleum into its
hydrocarbon components. This process relies on a physical property —
boiling point. Each of the hydrocarbon components, called fractions , has
its own range of boiling points. At an oil re ﬁnery, the separating (re ﬁning)
of petroleum begins in a large furnace. The furnace vaporizes the liquidcomponents. The ﬂuid mixture then enters a large fractionation tower.
Figure 13.35 outlines how the various hydrocarbon fractions are separatedin the tower. ( Note: The temperatures shown are approximate
boiling points for the hydrocarbon fractions.)
Perforated plates, which are ﬁtted with bubble caps, are placed at various
levels in the tower. As each fraction reaches a plate where the temperatureis just below its boiling point, it condenses and lique ﬁes. The liquid
fractions are taken from the tower by pipes. Other fractions that are stillvapours continue to pass up through the plates to higher levels.
Several plates are needed to collect each fraction. Heavier hydro-
carbons (larger molecules) have higher boiling points. They condense ﬁrst
and are removed in the lower sections of the tower. The lighter hydrocar-bons, with lower boiling points, reach the higher levels of the towerbefore they are separated.

Selected uses of petroleum fractions
Cracking was ﬁrst introduced in Sarnia, Ontario. This process uses heat to
break larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller gasoline molecules.Cracking is done in the absence of air and can produce different types ofhydrocarbons. For example, the cracking of propane can produce methaneand ethene, as well as propene and hydrogen. (See Figure 13.37.)
This chemical equation summarizes the cracking of propane. Figure 13.37propane methane ethene propene hydrogen2C H 3CH2CH3 CH4+CH2CH2+CH3CH CH 2+H2500˚C–700˚CFigure 13.36Cracking and Reforming
Once the fractions are removed from the distillation tower, they may
be chemically processed or puri ﬁed further to make them marketable.
(See Figure 13.36.) There has been a tremendous increase in the demandfor a variety of petroleum products in the early twentieth century. Thisdemand has forced the oil industry to develop new techniques to increasethe yield from each barrel of oil. These techniques are called cracking andreforming.
The Chemistry 11 Electronic
Learning Partner has an ani-mation that illustrates how afractionation tower works.Electronic Learning Partner
Chapter 13  The Chemistry of Hydrocarbons • MHR 571Reforming is another technique that uses heat, pressure, and catalysts to
convert large hydrocarbons into other compounds. Reforming can producelarger hydrocarbons or a different type of hydrocarbon, called aromaticcompounds. (See Figure 13.38.) Aromatic compounds contain special ringstructures. You will learn about them in a later chemistry course.
Comparing cracking and reforming
Some of the products of the re ﬁning process are transported to
petrochemical plants. These plants convert complex hydrocarbons,such as naphtha, into simple chemical compounds, or a smallnumber of compounds, for further processing by other industries.Canadian petrochemical plants produce chemicals such asmethanol, ethylene, propylene, styrene, butadiene, butylene,toluene, and xylene. These chemicals are used as building blocksin the production of other ﬁnished products. Nearly every room
in your school, your home, and your favourite shopping centrecontains, or is made from, at least one petrochemical product. Yet, as you can see in Figure 13.39, petrochemicals represent only a small fraction of society ’s uses of petroleum.
In the next chapter, you will discover why hydrocarbons are
so highly valued as fuels. As well, you will unravel the mystery of how so much energy can be locked up inside a hydrocarbonmolecule.

Careers in Chemistry
Polymer Chemist
Bulletproof vests used to be heavy, bulky, and
uncomfortable. Stephanie Kwolek changed that.Now police of ﬁcers, police dogs, and soldiers,
can wear light, strong bulletproof vests made of a synthetic ﬁbre called Kevlar ™. Kwolek (shown
above) developed Kevlar ™ while working for the
DuPont chemical company. Kevlar ™ ﬁrst came
into general use in 1971. It is ﬁve times stronger
than steel, gram for gram, but almost as light asnylon. It is ﬂame resistant, resists wear and tear,
and does not conduct electricity. This versatilematerial is used not only in bulletproof vests, butalso in other manufactured items, including hock-ey helmets, ﬁreﬁghters ’ suits, spacecraft shells,
and surgeons ’ gloves.
Kwoluk ’s branch of organic chemistry —poly-
mer chemistry —specializes in creating synthetic
materials that are cheaper, faster, and strongerthan natural materials. Polymer chemists oftenwork by stringing together thousands of atoms toform long molecules called polymers. Then theymanipulate these polymers in various ways.
Polymer chemists have invented an amazingarray of materials. These include polyvinyl chlo-ride (used to make garden hose and duct tape),polyurethane (used to stuff teddy bears and make spandex bicycle pants), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, or ABS (used to make brakesand other auto body parts).

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 577Energy Trapped
in Hydrocarbons
The whole world runs on energy—and so do you! Fossil fuels provide
energy to power cars and heat buildings. Food provides energy to keepyour body alive and warm. Both sources of energy come from organiccompounds, such as hydrocarbons, sugars, and proteins.
Green plants, algae, and plankton trap the Sun’s energy through the
process of photosynthesis. After these organisms die, they are brokendown by natural processes. Their remains accumulate on Earth’s surface.In some areas, these remains build up in thick layers, which are eventual-ly covered by rock and soil. Under certain conditions, over billions ofyears, pressure changes these layers into something new: fossil fuels.Fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum) are fuels that are
made from fossilized organic materials. The trapped energy from the Sunis still present in fossil fuels. To use this energy, we need to extract it.Combustion , or burning, is the most common way to extract energy from
fossil fuels.
In this chapter, you will explore the ways in which our society obtains
energy from fossil fuels. You will get a chance to measure exactly howmuch energy is obtained from an organic substance by doing your owncombustion reaction. As well, you will learn how dangerous incompletecombustion reactions can be.14.1 Formation and

Specific Expectations  One of our most common uses of hydrocarbons is as fuel. (See Figure
14.1.) The combustion of fossil fuels gives us the energy we need to traveland to keep warm in cold climates. Fossil fuel combustion is also animportant source of energy in the construction and manufacturing indus-tries. As well, many power plants burn natural gas when generating electricity. Even goldsmiths use hydrocarbons, such as butane, as a heatsource when crafting gold jewellery. At home, we often burn fossil fuels,such as natural gas, to cook our food.
How do we get energy from these compounds? In this section, you
will learn how complete and incomplete combustion can be expressed aschemical equations. Combustion in the presence of oxygen is a chemical
property of all hydrocarbons. (In Chapter 13, you learned about somephysical properties of hydrocarbons, such as boiling point and solubility.)Formation and
Combustion Reactions
How are fossil fuels being used in these photographs? Figure 14.1
Lamp Oil and the Petroleum Age
Abraham Gesner was born in 1797 near
Cornwallis, Nova Scotia. Although Gesnerbecame a medical doctor, he was much moreinterested in fossils. Gesner was fascinated byhydrocarbon substances, such as coal, asphal-tum (asphalt), and bitumen. These substanceswere formed long ago from fossilized plants,algae, ﬁsh, and animals.
When Gesner was a young man, the main
light sources available were ﬁre, candles, andwhale oil lamps. Gesner had made several trips to Trinidad. He began to experiment withasphaltum, a semisolid hydrocarbon fromTrinidad’s famous “pitch lake.” In 1846, whilegiving a lecture in Prince Edward Island, hestartled his audience by lighting a lamp thatwas ﬁlled with a fuel he had distilled fromasphaltum. Gesner’s lamp fuel gave more lightand produced less smoke than any other lampfuel the audience had ever seen used.
Gesner needed a more easily obtainable
raw material to make his new lamp fuel. Hetried a solid, black, coal-like bitumen fromAlbert County, New Brunswick. This sub-stance, called albertite, worked better than any other substance that Gesner had tested.
Making Kerosene
One residue from Gesner’s distillation processwas a type of wax. Therefore, he called hislamp fuel kerosolain , from the Greek word for
“wax oil.” He soon shortened the name tokerosene . To produce kerosene, Gesner heated
chunks of albertite in a retort (a distilling ves-sel with a long downward-bending neck). Asthe albertite was heated, it gave off vapours.The vapours passed into the neck of the retort,condensed into liquids, and trickled down intoa holding tank. Once Gesner had ﬁnished theﬁrst distillation, he let the tank’s contents standfor several hours. This allowed water and solidto settle to the bottom. Then he drew off the oilthat remained on top. Gesner distilled this oil again, and then
treated it with sulfuric acid and calcium oxide.Finally he distilled the oil once more.
By 1853, Gesner had perfected his process.
In New York, he helped to start the NorthAmerican Kerosene Gas Light Company.Gesner distinguished between three grades of kerosene: grades A, B, and C. Grade C, hesaid, was the best lamp oil. Grades A and Bcould also be burned in lamps, but they weredangerous because they could cause explosionsand ﬁres.
Although Gesner never knew, his grades
A and B kerosene became even more usefulthan the purer grade C. These grades were later produced from crude oil, or petroleum,and given a new name: gasoline!
Gesner laid the groundwork for the
entire petroleum industry. All the basics oflater petroleum reﬁning can be found in histechnology.
Making Connections
1.In the early nineteenth century, whales were hunted extensively for their oil, which was used mainly as lamp fuel. Whenkerosene became widely available, thedemand for whale oil decreased. Find outwhat effect this had on whalers and whales.
2.How do you think the introduction ofkerosene as a lamp oil changed people’s lives at the time? What conclusions can you draw about the possible impact of technology?
Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 579Chemistry Bulletin
580 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergySour gas, H2S(g), is
sometimes “ﬂared off” (burned)from an oil well. This combustionproduces sulfur dioxide gas,which reacts with the water inthe atmosphere to produce acidrain. Oil companies are now making an effort to reduce thistype of pollution.Figure 14.2
Complete and Incomplete Combustion
During a typical combustion reaction, an element or a compound reacts
with oxygen to produce oxides of the element (or elements) found in thecompound. Figure 14.2 shows an example of a combustion reactions.
Hydrocarbon compounds will burn in the presence of air to produce
oxides. This is a chemical property of all hydrocarbons. Complete
combustion occurs if enough oxygen is present. A hydrocarbon that
undergoes complete combustion produces carbon dioxide and watervapour. The following equation shows the complete combustion ofpropane. (See also Figure 14.3.)
C
3H8(g)+5O2(g)→3CO 2(g)+4H2O(g)
If you burn a fuel, such as propane, in a barbecue, you want complete
combustion to occur. Complete combustion ensures that you are gettingmaximum efﬁciency from the barbecue. More importantly, toxic gases can result from incomplete combustion : combustion that occurs when not
enough oxygen is present. During incomplete combustion, other products(besides carbon dioxide and water) can form. The equation below showsthe incomplete combustion of propane. Note that unburned carbon, C
(s),
and carbon monoxide, CO(g), are produced as well as carbon dioxide
and water.
2C3H8(g)+7O2(g)→2C(s)+2CO (g)+2CO 2(g)+8H2O(g)
Figure 14.4 shows another example of incomplete combustion.
Go back to the equation for the complete combustion of propane. Noticethat the mole ratio of oxygen to propane for the complete combustion (5 mol oxygen to 1 mol propane) is higher than the mole ratio for theincomplete combustion (7 mol oxygen to 2 mol propane, or 3.5 mol oxy-gen to 1 mol propane). These ratios show that the complete combustion of propane used up more oxygen than the incomplete combustion. In fact, the incomplete combustion probably occurred because not enoughoxygen was present. You just learned that incomplete combustion pro-duces poisonous carbon monoxide. This is why you should never operatea gas barbecue or gas heater indoors, where there is less oxygen available.This is also why you should make sure that any natural gas or oil-burningfurnaces and appliances in your home are working at peak efﬁciency, toreduce the risk of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide detectors area good safeguard. They warn you if there is dangerous carbon monoxidein your home, due to incomplete combustion.
Balancing Combustion Equations
Have you ever seen a construction workerusing an oxyacetylene torch? (See Figure14.6.) A brilliant white light comes fromthe torch as it cuts through steel. Theintense heat that is associated with thisﬂame comes from the combustion ofethyne, a very common alkyne. Ethyne is also known as acetylene .
The yellow ﬂame of
this candle indicates that incom-plete combustion is occurring.Carbon, C
(s), emits light energy in
the yellow wavelength region ofthe visible spectrum.Figure 14.4
Propane burning in a propane torch:
A blue ﬂame indicates that complete combustionis occurring.Figure 14.3
Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 581How do you write the balanced equation for the complete combustion of
acetylene (ethyne)? Complete hydrocarbon combustion reactions follow ageneral format:
hydrocarbon +oxygen →carbon dioxide +water vapour
You can use this general format for the complete combustion of any
hydrocarbon, no matter how large or how small. For example, both acetylene and propane burn completely to give carbon dioxide and watervapour. Each hydrocarbon, however, produces different amounts, or moleratios, of carbon dioxide and water.
You have seen, written, and balanced several types of reaction
equations so far in this textbook. In the following sample problem, youwill learn an easy way to write and balance hydrocarbon combustionequations.
Problem

What Is Required?
You need to write the equation. Then you need to balance the atomsof the reactants and the products.

The product coefﬁcients are now set. Therefore, count the total num-

You end up with an oddnumber of oxygen atoms on the product
side of the equation. When this happens, use a fractional coefﬁcientso that the reactant oxygen balances. Here you have
C
2H2(g)+5
2O2(g)→2CO 2(g)+H2O(g)
You may prefer to balance the equation with whole numbers. If so,
multiply everything by a factor that is equivalent to the denominatorof the fraction. Since the fractional coefﬁcient of O
2(g)has a 2 in the
denominator, multiply allthe coefﬁcients by 2 to get whole number
coefﬁcients.

The same number of carbon atoms appear on both sides of the
equation.

equation.

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 587In this section, you were introduced to the complete and incomplete com-
bustion of hydrocarbons. You learned that the complete combustion of ahydrocarbon produces water and carbon dioxide. You also learned thatthe incomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon produces additional prod-ucts, such as unburned carbon and dangerous carbon monoxide. In theinvestigation, you had the chance to make and combust a hydrocarbon.
In the next section, you will learn about an important factor of
combustion reactions: energy. The combustion of hydrocarbons producesa large amount of energy. This is why they are so useful as fuels. How canyou include energy as part of a combustion or other equation? How canyou calculate the energy released by fossil fuels? You will learn theanswers to these questions in the rest of this chapter.
What is the difference between incomplete and complete
hydrocarbon combustion reactions?
Explain why you would usually write (g) for the state of the
product water in these combustion reactions. When might you identifythe state of water as liquid?

Natural gas is mainly methane gas. If you have a natural gas
furnace, stove, or water heater in your home, you must ensure thatthese appliances are always running at peak ef ﬁciency. In other words,
the methane gas should undergo complete combustion so that carbonmonoxide is not produced. Write a balanced chemical equation to show the complete combustion of methane gas. Write a second balanced equation to show the incomplete combustion of methane gas.

Specific Expectations  In the last section, you learned about acetylene, an important fuel in our
society (Figure 14.6). You balanced the equation for the complete combus-tion of acetylene. You then produced acetylene in an investigation. Whatyou did not consider, however, was the most useful product that our soci-ety gets from acetylene: heat energy. How can you represent the heat thatis released during combustion as part of a chemical equation?
For now, you will use the word “energy ” to represent the heat in an
equation. In the next section, you will calculate numerical values for thisenergy and use these energy values in chemical equations.
In previous science courses, you studied reactions that involve a
change in energy. Figure 14.7 reviews some important terms.
An exothermic reaction gives off heat. Combustion reactions are
exothermic reactions because they produce heat. Since the energy is a
product of the reaction, it is shown on the product side of the equation .
The combustion of acetylene is a good example of an exothermic
reaction:
2C
2H2(g)+5O2(g)→4CO 2(g)+2H2O(g)+energy
When the energy is written as part of the chemical equation, the equation
is called a thermochemical equation .
An endothermic reaction absorbs heat energy. Energy must be added
to the reactants for an endothermic reaction to occur. Since the energy is
needed as a reactant, it is shown on the reactant side of the equation .
Have you ever noticed that perfume or rubbing alcohol feels cool on
your skin as it evaporates? The physical process of evaporation isendothermic. Energy is taken away from the surface of your skin, so youfeel cool. The energy is added to the liquid alcohol or perfume solvent tomake it a gas. The following equation shows the endothermic evaporationof isopropanol (a type of rubbing alcohol) from a liquid to a gas:

The combustion
of acetylene (ethyne) in an oxyacetylene torch produces the highest temperature (about3300 °C) of any known mixture
of combustible gases. Metalworkers can use the heat fromthis combustion to cut throughmost metal alloys.Figure 14.6
Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 589Bond Breaking and Bond Making
The formation of acetylene (ethyne) gas from its elements is an endother-
mic reaction. The combustion of acetylene, however, is exothermic. Infact, it releases enough heat energy to cut steel! How can you explain the formation and combustion of acetylene in terms of bonds being broken and made? The answer to this question is fundamental to yourunderstanding of the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions.
This illustration shows bonds being broken and made during a chemical
reaction. If the bonds are strong, there is a large change in energy. If the bonds areweak, there is a small change in energy.
A chemical bond is caused by the attraction between the electrons and
nuclei of two atoms. Energy is needed to break a chemical bond, just likeenergy is needed to break a link in a chain. On the other hand, making achemical bond releases energy. The strength of a bond depends on howmuch energy is needed to break the bond. (see Figure 14.8.)
A speci ﬁc amount of energy is needed to break each type of bond.
When the same type of bond is formed, the same speci ﬁc amount of
energy is released. The energy that is absorbed or released when breakingor making a bond is called the bond energy . Bond energy is usually
measured in kilojoules (kJ). Table 14.1 shows some average bond energies.
From the table, you can see that 347 kJ of energy is needed to break
one mole of C —C bonds in a sample of propane or any other carbon.
Similarly, 347 kJ of energy is released if one mole of C —C bonds forms in
a sample of butane.
Every chemical reaction involves both bond breaking (reactant bonds
are broken) andbond making (product bonds are formed). Since there are
different types of bonds inside the reactant and product molecules, thebond breaking and bond making energies are different. This results in anet amount of energy for each reaction.
The next sample problem compares bond breaking and bond making
in a combustion reaction.Figure 14.8energy energyenergy  energy

You have probably had plenty of experience with heating and cooling
materials around you. You know how to cool yourself by taking a coldshower. You know how to heat hot chocolate on a stove. However, haveyou ever stopped to think about what energy changes are occuring? Where does the energy come from, and where does it go?
Suppose that you are very thirsty, but the tap water is not cold enough.
How can you get the water as cold as you want it to be? Your experience tells you to addice to the water. How does the ice cool the water?
Any time that something is cooled or heated, a change in thermal energy
occurs. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of particles of matter. In a
glass of tap water with ice (as shown in Figure 14.9), the water started outwarmer than the ice. Energy was transferred from the water to the ice. Asthe ice absorbed the energy, the ice melted. As the water lost energy, thewater cooled.
These examples involve heat. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy
between objects with different temperatures. In this section, you willstudy how to measure the quantity of thermal energy that is transferredduring a process involving an energy change.
Important Factors in Energy Measurement
How can you measure the change in energy when you add ice to water?Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a system. You
have already had experience using a thermometer to measure temperature.By placing a thermometer in the water, you can monitor the drop in temperature when the ice is added. Temperature is an important factor in heat energy changes. What other factors are important? Work throughthe following ThoughtLab to ﬁnd out.Figure 14.9

Factors in Heat Transfer Thought Lab
The ThoughtLab gave you some insight into the factors that are important
when measuring energy changes. How can you use these factors to calcu-late the quantity of heat that is transferred? First you must examine eachfactor and determine its relationship to heat transfer. You will begin withthe most obvious factor: temperature. Then you will look at how the massof a substance affects the quantity of thermal energy it can store. Finally,you will look at the type of substance and how it affects heat transfer.
Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 595Temperature
In the summer, your body temperature is fairly close to the temperature of your surroundings. You do not need to wear extra clothing to keep warm. When winter hitswith ﬁerce winds and cold temperatures, however, dressing
warmly becomes a necessity. The temperature of your sur-roundings is now much colder than your body temperature.Heat is transferred from your body to your surroundings,making you feel cold. The extra clothing helps to minimizeheat loss from your body. (See Figure 14.10.)
Temperature is directly related to heat transfer. A large
change in temperature indicates a large energy change. A small change in temperature indicates a small energy change. Therefore, temperature is an important factor when calculating heat transfer. The temperature variable that is used is the change in temperature . This is symbolized by
∆T.
Mass of Substance
Did you know that 70% of Earth ’s surface is covered with water? This
enormous mass of water absorbs and releases tremendous amounts of heat energy. Water makes our climate more moderate by absorbing heat in hot weather and releasing heat in cold weather. The greater the mass of the water, the greater the amount of heat it can absorb and release.(Areas without much water, such as deserts, experience huge variations in temperature.) Therefore, mass is directly related to heat transfer. Massis a variable in the calculation of heat energy. It is symbolized by a lower-case m.
Type of Substance
In the ThoughtLab on page 594, you probably noticed that
the quantity of heat being transferred depends on the type of substance. When you added equal masses of ice to thesame mass of oil and water, the temperature change of theoil was almost double the temperature change of the water.“Type of substance ” cannot be used as a variable, however,
when calculating energy changes. Instead, we use a variable that re ﬂects the individual nature of different sub-
stances: speci ﬁc heat capacity. The speciﬁc heat capacity
of a substance is the quantity of energy, in joules (J), that isrequired to change one gram (g) of the substance by onedegree Celsius ( ˚C). The speci ﬁc heat capacity of a sub-
stance re ﬂects how well the substance can store energy.
A substance with a large speci ﬁc heat capacity can absorb
and release more energy than a substance with a smallerspeci ﬁc heat capacity. The symbol that is used for speci ﬁc
heat capacity is a lower-case c. The units are J/g ·˚C.
The speci ﬁc heat capacity of water is relatively large:
4.184 J/g ·˚C. This value helps to explain how water can
absorb and release enough energy to moderate Earth ’s tem-
perature. Examine the values in Table 14.2. Notice that thespeci ﬁc heat capacities of most substances are much lower
than the speci ﬁc heat capacity of water.

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 601How can you measure the energy in a substance?
In this unit, you have learned about the importance of hydrocarbons as
fuels. Hydrocarbons are useful because of the energy that is released whenthey burn. It is often necessary, however, to know the amount of energythat is released. For example, engineers need to know how much energy is released from different fuels when they design an engine and choose anappropriate fuel. Fire ﬁghters need to know how much heat can be given
off by different materials so they can decide on the best way to ﬁght a
speci ﬁc ﬁre. (See Figure 14.13.)
What about food —the fuel for your body? In order to choose an
appropriate and balanced diet, you need to know how much energy eachtype of food releases when it is digested. Food energy is measured inCalories. (You will learn more about Calories later in this section.)
How do you measure the quantity of energy that is produced? In this
section, you will focus on measuring heat changes. You will learn aboutsome technology and techniques to measure heat. You will then applywhat you have learned by performing your own heat experiments.
Calorimetry
In the ThoughtLab in section 14.3, two students used beakers with no lidswhen they measured change in temperature. The students assumed thatenergy was being exchanged only between the ice and the water. In fact,energy was also being exchanged with the surroundings. As a result, thedata that the students obtained had a large experimental error. How couldthe students have prevented this error?
Much of the technology in our lives is designed to stop the ﬂow of
heat. Your home is insulated to prevent heat loss in the winter and heatgain in the summer. If you take hot soup to school for your lunch, youprobably use a Thermos to prevent heat loss to the environment.
Whenever there is a temperature difference between two objects, thermal energy ﬂows from the hotter object to the colder object. When
you measure the heat being transferred in a reaction or other process, you must minimize any heat that is exchanged with the surroundings. Figure 14.13
The Technology of Heat
Measurement
602 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyTo measure the heat ﬂow in a process, you need an
isolated system, like a Thermos . An isolated system stops
matter and energy from ﬂowing in or out of the system. You
also need a known amount of a substance, usually water. Thewater absorbs the heat that is produced by the process, or itreleases heat if the process is endothermic. To determine theheat ﬂow, you can measure the temperature change of the
water. With its large speci ﬁc heat capacity (4.184 J/ g ·˚C) and
its broad temperature range (0 ˚C to 100 ˚C), liquid water can
absorb and release a lot of energy.
Water, a thermometer, and an isolated system are the
basic components of a calorimeter. A calorimeter is a device
that is used to measure changes in thermal energy. (Figures14.14 and 14.15 show two types of calorimeters.) The techno-logical process of measuring changes in thermal energy iscalled calorimetry .
How Calorimeters Work
In a polystyrene calorimeter, a known mass of water is inside the poly-
styrene cup. The water surrounds, and is in direct contact with, theprocess that produces the energy change. The initial temperature of thewater is measured. Then the process takes place and the ﬁnal temperature
of the water is measured. The water is stirred to maintain even energy distribution, and the system is kept at a constant pressure. This type ofcalorimeter can measure heat changes during processes such as dissolv-ing, neutralization, heating, and cooling.
A bomb calorimeter is used for the measurement of heat
changes during combustion reactions at a constant volume. It works on the same general principle as the polystyrenecalorimeter. The reaction, however, takes place inside an innermetal chamber, called a “bomb. ” This “bomb ” contains pure
oxygen. The reactants are ignited using an electric coil. Aknown quantity of water surrounds the bomb and absorbs theenergy that is released by the reaction. You will learn moreabout bomb calorimeters later in this section.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can
be changed into different forms, but it cannot be created ordestroyed. This law allows you to calculate the energy changein a calorimetry experiment. However, you need to make thefollowing assumptions:•The system is isolated. (No heat is exchanged with the
surroundings outside the calorimeter.)
•The amount of heat energy that is exchanged with the

When a process causes an energy change in a calorimeter, the change
in temperature is measured by a thermometer in the water. If you knowthe mass of the water and its speci ﬁc heat capacity, you can calculate the
change in thermal energy caused by the process. See Figures 14.16 and14.17 for examples.

A calorimeter measures the thermal energy that
is absorbed or released by a material. Today wemeasure heat using joules (J) or calories (cal).Early scientists accepted one unit of heat as theamount of heat required to melt 1 kg of ice. Thustwo units of heat could melt 2 kg of ice.
The earliest measurements of heat energy
were taken around 1760, by a Scottish chemistnamed Joseph Black. He hollowed out a chamberin a block of ice. Then he wiped the chamber dryand placed a piece of platinum, heated to 38 ˚C,
inside. He used another slab of ice as a lid. As theplatinum cooled, it gave up its heat to the ice. Theice melted, and water collected in the chamber.When the platinum reached the temperature ofthe ice, Black removed the water and weighed itto ﬁnd out how much ice had melted. In this way,
he measured the quantity of heat that wasreleased by the platinum.
In 1780, two French scientists, Antoine
Lavoisier and Pierre Laplace, developed the ﬁrst
apparatus formally called a calorimeter. LikeBlack, they used the amount of melted ice tomeasure the heat released by a material. Theircalorimeter consisted of three concentric cham-
bers. The object to be tested was placed in theinnermost chamber. Broken chunks of ice wereplaced in the middle chamber. Ice was alsoplaced in the outer chamber to prevent any heatreaching the apparatus from outside. As theobject in the inner chamber released heat, the icein the middle chamber melted. Water was drawnfrom the middle chamber by a tube, and thenmeasured.
Lavoisier made many important contributions
to the science of chemistry. Unfortunately hisinterest in political reform led to his arrest duringthe French Revolution. He was beheaded after atrial that lasted less than a day.
The original calorimeter used by Lavoisier and Laplace

A 70.0 g sample of a metal was heated to 95.0 ˚C in a hot water bath.

606 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyHeat of Combustion
How much energy is needed for a natural gas water heater, like the one
shown in Figure 14.18, to heat the hot water in your home? It is probablymuch more than you think! In the next Sample Problem, you will ﬁnd
out. You will also calculate the heat of combustion of a hydrocarbon: the
heat that is released when combustion occurs.
Problem
Many homes in North America use natural gas for general heatingand for water heating. Like calorimeters, natural gas water heatershave an insulated container that is ﬁlled with water. A gas ﬂame at
the bottom heats the water. A typical water heater might hold 151 Lof water.
(a)How much thermal energy is needed to raise the temperature of151 L of water from 20.5 ˚C to 65.0 ˚C? Note: Make the same three
assumptions that you made for calorimeters.
(b)If it takes 506 g of methane to heat this water, what is the heat ofcombustion of methane per gram?
What Is Required?
(a)You need to calculate the quantity of thermal energy ( Q) needed
to heat 151 L of water.
(b)You need to calculate the heat released per gram of methaneburned.
What Is Given?
(a)You know the initial and ﬁnal temperatures of the water. You also
know the volume of the water.Initial temperature (T
i)=20.5˚C
Final temperature (Tf)=65.0˚C
Volume =151 L
As well, you know the speci ﬁc heat capacity of water ( c):
4.184 J/g ·˚C or 4.184 kJ/kg ·˚C.
(b)You know the mass of the methane. Mass of  methane (m)=506 g
Plan Your Strategy
(a)This problem involves thermal energy and a change in tempera-
ture. You can use the heat equation Q=mc∆T. First calculate the
mass of 151 L of water. (Remember that the density of water atroom temperature is 1 g/mL, or 1 kg/L.) If you express the mass ofthe water in kilograms, you must also use the appropriate speci ﬁc
heat capacity of water: 4.184 kJ/kg ·˚C.
Note : To keep the calculation simple, assume that the density of
the water remains the same when it is heated. (This is not strictlytrue.)Sample Problem

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 607(b)Use the concept of heat lost =heat gained. Since a loss of heat
gives a negative value, use the following equation.
Qm=−Qw
To ﬁnd the heat per gram, divide the amount of heat by the mass
of methane.
Act on Your Strategy
(a)Mass of water =Volume ×Density
=(151 L)(1 kg/L)
=151 kg
Substitute into Q=mc∆T, and solve.
Q=mc∆T

=28 114 (kg)(kJ/kg ·˚C)(˚C)
=2.81×104kJ
Therefore, 2.81×104kJ, or 28.1 MJ (megajoules), of energy is needed
to heat the water. (This is a great deal of energy!)
(b)Qm=−Qw

heat per gram.
Qm(per gram) =Qm

=−2.81×104kJ
506 g
=−55.5 kJ/g
This means that 55.5 kJ of thermal (heat) energy is released
for each gram of methane that burns.
Check Your Solution
(a)The water gains heat, so the heat value is positive. Heat is expressed in kilojoules. (Joules are also acceptable.)
(b)The methane loses energy, so the heat value is negative. Since this value is the heat per gram, the unit is kJ/g.

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 609A Closer Look at Bomb Calorimetry
Polystyrene calorimeters are reasonably ef ﬁcient for measuring heat
changes during physical processes, such as dissolving and phase changes.They can also be used to measure heat changes during chemical process-es, such as neutralization. A stronger and more precise type of calorimeteris needed, however, to measure the heat of combustion of foods, fuels, andother materials. As you learned earlier, bomb calorimeters are used forthis purpose. (See Figure 14.19.)
Bomb calorimeters give more accurate measurements than
polystyrene calorimeters.
A bomb calorimeter has many more parts than a polystyrene calorimeter.
All of these parts can absorb or release small quantities of energy.Therefore, you cannot assume that the heat lost to the calorimeter is smallenough to be negligible. To obtain precise heat measurements, you mustknow or ﬁnd out the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter. Heat capacity
is the ratio of the heat gained or lost by a system to the change in tempera-ture caused by this heat. It is usually expressed in kJ/ ˚C. Unlike speci ﬁc
heat capacity, which refers to a single substance, heat capacity refers to asystem. Thus, the heat capacity of a calorimeter takes into account theheat that allparts of the calorimeter can lose or gain. (See Figure 14.20.)

610 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyA bomb calorimeter is calibrated for a constant mass of water. Since the
mass of the other parts remain constant, there is no need for mass units inthe heat capacity value. The manufacturer usually includes the heatcapacity value(s) in the instructions for the calorimeter.
Heat calculations must be done differently when the heat capacity of a
calorimeter is included. The next Sample Problem illustrates this.

612 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyFood as a Fuel
Food is the fuel for your body. It provides you with the energy you need
to function every day. Unlike the peanut butter in the previous problem,the food you digest is not burned. The process of digestion, however, isvery similar to burning. In fact, people often talk about “burning off
Calories. ” When food is digested, it undergoes slow combustion (without
ﬂames!) as it reacts with the oxygen you breathe. Eventually this combus-
tion produces the materials that your body needs. It also releases carbondioxide and water vapour as waste.
You have probably noticed that Calories are used more often than
kilojoules when discussing the energy in food (Figure 14.21). How arethese terms related?
For years, chemists used the calorie as a unit of energy. One calorie is
equal to 4.184 J. This is the amount of energy that is required to heat 1 gof liquid water by 1 ˚C. The food Calorie (notice the upper-case C) is equal
to one thousand calories, or one kilocalorie. Therefore one food Calorie is
equal to 4.184 kJ .
You will recall that in the last sample problem, 16.0 g of peanut butter
released 418 kJ of energy. To translate a value in kilojoules into Calories,multiply it by the fraction
1 Cal
4.184 kJ. For the Sample Problem,
418 kJ×1 Cal
4.184 kJ=100 Cal
Therefore, 16.0 g of peanut butter released 100 Cal of energy. Table 14.3
gives energy values in Calories for some foods.

8.28Energy Content in Fat and Carbohydrates Thought Lab
When you take in food energy, your body stores
excess food energy in the form of fat. If your bodyneeds energy later, it will use up some of this fat. Thisis the secret behind hibernation. Why is excess energyin your body stored as fat? Why is it not stored as protein or carbohydrates? The next ThoughtLab willexamine these questions. You will do calculations toﬁnd out which substance releases the most heat when
burned.
Many mammals in the animal kingdom rely on fat
that is stored in their bodies. By surviving on fat reserves that arestored during the autumn, bears can hibernate throughout thewinter without eating.Figure 14.22
614 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyComparing Fats and Hydrocarbons
One of the substances that you considered in the last ThoughtLab was
oleic acid. Oleic acid has a long hydrocarbon chain in each molecule.This hydrocarbon chain is similar to the hydrocarbon chains of fossilfuels, such as octane. (See Figure 14.23.)
By comparing octane and oleic acid, you can see that the heat of
combustion of fossil fuels must be similar to the heat of combustion of fats.
What is the relationship between the chemical bonds in a compound and
the amount of energy that the compound can store? You already knowthat the net energy of a reaction equals the difference between the energy
absorbed when the reactant bonds are broken and the energy released
when the product bonds are formed . The size of the difference re ﬂects
the strength of the bonds in the reactant molecules compared with thestrength of the bonds in the product molecules.
Figure 14.24 shows an exothermic reaction: the combustion of
methane. The stored energy of the products is less than the stored energyof the reactants. Therefore, a net amount of energy is released by the reaction. In an endothermic reaction, the stored energy of the products is greater than the stored energy of the reactants.

1.50Heat Combustion of Propane and Butane Thought Lab
Most of the energy change in a reaction is due to a change in the
potential energy (stored energy) of the bonds. All hydrocarbon fuels are
made of the same elements: carbon and hydrogen. They react to give thesame combustion products. As a result, the difference in the quantity ofheat energy that is released by any two hydrocarbons is directly related tothe stored energy in the bonds of these compounds. The next ThoughtLabcompares the heat energy that is released by the combustion of two fuels:propane and butane.
The Combustion of Candles

are long chain hydrocarbons. They are semisolid or solid at room temperature. One type of paraf ﬁn has been a household item for cen-

618 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyIn this section, you considered the importance of fossil fuels in our socie-
ty, based on the energy that we can obtain from fuel combustion. Youhave seen how thermal energy can be measured. You now know howmuch energy can be extracted from molecules that stored solar energymillions of years ago. Can our society continue to depend on this energysource without harming the environment? What risks result from our useof fossil fuels? You will explore these questions in the next section.
What is the difference between speciﬁc heat capacity and
heat capacity ?
List two characteristics of a calorimeter that are necessary for
successful heat measurement.
A calorimeter is calibrated at 7.61 kJ/ ˚C. When a sample of coal is
burned in the calorimeter, the temperature increases by 5.23 ˚C. How
much heat was lost by the coal?
A reaction in a calorimeter causes 150 g of water to decrease in
temperature by 5.0 ˚C. What is the thermal energy change of the water?
A company claims that its new Calorie-reduced dessert has less
than 10 Cal per serving. To test this claim, a technician at the depart-ment of Consumer and Corporate Affairs completely burns a serving ofthe dessert in a bomb calorimeter. The temperature change is 4.86 ˚C.
The heat capacity of the calorimeter is 8.28 kJ/ ˚C. Is the company ’s
claim correct?
(a) In Chapter 13, you compared the boiling points, a physical
property, of some hydrocarbons. In this section, you compared theheats of combustion, a chemical property, of propane, butane, andparaf ﬁn. Use a reference book, such as The CRC Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics . Look up the following hydrocarbons:
methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and hexane. Comparetheir densities, melting points, boiling points, and heats of combus-tion. Record your ﬁndings in charts and/or graphs. What patterns
do you observe? Which properties are physical, and which arechemical? Explain.
(b) Use your ﬁndings to estimate the heat of combustion of heptane.
At a comfortable indoor temperature of 22 ˚C, your body is at a
higher temperature than its surroundings. Therefore, it is constantlyradiating heat to the environment. It needs, however, to maintain aninternal temperature of 37 ˚C. How does it replace the heat that it is
constantly losing to the environment?
A heat pack can be used to supply heat to injuries. One type of
heat pack is re-usable. It contains a supersaturated solution of a saltand a disc of metal. When the metal disc is bent, the solute begins tocrystallize and releases heat. The pack can be reset by heating it inboiling water, which causes the salt to dissolve again. How can youaccount for the heat that is released by this kind of pack?K/U 8MC7CC 6I 5I 4I 3I 2K/U 1Section ReviewGo to a library, or access

How does the composition of these candles affect thecombustion of the paraf ﬁn?
Products made from petrochemicals (which are obtained from petroleum
and natural gas) have profoundly in ﬂuenced your life. Because of petro-
chemicals, you can use numerous products that did not exist 50 years ago (See Figures 14.26, 14.27, and 14.28). For example, one of the mostcommon materials around you —plastic —is made from petrochemicals.
The large numbers of petrochemicals that are used in manufacturing,however, are insigni ﬁcant when compared with the vast quantities of
hydrocarbons that are consumed each year as fossil fuels. As you learnedin Chapter 13, almost 95% of all petroleum that is extracted from theground is used as fuels and lubricants for vehicles.
Is there a cost for all that we obtain from hydrocarbons? Do these
amazing products carry any drawbacks? In this section, you will examinesome pros and cons of our society ’s reliance on hydrocarbons. You will

620 MHR • Unit 5  Hydrocarbons and EnergyRisks and Bene ﬁts
A risk is a chance of possible negative or dangerous results. Riding a
bicycle carries the risk of falling off. Driving a car carries the risk of anaccident. Almost everything you do has some kind of risk attached.Fortunately most risks are relatively small, and they may never happen.Many of the activities that carry risks also carry bene ﬁts. A beneﬁt is an
advantage, or positive result. For example, riding a bicycle provides thebene ﬁts of exercise, transportation, and enjoyment. When deciding to do
an activity, it may be a good idea to compare the risks and bene ﬁts
involved. (See Figure 14.29.)
Risk-Beneﬁt Analysis
Knowing more about an issue helps you assess its risks and bene ﬁts
more accurately. How can you make the most informed decision possible?Follow these steps to do your own assessment of risks and bene ﬁts, called
a risk-beneﬁt analysis .
Step 1 Identify possible risks and bene ﬁts of the activity. Decide how to
research these risks and bene ﬁts.
Step 2 Research the risks and bene ﬁts. You need information from reliable
sources to make an accurate analysis.
Step 3 Weigh the effects of the risks and bene ﬁts. You may ﬁnd that the
risks are too great and decide not to do the activity. On the otherhand, you may ﬁnd that the bene ﬁts are greater than the risks.
Step 4 Compare your method for doing the activity with other possible
methods. Do you use the safest method to do the activity? Onemethod may be much safer than another.
In the next Sample Problem, you will see how a risk-bene ﬁt analysis can
help you make informed decisions.Hydrocarbons, such as fossil
fuels, carry both risks and bene ﬁts. In a group, brainstorm
to identify some risks and bene ﬁts.
Would you like to

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 623Hydrocarbon fuels have changed the way we live. Our dependence on
them, however, has affected the world around us. The greenhouse effect,global warming, acid rain, and pollution are familiar topics on the newstoday. Our use of petroleum products, such as oil and gasoline, is linkeddirectly to these problems.
The Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming
Roads, expressways, service stations, and parking lots occupy almost 40%
of Toronto. They are the result of our demand for fast and ef ﬁcient trans-
portation. Every day, Toronto ’s vehicles produce nearly 16 000 t of carbon
dioxide by the combustion of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is an importantgreenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth ’s atmosphere and
prevent the heat from escaping into outer space. Scientists think that abuild-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may lead to an increase inglobal temperature, known as global warming . The diagram below shows
how these concepts are connected to fossil fuels.
Acid Rain
The combustion of fossil fuels releases sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These
oxides react with water vapour in the atmosphere to produce acid rain.Some lakes in northern Canada are “dead ” because acid rain has killed
the plants, algae, and ﬁsh that used to live in them. Forests in Qu ébec
and other parts of Canada have also suffered from acid rain.
Oil Spill Pollution
Our society demands a regular supply of fossil fuels. Petroleum is trans-
ported from oil-rich countries to the rest of the world. If an oil tanker carrying petroleum has an accident, the resulting oil spill can be disastrous to the environment.www.school.mcgrawhill.ca/

Everyday Oil Pollution
The biggest source of oil pollution comes from the everyday use of oil by
ordinary people. Oil that is dumped into water in urban areas adds to oilpollution from ships and tankers. In total, three million tonnes of oil reach
the ocean each year. This is equivalent to having an oil spill disaster every day!
A student from Thornhill, Ontario, did a home experiment to discover
how much oil remains in “empty ” motor oil containers that are thrown
out. He collected 100 empty oil containers from a local gas station. Thenhe measured the amount of oil that was left in each container. He foundan average of 36 mL per container. Over 130 million oil containers aresold and thrown out in Canada each year. Using these ﬁgures, he

Oil Spill Advisor
Developed nations, such as Canada, depend
heavily on petroleum. Our dependence affects the environment in many ways. Oil spills are adramatic example of environmental harm causedby petrochemicals. In the news, you may haveseen oceans on ﬁre and wildlife choked with tar.
What can we do?
Obviously the best thing to do is to prevent oil
spills from taking place. Stricter regulations andperiodic inspections of oil storage companieshelp to prevent oil leakage. Once an oil spill hasoccurred, however, biological , mechanical , and
chemical technologies can help to minimize
harm to the environment.
Biological methods involve helpful micro-
organisms that break down, or biodegrade ,
the excess oil. Mechanical methods depend onmachines that physically separate spilled oil from the environment. For example, barriers and booms are used to contain an oil spill andprevent it from spreading. Materials such as sawdust are sprinkled on a spill to soak up the oil. Two main chemical strategies are also used
to clean up oil spills. In the ﬁrst strategy, gelling
agents are added to react with the oil. The reac-
tion results in a bulky product that is easier to collect using mechanical methods. In the secondstrategy, dispersing agents break up oil into small
droplets that mix with the water. This preventsthe oil from reaching nearby shorelines.Dispersing agents work in much the same way as a bar of soap!
The scienti ﬁc advisor for an oil spill response
unit assesses a spill and determines the appropri-ate clean-up methods. She or he acts as part of a team of advisors. Most advisors have an M.Sc.or Ph.D. in an area of expertise such as organicchemistry, physical chemistry, environmentalchemistry, biology, oceanography, computermodelling, or chemical engineering.
Oil spill response is handled by private and
public organizations. All these organizations lookfor people with a background in chemistry. Infact, much of what you are learning about hydrocarbons can be related to oil spill response.Hydrocarbon chemistry can lead you directly to an important career, helping to protect theenvironment.

Chapter 14  Energy Trapped in Hydrocarbons • MHR 625calculated that nearly ﬁve million litres of oil are dumped into land ﬁll
sites every year, just in “empty ” oil containers!
Once oil reaches the environment, it is almost impossible to clean up.
Oil leaking from a land ﬁll site can contaminate drinking water in the area.
Because oil can dissolve similar substances, pollutants such as chlorineand pesticides, and other organic toxins, mix with the oil. They are carried with it into the water system, increasing the problem.
Solutions to Environmental Problems
All of the problems described above hinge on our use of fossil fuels. Thus,cutting back on our use of fossil fuels will help to reduce environmentaldamage. Cutting back on fossil fuels, however, depends on the consumerswho buy petrochemicals and use fossil fuels. In other words, it dependson you and the people you know.
Corporations that are looking for pro ﬁt have little incentive to change
their use of fossil fuels. For example, the technology is available to buildcars that can drive about 32 km on a single litre of fuel. Because this tech-nology is not ﬁnancially pro ﬁtable, cars are still being produced that drive
about 8 km per litre of fuel. If consumers demand and purchase morefuel-ef ﬁcient cars, however, car manufacturers will have an incentive to
produce such cars. Tougher government standards may also help to pushthe vehicle industry towards greater fuel ef ﬁciency.
Governments can also bring about change by endorsing the principle
of sustainable development. This principle was introduced at the 1992Earth Summit Conference. Sustainable development takes into account
the environment , the economy , and the health and needs of society .
(See Figure 14.31.)
Hydrocarbon fuels and products can bene ﬁt our society if they are
managed well. They can cause great environmental damage, however, if they are managed irresponsibly. With enough knowledge, you can learn to make informed decisions on these important issues. Here aresome suggestions of ways you can reduce your consumption of petroleumproducts. Why not choose one or more methods to practice? Or, brain-storm with your classmates to think of other ways to reduce consumption.•Contact your local government and local power companies. Suggest
using alternative fuels, such as solar energy and wind power.
•Ride a bicycle or walk more.
•Express your concerns by writing letters to the government or
to newspapers.
•Become more informed by researching issues that concern you.
•Fix oil leaks in vehicles, and avoid dumping oil down the sink.
•If you are cold at home, put on an extra sweater instead of
turning up the heat.

shopping bags.

It is the year 3000, and space travel is common-
place. Nearly one trillion human beings inhabitthe Milky Way galaxy now. They reside on thou-sands of planets that have been made habitable.You are part of a scientiﬁc team that has been sent to a newly discovered planet. Your team mustanalyse the resources present on the planet. Youwill also decide on the technological processesneeded to make the planet a safe place to live.This will involve removing dangerous toxins fromthe environment, and identifying possible sourcesof fuel, oxygen, water, and food.
The newly discovered planet has an insulating
atmosphere and temperature range similar toEarth’s. Each day on the planet is 25 Earth hourslong. Every day contains 8 hours of bright sun-light. However, the planet has no ocean, no
surface water, and no atmospheric water at all.There is evidence that plant life once existed on this planet. Without surface water, however,there are no plants living on the planet’s surface at the present time. A small population of bacteriamay be present.
One side of the planet contains a dry and
rocky desert, covered in part by a large crater. A thick layer of rock covers the other side of theplanet. Under this rocky surface runs a wide net-work of lava-tube tunnels. Scientists hypothesizethat a very large meteor may have struck the planet at one time. The meteor knocked off achunk of the planet. This chunk now orbits theplanet as a moon.

Planet Unknown • MHR 637Scientists believe that the enormous heat of
this collision decomposed all surface water intohydrogen and oxygen gases. This explains the lackof surface water on the planet. The heat also trig-gered massive volcanic eruptions. These eruptionsresulted in the rocky surface and lava tunnels thatcover half the planet.
Fortunately, organic dirt deposits still exist
underground, in pockets beneath the lava rock.These dirt deposits would be useful for growingfood. A sufﬁcient air supply, plant nutrients, andlight will also be necessary in order to grow food.  This challenge comprises ﬁve parts, each

ern, although extra plant nutrients will need to be added on a regularbasis as crops are grown and harvested. This cavern may be an excellentsite for growing vegetables and other plants. A source of light will beneeded.
Challenge
To grow suf ﬁcient crops, you will need large amounts of calcium
phosphate fertilizer. You can make this compound by combining thephosphate solution in the stream with calcium cations. Simulate this reac-tion in the laboratory. Design a procedure to ﬁnd the mass of dry calcium
phosphate precipitate. Mix 50 mL of a 0.10 mol/L aqueous solution ofsodium phosphate with suf ﬁcient calcium nitrate to obtain a precipitate.
Filter the precipitate, dry it, and determine its mass.
Write the balanced chemical equation and net ionic equation for
the reaction described in the Challenge.
Write up a procedure for your investigation, and have your teacher
approve it before you begin. Before starting, discuss appropriate safetyprecautions with your teacher. Wear eye protection. Wash your handsafter any contact with chemicals.
Prepare a detailed report to share your ﬁndings. Include all of your
observations and answers to the questions in Part 2.
In your report, compare the theoretical yield with the actual yield
of the product. Identify possible sources of error in your procedure.
If time permits, modify your procedure to improve your results.
Keep a detailed record of the changes you made to the procedure, theobserved bene ﬁts, and the new percent yields obtained.
Think and Research
Using the reactant amounts from your experiment, what mass of
sodium nitrate would you expect to get from the reaction? How couldyou collect this product to test your calculations?
Show the calculations you used to ﬁnd the amount of calcium
nitrate necessary to react with the phosphate solution.
If 600 L of 0.10 mol/L solution of sodium phosphate were reacted
with 10 kg of calcium nitrate, what would the limiting reagent be?
Extension
What other modi ﬁcations will you need to make the cavern
suitable for growing plants? For example, would you need to add othernutrients as fertilizer? Do sources of these nutrients exist on the planetalready? Write the chemical equations for the reactions.

640 MHR • Course ChallengePart 3: What’s in the Water?
Life as we know it is impossible without water. Thus it is essential to
establish a good water source. Although there is no surface water of any kind, the planet does have water —underground! Since this water
is constantly ﬁltered through underground rocks and soil, it contains
many dissolved substances. Some of these substances may be dangerousto human health. These materials will have to be removed in order toobtain clean water. How can you ﬁnd out what substances are present
in the water?
Challenge
Your teacher will give you a sample of water representing the planet ’s
underground water. Analyse the chemical composition of the water sam-ple. (Note that the sample you have may not be the same as the samples ofyour classmates.)
There are several methods you can use to analyse speci ﬁc components
of your sample. These may involve: •titration
•precipitation
•acid-base tests
•evaporation
•distillation
Choose one or more methods to analyse your sample. Your teacher
will give you further guidance on the methods that are most useful foryour speci ﬁc sample.
Write up a procedure for your investigation, and have your teacher
approve it before you begin. Before starting, discuss appropriate safetyprecautions with your teacher. Wear eye protection, gloves, and anapron.
After you have analysed your sample, prepare a detailed report.
Think and Research
What else might you need to know about your water sample?
How could you ﬁnd out?
Write a brief report that lists the different methods used to clean
water on Earth. Explain how each method works. Remember to includediagrams and any relevant balanced chemical equations.
Extension
A large river of clean, fresh water ﬂows through the largest lava
tunnel. At point B, a small river ﬂows into the larger river. This
smaller river contains dangerous levels of toxic nitrite ions ( NO
2−).
To prevent the smaller river from contaminating the larger one, youhave decided to limit the ﬂow of the small river. Safety standards per-
mit a maximum of 3.2 mg of nitrite per litre of water. The ﬂow of the
larger river is 1.2×10
4L/s. The concentration of nitrite in the smaller
river is 51.2 ppm. What amount of water (in L/s) can be allowed toenter the larger river from the smaller river?I 3C 2I 1C 3I 2I 1This part will call upon what you
learned in Unit 3, Solutions andSolubility. In particular, you willreview solutions, titrations, andacid-base chemistry.Preview
At point A, the river is clean.
At point C, however, the river is contaminated with the toxicnitrite ion. How can you containthe pollution at point B?
Planet Unknown • MHR 641Part 4: Planetary Gases
The atmosphere of the planet is composed of the following gases:
argon (49.2%) carbon dioxide (1.3%)
oxygen (30.8%) ammonia (0.9%)nitrogen (14.6%) dinitrogen oxide (0.5%)hydrogen cyanide (2.3%) hydrogen sul ﬁde (0.4%)
Although the atmosphere contains oxygen, it also contains gases that are
toxic to humans. Eventually, you hope to build a settlement inside a hugesynthetic bubble with its own safe atmospheric mixture of gases. First,your team must ﬁnd an alternate source of oxygen gas. On Earth, plants
supply oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. This may be thebest method of providing a constant supply of breathable air for the settle-ment bubble on the new planet. But do plants give off pure oxygen, or amixture of gases? How much oxygen does a certain mass of plants give off?
Challenge
Design an investigation to collect the gas given off by a certain mass ofRotela water plants. Find the mass and volume of the gas. Use this data to
calculate the molar mass and molar volume of the gas. ( Note: This experi-
ment will take several days to do correctly. If possible, do multiple trials.)
Write the balanced equations for photosynthesis and for cellular
respiration.
Write up a procedure for your investigation, and have your teacher
approve it before you begin. Before starting, discuss appropriate safetyprecautions with your teacher. Wash your hands after handling theRotela plants.
Carry out your procedure. Use the volume and the mass of the gas,
along with the temperature of the water and pressure of the room, tocalculate the average molar mass and the molar volume of the gas.
Prepare a detailed report to share your ﬁndings. In your report,
compare the molar mass of the gas you calculated to the molar mass ofoxygen. Explain the difference between these values. Identify possiblesources of error in your procedure.
Think and Research
Your team sends a balloon 50 m up into the atmosphere of the
planet. The balloon contains 20.3 mol of helium gas. At a temperatureof 313 K, the balloon has a volume of 614 L. Assume that the universalgas constant, R, has the same value as it would on Earth. What is theatmospheric pressure on this planet at 313 K? What is it at 0 ˚C?
Use the pressure at 0 ˚C from the previous question. What is the
partial pressure of each of the components of the atmosphere?
What volume will 1.44 kg of oxygen gas occupy at the planet ’s
atmospheric pressure? (Assume a temperature of 0 ˚C.)
Rearrange the ideal gas equation to calculate the molar volume for
any ideal gas on this planet at 0 ˚C.

During cellular respiration,
plant cells use oxygen to breakdown food into energy. Thus,plants take in oxygen and giveoff carbon dioxide. When in thepresence of light, plants alsotake in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen during photo-synthesis. Does cellular respi-ration use up the same amountof oxygen that is given off byphotosynthesis? Do plants giveoff a net amount of oxygen,carbon dioxide, or a combina-tion of the two? Do research to ﬁnd out.
(a)Photosynthesis only
occurs during the hoursof sunlight. At night, onlyrespiration is takingplace. How might thisaffect your investigation?
(b)Remember to include thevapour pressure of waterin your calculations.
(c)Did the temperature orpressure change over thecourse of the experi-ment? Design your inves-tigation to include somechecks on this data.PROBLEM TIP
642 MHR • Course ChallengePart 5: Finding Fuel
While exploring the lava tunnels, your team discovers a coal-like
substance. This substance may have originated as a fungus growing inunderground caves. When the meteor hit the planet, the caves collapsed.Over millions of years, the pressure of the rock converted the organicmaterial into a fossil fuel.
Challenge
Your teacher will give you a sample of the coal-like substance discoveredon the planet. Design a calorimeter to measure the heat of combustion ofthis substance. Decide whether this substance will be useful as a fuel.
Write up a procedure for your investigation, and have your teacher
approve it before you begin. Before starting, discuss appropriate safetyprecautions with your teacher. Wear eye protection, and use care withhot surfaces.
Carry out your procedure. Calculate the heat of combustion per
gram of your sample.
Prepare a detailed report to share your ﬁndings.
Think and Research
Your team has also discovered large pools of hydrocarbon oils on the
surface of the planet. The hydrocarbons seem similar to hydrocarbons onEarth, and may have been formed in the same way. When analysed, theoil proves to be composed entirely of compounds with the molecular formula C
7H16.
How might these hydrocarbon oils have originated?
Draw and name all the possible isomers that have this
molecular formula.
What might be done with the open pools of oil? Give two
or three possibilities.
On another area of the planet, your team discovers a vent with
gas seeping from it. The gas is found to be 81.7% carbon and 18.3%hydrogen by mass. The molecular mass of the gas is 44.11 g/mol. What is the formula of the compound? Name the gas. Draw the struc-tural formula of the compound.
Suppose you decide to use the coal-like substance and the
pools of oil as fuel. How might your use of these fuels affect the environment on the planet? What precautions will you take to preventenvironmental damage?

Planet Unknown • MHR 643Part 6: Final Presentation
What other challenges might humans face while developing this planet?
You may want to investigate a different problem. For example:
Unit 1
•Suppose matter on the new planet were not composed of electrons,
protons, and neutrons. Devise a new atomic theory of your own. Explainhow it works in “real life ” on the planet. Make up a small, functional
periodic table with new, imaginary elements.
•Develop rules that explain the bonding between your new atoms.
How do these rules affect the reactivity of your elements and structureof your compounds?
Unit 2
•Suggest reactions that may make life easier on the planet. Research and
perform these reactions in the laboratory. Write balanced equations, andcalculate percent yields in moles and in grams. Explain the purpose ofthese reactions in the settlers lives.
Unit 3
•Suggest one or more substances that may already be dissolved in the
water on the newly-discovered planet. Test the solubility of the sub-stance and plot solubility curves for the solute in water. Explain whythe substance is in the water, and how the substance will affect the lifeof the settlers. For example, is it safe to drink? How can it be removedfrom the water? Once extracted, can it be used for anything else?
Unit 4
•Choose a reaction producing a gas that may be useful to settlers on the
new planet. Research the reaction, then carry it out in the laboratory.Collect the gas produced and determine its molar volume.
Unit 5
•Choose three of these compounds: NaOH, anhydrous CaCl 2, LiBr, HCl,
anhydrous Na2SO4, AgNO 3, KI, NH 4NO 3, Na2CO3·10H 2O, and KMnO 4.
Design an investigation to measure and compare the heats of solutionper mole of these chemicals. Choose one chemical based on its heat ofsolution, and its safety for everyday use. Come up with a plan or devicethat uses the heating or cooling effect produced by this process to helpthe planet ’s settlers remain comfortable.
Your presentation After preparing lab reports on one or more sections
of this Course Challenge, you will share your results in a class presenta-tion. Assume this presentation is being made to the Canadian Minister of Emigration, the Canadian Minister of the Economy, and a group of business people who may wish to invest in the development of the planet.
•Provide your audience with solutions to the different scenarios and
problems you investigated. Be prepared to respond to other possiblequestions and problems your audience (your class and teacher) may raise.
•To enhance your presentation, try to include two or more of the
following: posters, brochures, drama, music, lab demonstrations, videoor audio clips, charts or graphs, surveys, models, multimedia, or webpages with links.

Expanding the
Model of the Atom
In science, theoretical models and experimental evi-
dence are always linked. For example, early scientistsbelieved that rotting meat generated maggots. Thisseemed reasonable, since exposed meat becomes infest-ed with maggots. Experiments proved, however, that ifthe meat was protected from ﬂies, no maggots appeared.
Thus, rotting meat didn ’t generate maggots; ﬂies did.
When a  model fails to explain experimental evidence,scientists must discard or modify that model. Themodel of the atom is no exception.
Emission Spectra
In Chapter 2, you used a diffraction grating to observethe spectra of various elements. These elements weresealed in gas discharge tubes. The spectra resulted fromelectrons in atoms moving from higher energy levels tolower energy levels and releasing energy as light.
Each wavelength of visible light is associated
with a colour. When white light is shone through a gasdischarge tube, it produces a line spectrum. A line spectrum is a series of narrow lines having speci ﬁc
colours (energy), separated by colourless spaces. Eachelement produces a different and characteristic emissionspectrum. You can see several examples of these spectrain Figure D.1. Scientists who were thinking about howto describe the atom needed to take the emission spectrainto account.
The top spectrum is the continuous spectrum
of white light. The others are emission spectra for hydrogen,mercury, and neon. Each element has its own distinct spectrum, which is like a “ﬁngerprint ” for that element.Bohr ’s Model of the Atom
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr developed a
model of the atom that explained the hydrogen emissionspectrum. In Bohr ’s model, electrons orbit the nucleus
in the same way that Earth orbits the Sun, as shown inFigure D.2. The following three points of Bohr ’s theory
help to explain hydrogen ’s emission spectrum.
1.In Bohr ’s model, atoms have speci ﬁc allowable
energy levels. He called these energy levels stationary states . Each of these levels corresponds
to a ﬁxed, circular orbit around the nucleus.
2.An atom does not give off energy when its electrons
are in a stationary state.
3.An atom changes stationary states by giving off or
absorbing a quantity of light energy exactly equal tothe difference in energy between the two stationarystates.
In Bohr ’s atomic model, electrons move around
the nucleus with ﬁxed, circular orbits.
Bohr ’s model was revolutionary, because he proposed
that the energy absorbed or emitted by an atom neededto have speci ﬁc values. The energy change was
quantized, rather than continuous. When something is quantized , it means that it is limited to discrete
amounts or multiples of discrete amounts. Two greatscientists paved the way for this surprising idea.German physicist Max Planck had already suggestedthat energy in general was quantized, meaning that itexists in “packets. ” Building on this idea, Einstein
proposed that light could behave as particles, which he called photons .
The energy associated with the light in a line
spectrum corresponds with the change in energy of anelectron as it moves up or down an energy level. Forexample, when electrons in hydrogen atoms that havebeen excited to the third energy level subsequently dropto the second energy level, they emit light that has aspeci ﬁc energy. They emit photons of red light that have
a wavelength of 656.3 nm. These photons cause the redline on the line spectrum for hydrogen, which you cansee in Figure D.1.
Why a New Model?
So what was the problem? Bohr ’s model worked
beautifully, correctly predicting the line spectrum forFigure D.2e–e–

Expanding the Model of the Atom • MHR 657hydrogen. It also worked ﬁne for ions with one electron,
such as He+, Li2+, Be3+, etc. The model failed, however,
when it was applied to the emission spectra of atomsthat had more than one electron. Bohr ’s model needed
to be modi ﬁed, because it was too simple to explain the
experimental evidence.
Sublevels
The spectra of many-electron atoms suggested that amore complex structure was needed. Notice in FigureD.1 that spectra for these more complex atoms havegroups of lines close together. The groups are separatedby spaces. The large spaces represent the energy differ-ences between energy levels, while the smaller spacesrepresent energy differences within the levels.
If the electrons are changing energy within the
levels, this suggests that there are sublevels within each
level, each with its own slightly different energy. Theidea of energy levels 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. remains, but eachenergy level is split up into sublevels called s, p, d,
and f. Examine Table D.1 to see how electrons are
arranged in sublevels for energy levels 1 to 4.
Table D.1 Distribution of
Electrons in Energy Levels and Sublevels
Each sublevel has its own energy. Examine Figure D.3 to
see the relative energies of the levels and sublevels.
This ﬁgure shows the relative energies of
sublevels in energy levels 1, 2, and 3.Visualizing the New Model
But where do you ﬁnd the electrons in this new model?
How are the sublevels oriented in space? Several theories enabled scientists to describe what the newlyconceived atom “looked like. ”
Particles with Wave-Like Properties
In 1924, Louis de Broglie, a young physics student,
suggested that all matter had wave-like properties. Thisseemed to follow from Planck and Einstein ’s idea that
electromagnetic radiation has matter-like properties. De Broglie developed an equation that allowed him tocalculate the wavelength of the matter wave associatedwith any object, from a bowling ball to an electron.Objects that we can see and can interact with have calculated wavelengths that are smaller than electrons.Their wavelengths are so tiny compared to their sizethat they do not have any measurable effect on themotion of the objects.
For very tiny moving particles, however, such as
electrons, the wavelength becomes very signi ﬁcant.
In fact, an electron moving at an average speed has awavelength even larger than the size of the entire hydrogen atom!
De Broglie ’s theory was proven by experiment
when streams of electrons produced diffraction patternssimilar to those produced by electromagnetic radiation,which was already known to travel in waves.
Orbitals
In 1926, Erwin Schr ödinger used de Broglie ’s idea that
matter has wavelike properties. Schr ödinger proposed
what is now known as the quantum mechanical model
of the atom . In this new model, he abandoned the
notion of the electron as a small particle orbiting thenucleus. Instead, he took into account the particle ’s
wavelike properties, and described the behaviour of electrons in terms of wave functions.
The imprecise nature of Schr ödinger ’s model was
supported shortly afterwards by a principle proposed byWerner Heisenberg, in 1927. Heisenberg demonstratedthat it is impossible to know both an electron ’s path-
way and its exact location. Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle is a mathematical relationship that shows that
you can never know both the position and the momen-tum of an object beyond a certain measure of precision.

The momentum of an object is its mass multiplied by its
velocity. An object ’s momentum is directly related to the
amount of energy it has.FACTCHEM
658 MHR • Appendix DHeisenberg also showed that if you could know either
velocity or position precisely, then the other propertywould be uncertain. Therefore, when talking aboutwhere electrons are found in an atom, you cannot talkin terms of certainties, but only in terms of probabilities.
Schr ödinger used a mathematical wave equation
to de ﬁne the probability of ﬁnding an electron within an
atom. There are multiple solutions to this wave equation and Schr ödinger called these solutions wave
functions, or orbitals . Each solution provides informa-
tion about the energy and location of an electron withinan atom. Each orbital has a speci ﬁc energy associated
with it, and each contains information about where,inside the atom, the electrons would spend most oftheir time. The actual paths of the moving electronscannot be determined. However, the solutions can beused to show where, for each orbital, there is a highprobability of ﬁnding an electron.
Imagine you were able to take many exact measure-
ments of the position of an electron in the 1 ssublevel
at ﬁxed intervals. At each second, you would mark the
electron ’s position on a graph. After a while, your graph
might look something like the ﬁrst diagram in Figure
D.4. If someone tried to use your graph to determinewhere the electron was, they would not be able to stateits position exactly. They would, however, be able to see that the probability of ﬁnding the electron would be
greater near the nucleus and would decrease fartheraway from the nucleus.
The probability graph is “fuzzy, ” because the proba-
bility of ﬁnding an electron anywhere in a 1 ssublevel
is never zero. The probability becomes extremely smallwhen it is far away from the nucleus, but it never quitereaches zero. Therefore, to obtain an exact shape for an orbital, you need to choose a level of probability. For example, drawing a contour that encompasses 95 percent of the probability graph results in a sphericalshape, like the third diagram in Figure D.4. In otherwords, at any time, there is a 95 percent chance of ﬁnding the electron within the spherical contour.
These three ﬁgures represent the probability
of ﬁnding an electron at any point in a hydrogen atom.
The two-dimensional drawing on the left shows that theelectron spends most of its time fairly close to the nucleus.The circle around the cloud in the centre encompasses 95 percent of the two-dimensional cloud. The diagram on the right shows the 95 percent probability contour in threedimensions.Shapes of Orbitals
The shapes of the probability graphs from Schr ödinger ’s
wave functions are the shapes of the orbitals in whichelectrons reside in atoms. You can visualize orbitals aselectron clouds. The shape of each cloud is based onprobability —it tells you where the electron spends
most of its time.
Examine Figure D.5. The sorbitals are spherical in
shape, as described above. Each of these spherical shellscontains two electrons. There are three porbitals for
each sublevel, each with a capacity for two electrons.Each orbital is shaped something like a dumbbell. Foreach sublevel, the porbitals are oriented along the x, y,
and zaxes. Therefore, the three porbitals in each sub-
level are sometimes designated with subscripts to showthis. For example, the 2 porbitals may be designated
2p
x, 2py, 2pz.
This ﬁgure shows the shapes of the 2 sand 2 p
orbitals.
The dand forbitals are quite complex in shape. Each d
sublevel contains ﬁve dorbitals, while each fsublevel
contains seven forbitals.
Filling the Orbitals
Why is it that each orbital can contain only two
electrons? A hypothesis suggests that electrons spinaround their own axes as they move around the nucle-us, generating magnetic ﬁelds. They can spin either in
a positive direction or in a negative direction. In 1925,Wolfgang Pauli proposed that only two electrons ofopposite spin could occupy an orbital. This idea becameknown as the Pauli exclusion principle .Figure D.5xz

Expanding the Model of the Atom • MHR 659How do electrons ﬁll orbitals within atoms? They do
so in such a way as to minimize the potential energy ofthe atom.
1.They will ﬁll orbitals with the lowest energy ﬁrst.
The 1 sorbital will ﬁll before the 2 sorbital, which
will ﬁll before the 2 porbitals.
2.When occupying two or more orbitals with the same
energy (for example, any of the three 2 porbitals),
electrons will half ﬁll each orbital until all are half
ﬁlled before adding a second electron to each one.
This is called Hund ’s rule .
You can show how electrons ﬁll orbitals, using
superscripts. For example, a boron atom contains ﬁve electrons. Here ’s how you show the electron
conﬁguration:
1s
2, 2s2, 2px1
How would you show the electron con ﬁguration of a
nitrogen atom? Remember Hund ’s rule:
1s2, 2s2, 2px1, 2py1, 2pz1
Using the Model
The quantum mechanical model of the atom is useful
for explaining phenomena in addition to emission spectra. For example, in Chapter 2, you learned abouttrends in ionization energy. You learned that, in general,ionization energy increases across a period. Figure D.6shows the ionization energy as a function of atomicnumber for the ﬁrst 18 elements. In most cases, the
ionization energy follows the trend. There are someexceptions, however, such as oxygen, boron, and sulfur.You can use the quantum model of the atom to explainthese discrepancies.

Math and Chemistry
In chemistry, quantities and values are often very, very
large or very, very small. One mole of H2Ocontains a
huge number (602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000) of molecules. The mass of each molecule is minuscule(0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9 g). To calculatethe mass of one mole of H
2Ousing the above data, you
multiply the number of molecules in a mole by the massof an individual molecule. Imagine doing this by hand:
602 214 199 000 000 000 000 000
×0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 029 9

18.0062045501 g
There is another problem with writing all these zeros:
It implies that they are all signi ﬁcant digits. Yet the non-
ﬁnal zeros to the right of the decimal point in the mass
of an H2Omolecule are used as placeholders. They are
not signi ﬁcant digits. There are only three
signi ﬁcant digits in
0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 0 29 9 g
Scienti ﬁc Notation
To simplify reporting large numbers and doing calcula-
tions, you can use scienti ﬁc notation. As you learned in
an earlier mathematics course, scienti ﬁc notation works
by using powers of 10 as multipliers.
The number of particles in one mole of a substance
(the Avogadro constant ) is often rounded down to
602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000. When performingcalculations, however, this number is still too unwieldy.To simplify it, you can express it as a number between 1 and 10, multiplied by factors of 10. To do this, movethe decimal point behind the left-most non-zero digit,counting the number of places that the decimal pointmoves. The number of places moved is the exponent forthe base 10.
6.02×10
23
The decimal point moves to the left.
Numbers less than 1 are converted into scienti ﬁc
notation by moving the decimal point to the right of theleft-most non-zero digit. The exponent is expressed as anegative power of 10.
2.99×10
−23
The decimal point moves to the right.Once you have numbers in scienti ﬁc notation, calcula-
tions become much simpler. To ﬁnd the mass of one
mole of H2O, you can multiply ( 6.02×1023/mol) ×
(2.99×10−23g). To do this without a calculator, you
ﬁrst multiply.
6.02×2.99=17.9998 →18.0 (rounded up to three
signi ﬁcant digits)
When multiplying, exponents are added to ﬁnd the new
exponent: −23+23=0.
This gives 18.0×100g/mol. In scienti ﬁc notation,
however, there must be only one digit before the deci-mal place. Here the decimal place must be moved oneplace to the left: 1.80×10
1g/mol.
Figure E.3 shows how to do this calculation with a
scienti ﬁc calculator. When you enter an exponent on a
scienti ﬁc calculator, you do not have to enter ( ×10) at
any time.
On some scienti ﬁc calculators, the ¨key
is labelled ´. Key in negative exponents by entering the
exponent, then striking the —key.
Rules for Scientiﬁc Notation
•When multiplying, exponents are added algebraically.
(2.37×104g)×(1.89×10−1g)
=(2.37×1.89)×10(4+(−1))
=4.4793×103g→4.48×103g
•When dividing, exponents are subtracted
algebraically.
(9.23×106L)÷(4.11×104L)
=(9.23÷4.11)×10(6−4)
=2.245742 ×102L→2.25×102L
•When adding or subtracting numbers in scienti ﬁc
notation, the numbers must be converted to the samepower of 10 as the measurement with the greatestpower of 10. Once the numbers are all expressed tothe same power of 10, the power of 10 is neitheradded nor subtracted in the calculation.

Logarithms
Calculators have made multiplication and division as
easy as adding and subtracting. Before calculators wereinvented, however, what did people do? In 1614, JohnNapier (1550 –1617) invented logarithms to help people
multiply and divide large numbers.
Why do logarithms make multiplication and
division easier? Recall, from the power laws, how youmultiply and divide powers. To multiply powers withthe same base, you add the exponents. To divide powerswith the same base, you subtract the exponents.Logarithms are exponents. Therefore, to multiply large numbers using logarithms, you simply add the logarithms. To divide large numbers using logarithms,you subtract the logarithms.
Find the log (for “logarithm ”) key on your calcula-
tor. Enter 1000 or 10
3into your calculator, then press
the log key. The number 3 will be in the display. Nowenter 10 000 or any other power of 10. Press the log key. What is displayed for the log of the number? (The logarithm of any power of 10 is just the exponent.)
How do you multiply one million by one billion,
or 10
6×109, using logarithms? You add the exponents,
or logarithms, of these two numbers: 6+9=15. The
answer is 1015, a power of 10. This power is called the
antilogarithm of the logarithm 15.
Logarithms may not seem like a major discovery,
but John Napier also evaluated logarithms for numberssuch as 2, 3, 5, and 764. (Table E.1 has more examplesof logarithms.) Enter 2 into your calculator, and pressthe log key. The display will show 0.3010, to four signi ﬁcant digits. This means that 10
0.3010=2. Repeat
to ﬁnd the log of 3. The display will show 0.4771. This
means that 100.4771=3.
You know that 2×3=6. If you add 0.3010 to
0.4771, you get 0.7781. What is 100.7781? Enter 0.7781
into your calculator. Find the 10xkey. (Usually it is
above the log key, as a second function.) Press the 10xkey. If you round the answer in the display, you will
get 6.
Find the log of 8 and the log of 4. You know
that 8÷4=2. Subtract the log of 4 from the log of
8: 0.9031−0.6021=0.3010 . This answer is the log
of 2: 100.9031÷100.6021=100.3010=2. Evaluate 100.3010
on your calculator by typing in 0.3010 and using the
10xkey.
Table E.1 Some Numbers and Their Logarithms
Notice that numbers above 1 correspond to logarithms
whose value is positive; numbers below 1 correspond to logarithms whose value is negative. Over the years,scientists have found logarithms convenient for morethan calculations. Logarithms can be used to expressvalues that span a range of powers of 10, such as pH. In Chapter 10, section 10.2, concentrations of acids are discussed. The pH of an acid solution is de ﬁned
as –log[H
3O+]. (The square brackets mean “concentra-
tion. ”) For example, suppose that the hydronium
ion concentration in a solution is 0.0001 mol/L (10
−4mol/L). The pH is –log(0.0001). To calculate this,
enter 0.0001 into your calculator. Then press the logkey. Since the logarithm is negative, press the —key.
The answer in the display is 4. Therefore the pH of the solution is 4.
As stated above, there are logarithms for all
numbers, not just whole multiples of 10. What is the pHof a solution if [H
3O+]=0.00476 mol/L? Enter 0.00476.
Press the log key and then the —key. The answer is
2.322. Remember that the concentration was expressedto three signi ﬁcant digits. The pH to three signi ﬁcant
digits is 2.32.
What if you want to ﬁnd the [ H
3O+] from the pH?
You would need to ﬁnd 10−pH. For example, what is the
[H3O+] if the pH is 5.78? Enter 5.78, and press the —
key. Then use the 10xfunction. The answer is 10−5.78.
Therefore, the [ H3O+] is 1.66×10−6mol/L.
Remember that the pH scale is a negative log scale.
Thus, a decrease in pH from pH 7 to pH 4 is an increaseof 10
3, or 1000, in the acidity of a solution. An increase
from pH 3 to pH 6 is a decrease of 103, or 1000, in
acidity.1 000 000

Linear Graphs
Suppose that you conduct a Boyle ’s law experiment.
(See Chapter 11, section 11.2.) You obtain data that aresimilar to the data in Table E.2.
Table E.2 Boyle ’s Law Data
Looking at the data does not tell you much about the
relationship between the two variables: the volume ( V)
and the inverse pressure (1
P). What if you graph the
data? Put 1
P(the independent variable) on the x-axis.
Put V(the dependent variable) on the y-axis. The scale
for 1
Pshould go from 0 to at least 0.01. The scale for V
should go from 0 to at least 50.0. To plot each point, goalong the x-axis until you reach the value of 1
P(such as
0.01). Then go up from this point to the correspondingvalue of V(50.0). After you have plotted all the points,
draw the line of best ﬁt through the points. (See Figures
E.4A and E.4B).
Finding a Point on a Graph
Drawing a Line of Best Fit
Examine the graph in Figure E.4B. You can see that the
points form a straight line that goes through the origin,(0,0). You can also see that there is a linear relationshipbetween the volume and the inverse pressure.
Mathematically, this means that the volume is
directly proportional to the inverse pressure, or V
∝ 1
P.
To remove the proportionality sign and replace it withan equal sign, Vmust be multiplied by a proportionality
constant, k.
∴V=k(1
P)
V=k
P
PV=k
How can you determine the proportionality constant?
Recall, from mathematics courses, that the equation of a straight line that goes through the origin is given by
y=mx, where mis the slope of the line. Also recall the
equation for the slope of a straight line.

This equation is illustrated in Figure E.4C.Figure E.4B1020304050

What happens if the data do not give a line that goes
through the origin? The data in Table E.3 came from an experiment to determine the density of an unknownliquid. The student forgot to measure the mass of thecontainer that was used to hold the various volumes of the liquid.
Table E.3 Mass and Volume of a Liquid
Graph of Mass and Volume of a LiquidThese data are plotted, as shown in Figure E.5, with
the volume on the x-axis and the mass on the y-axis.
The equation of this line is in the form y=mx+b,
where mis the slope of the line and bis the y-intercept.
(The y-intercept is the value of ywhere the line crosses
the y-axis. This value occurs when x=0.) Thus, the
relationship here is m=kV+b, where the kis the slope
of the line. As before,
k=(y2−y1)
(x2−x1)
=(97.2−63.8) g
(80−30) mL
=0.668 g/mL
Therefore, the equation of the line is m=0.668 V+b.
If there is no liquid, both the mass and the volume ofthe liquid are zero. Notice, however, that there is still avalue for mass on the graph. This is the value of b, the
y-intercept, which is 43.8 g. It represents the mass of
the container. Therefore, the ﬁnal equation is
m=0.668 V+43.8.
Consider one more example. Two different sets of
data for Charles ’ law experiments are given in Table E.4.
Table E.4 Charles ’ Law Data
Set 1 Set 2
The linear graphs of both sets of data are given in
Figure E.6, on the same pair of axes. Since two differentsamples of gas were used, there are two different linesin the form y=mx+b. Notice that the lines intersect at
−273˚C, or 0 K, the theoretical lowest temperature possi-
ble. (The linear graphs for the temperature and volumeof all gases go through this point.) If the y-axis was
moved to this point and a new origin was establishedhere, then the equations for the lines would be in theform y=mx. This is what happens when you convert
temperatures to the Kelvin scale.

The Unit Analysis
Method of Problem Solving
The unit analysis method of problem solving is
extremely versatile. You can use it to convert betweenunits or to solve simple formula problems. If you forgeta formula during a test, you may still be able to solvethe problem using unit analysis.
The unit analysis method involves analyzing the
units and setting up conversion factors. You match andarrange the units so that they divide out to give thedesired unit in the answer. Then you multiply anddivide the numbers that correspond with the units. Steps for Solving Problems
Using Unit Analysis
Step 1 Determine which data you have and which con-
version factors you need to use. (A conversionfactor is usually a ratio of two numbers withunits, such as 1000 g/1 kg. You multiply the givendata by the conversion factor to get the desiredunits in the answer.) It is often convenient to use the following three categories to set up yoursolution: Have, Need, and Conversion Factors.
Step 2 Arrange the data and conversion factors so that
you can cross out the undesired units. Decidewhether you need any additional conversion fac-tors to get the desired units in the answer.
Step 3 Multiply all the numbers on the top of the ratio.
Then multiply all the numbers on the bottom ofthe ratio. Divide the top result by the bottomresult.
Step 4 Check that the units have cancelled correctly.
Also check that the answer seems reasonable,and that the signi ﬁcant digits are correct.
