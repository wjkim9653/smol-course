A notable Greek philosopher,namely, Democritus , believed that all matter was composed of very tiny, indivisible\nparticles. He called them atomos .

The three laws are:\ni)The law of conservation of mass  states that matter is neither created nor\ndestroyed. This law is also called the law of indestructibility of matter. It meansthat the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the mass of the products inany chemical reaction. A chemical reaction involves only the separation and unionof atoms.\nii)The law of definite proportions  states that a pure compound is always\ncomposed of the same elements combined in a definite ratio by mass. Forexample, water ( H\n2O) is composed of hydrogen and oxygen only. These elements\nare always in the proportion of 11.19% hydrogen to 88.81% oxygen by massand in the proportion 2 : 1 by volume.\niii) The law of multiple proportions  states that when two different compounds are\nformed from the same elements, the masses of one of the elements in the twocompounds, compared to a given mass of the other element, is in a small whole-number ratio. For example, carbon and oxygen form two compounds: carbonmonoxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide contains 1.3321 g of oxygenfor each 1 g of carbon, whereas carbon dioxide contains 2.6642 g of oxygenfor each 1g of carbon. Hence, carbon dioxide contains twice the mass of oxygenas does carbon monoxide.\nActivity 1.2\nActivity 1.2\nForm a group and perform the following task.

However, a series of\ninvestigations and astounding discoveries clearly demonstrated that atoms are made upof smaller particles, called subatomic particles. The three fundamental subatomic\nparticles  of an atom are electrons, protons, and neutrons.\n1.2.1  Discovery of the Electron\nDo you think that there is a similarity between cathode rays and electrons?\nThe electron was the first subatomic particle to be identified. In 1879, William\nCrooke  studied electrical discharges in partially evacuated tubes called\ndischarge tubes .\nTwo electrodes from a high-voltage source are sealed into a glass tube from which air\nhas been evacuated. The negative electrode is the cathode and the positive one is theanode. When the high-voltage current is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenishlight and a beam of light is seen at the anode. These rays flow from the cathodetowards the anode in a straight line. They are called cathode rays . Later on, in 1897,\nJ.J. Thomson  found that the beam was deflected by both electrical and magnetic\nActivity 1.4\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n7fields. In an electric field, they bend toward the positive plate.

Since these rays could not be deflected by a magnet, they could not containcharged particles as cathode rays do. Röntgen  called them X-rays.\nNot long after Röntgen’s  discovery, Antoine Becquerel , a professor of physics in\nParis, began to study fluorescent properties of substances. He found that exposingthickly wrapped photographic plates to a certain uranium compound caused them todarken, even without the stimulation of cathode rays. Like X-rays, the rays from theuranium compound were highly energetic and could not be deflected by a magnet.Also, these rays were generated spontaneously. One of Becquerel's students, Marie\nCurie , suggested the name radioactivity  to describe this spontaneous emission of\nparticles and/or radiation. Consequently, any element that spontaneously emitsradiation is said to be radioactive .\nFurther investigation revealed that three types of rays are produced by the “decay”, or\nbreakdown of radioactive substances such as uranium, polonium, and radium.

This indicated the presence\nof a heavy positive centre in the atom, which Rutherford named the nucleus.\n3.Only a few particles (1 in about a million) were either deflected by a very large\nangle or deflected back. This confirmed that the space occupied by the heavypositive centre must be very small.\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n11\nActivity 1.7\nForm a group and perform the following task. Present your findings to the class.\nPredict what Rutherford might have observed if he had bombarded copper metal instead\nof gold metal with alpha particles.\nFrom the angles through which alpha particles are deflected, Rutherford calculated\nthat the nucleus of an atom has a radius of about 10–15 m. The radius of the whole\natom is about 10–10 m. Therefore, the nucleus is about 1/10,000 (one ten-thousandth)\nof the size of the atom as a whole. Thus, if we magnified an atom to the size of afootball stadium (about 100 m across), the nucleus would be represented by a peaplaced at the centre of the pitch.\nRutherford  suggested that the negatively charged electrons surrounding the positively\ncharged nucleus are like planets around the sun revolving. He could not explain,\nhowever, what kept the electrons in motion around the nucleus.\n1.2.3  Discovery of Neutrons\nIn 1932, an English scientist, James Chadwick , identified the existence of neutrons.\nHe bombarded a thin foil of beryllium with α-particles of a radioactive substance.

Hydrogen, H, has atomic number 1,\nhence, atoms of the element hydrogen have one proton in the nucleus. Next is helium,He, which has two protons in its nucleus. Lithium, Li, has three protons. Beryllium,\nBe, has four protons, and so on.\nMass Number ( A) is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of\nan atom. Collectively, the protons and neutrons of an atom are called its nucleons .\nMass Number ( A) = Number of protons + Number of neutrons\nA = p\n+ + n°\nCHEMISTRY GRADE 9\n16The name of an element, its atomic number and mass number can be represented by\na shorthand symbol. For example, to represent neutral atoms of magnesium with 12\nprotons and 12 neutrons, the symbol is 24 12Mg. The atomic number is written as a\nsubscript to the left of the symbol of magnesium. The mass number is written as asuperscript to the left of the symbol. This method can be represented in general by\nthe following illustration, in which X stands for any chemical symbol.\nMass Number A\nAtomic Number Z Xo r X\n24\n12Mg can be read as “Magnesium-24”, and “Magnesium-25” represents25\n12Mg. In a\nsimilar manner, 23\n11Na can be read as “Sodium-23”.\nThe number of neutrons in an atom is found by subtracting the atomic number from\nthe mass number. For example, the number of neutrons for a silver atom (108\n47Ag) is:\nMass number – Atomic number = Number of neutrons\n108 – 47 = 61\n∴ The number of neutrons is 61.\nExample 1\nHow many protons, electrons, and neutrons are found in an atom of bromine-80\nif its atomic number is 35?\nSolution:\nAtomic number of bromine is 35.Mass number of bromine is already given as 80.

An atom of oxygen-16,\nfor example, has a mass of 2.657 × 10–23g. For most chemical calculations, it is more\nconvenient to use relative atomic masses. In order to set up a relative scale of atomic\nmass, one atom has been arbitrarily chosen as the standard and assigned a relative mass\nvalue.

The atomic mass of any atom is determined by\ncomparing it with the mass of the carbon-12 atom. The hydrogen-1 atom has an\natomic mass of about 1/12 of that of the carbon-12 atom, or about 1 a.m.u.

Based on the Rutherford's  atomic model, Bohr made\nthe following modifications.\n• The electrons in an atom can exist only in a restricted number of stable orbits\nwith energy levels in which they neither absorb nor emit energy. These orbitsdesignated by a number called the principal quantum number, n. The principal\nquantum number  has the values of 1, 2, 3, . . . The energy levels are also called\nshells . They are represented by K, L, M, . . . etc. The K-shell is the first shell,\nthe L-shell is the second shell, the M-shell is the third shell, etc.\n• When an electron moves between orbits it absorbs or emits energy. When an\nelectron jumps from lower to higher states it absorbs a fixed amount of energy.When an electron falls from a higher (excited) state to a lower (ground) state itemits a fixed amount of energy.\n• The electrons move around the nucleus  in energy levels.\nFigure 1.10   The first six energy levels in the Bohr model of an atom.\n• According to Bohr , for each element, the number of energy levels or shells is\nfixed.

Which sublevel will be occupied after the 3d sublevel is fully occupied?\nThe electrons are arranged in sublevels according to Aufbau principle which is also known as\nthe diagonal rule . The diagonal rule is a guide to the order of filling energy sublevels. It is\nparticularly helpful for atoms with atomic numbers higher than 18. This is because for atomswith higher atomic numbers their sublevels are not regularly filled.\nFigure 1.12  Diagonal rule for writing electron configuration.\nCHEMISTRY GRADE 9\n30If you list the orbitals following the direction of arrows, you can obtain the electron\nconfiguration of most atoms. Therefore, the order of filling the sublevels is given as:\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6...\nThe outermost occupied energy level of an atom is called the valence shell  and the\nelectrons that enter into these energy levels are referred to as valence electrons .\nExample 1\nWhat is the electron configuration of magnesium, 24\n12Mg?\nSolution:\n24\n12Mg = 1 s2 2s22p6 3s2   ﬁ in sublevel\n2     8      2   ﬁ in main energy level\nFrom this, we can write the configuration of elements by using a noble gas as\na core and the electrons outside the core. Note that noble gases have completeouter electron shells, with 2 or 8 electrons.
